All three nightmares share a common cause: These people had been placed under the care — and control — of legal guardians. America’s guardianship system was designed as a last resort to be used only in the rare and drastic event that someone is totally incapacitated by mental or physical disability. In those cases, conscientious guardians can provide vital support, often in complex and distressing circumstances. But an investigation by BuzzFeed News has found that the system has grown into a vast, lucrative, and poorly regulated industry that has subsumed more than a million people, many of whom insist they are capable of making their own decisions, and placed them at risk of abuse, theft, and even death.
The #FreeBritney movement has drawn international attention to the case of Britney Spears, and wrongdoing by individual guardians has surfaced in the past, but our investigation reveals the systemic failings behind these isolated stories.

A violent volcanic eruption on a South Pacific island triggered a tsunami advisory and flooding in Hawaii and parts of the West Coast on Saturday morning.Satellite footage showed a massive plume of ash and smoke and atmospheric shock waves following the eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano near Tonga on the evening of Jan. 14. Advertisement     The boom was reportedly heard as far away as New Zealand (more than 1,200 miles away) and Anchorage, Alaska (more than 5,800 miles away). The ash plume reached up to 12 miles into the air, Tonga Geological Services reported, and dozens of coastal areas, from Japan to Chile, triggered tsunami warnings.
 


Video footage from Tonga residents showed a swift, violent ocean tide rushing inland. One person told a New Zealand outlet that she felt the ground shake, saw water flood her home, and watched as the walls of a neighbor’s home collapsed. Resident Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau tweeted, “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.” Advertisement     
 


Nukuʻalofa, the capital of Tonga, is less than 50 miles south of the eruption, and many parts of the South Pacific island are reportedly experiencing a near-total power outage.The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami advisory for the West Coast states, Alaska, and Hawaii, meaning a ""potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water."" Waves 1 to 3 feet high were expected along the Oregon and Washington coasts.Maui and Kaua’i saw waves of 2.7 feet high, just under the criterion for a tsunami warning (3 feet). Hawaii's tsunami advisory was canceled just before 8 a.m. local time. National Weather Service reports advised people to stay away from beaches, harbors, and marinas, but said that widespread inundation was not expected.Japan's system issued warnings for Iwate prefecture to the north of its main Honshu island and for the Amami and Tokara islands to the south. Most of its east coast was placed under a tsunami advisory.Video in Santa Cruz, California, showed minor flooding along the coast. Cal Fire shared video of large waves hitting El Granada, California, on Saturday morning.
 


Most tsunamis are caused by large earthquakes, but they can also be triggered by landslides or volcanic eruptions. Although the eruption in Tonga was one of the most violent seen by orbiting weather satellites, the amount of water displaced would still be much less than can be caused by a major earthquake. Still, even relatively small surges in sea level can cause damage when water surges into bays and inlets.

3,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative. Advertisement     But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus.But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly. Advertisement     Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk. Advertisement     Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.”For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it. Advertisement  Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Center. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said.Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race. Advertisement  Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results.Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said. Advertisement  Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time.Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ● Advertisement

Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections. Advertisement     “I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said. Advertisement     Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down. Advertisement     “Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live. Advertisement     The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.”Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing. Advertisement     When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 19, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials could not specify exactly when on that day the site will go live). Advertisement     The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26.In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure. Advertisement     Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people. In symptomatic individuals, Tran said, the viral load is likely high enough that one test should be sufficient to tell if that person is infectious.

A plus-size woman who went viral after posing in a lime green athleisure outfit told BuzzFeed News that she hopes that one day we can get to a place where fat people buying clothes isn’t considered revolutionary.While plus-size mannequins have generally been embraced by brands and celebrated by activists as a step in the right direction for body acceptance, the sight of one didn’t seem to have the same impact on one conservative British TV host. Advertisement     “This, in a Regent St fitness store, is what obesity looks like. Flabby curves highlighted in hideous lime green velour,” tweeted Isabel Oakeshott, a GB News presenter who describes herself as a “professional feather ruffler.”The commentator criticized the window display at a London branch for Fabletics, which featured a plus-size mannequin dressed in a velour three-piece set, and called the body positivity movement “dangerous.”In response, Sophia Tassew, a content creator and business owner from London, served up the best reply when she shared a photo of herself looking fantastic in the “dangerous” outfit, which she went out to purchase for herself.
 


“That was my statement in itself,” Tassew told BuzzFeed News.“It's like, you guys are gonna have to get used to us. Thanks for sharing the fit. Now I'm going to cop it, and life goes on,” she said.The 24-year-old, who designs and owns a jewelry brand, wants it to be known that she “genuinely just liked the outfit.” She didn’t intend her response to be a major clapback, but Tassew said she recognizes that simply existing as a fat woman is seen by some as a statement.“Me, just being a plus-size person, I want a new outfit, and it's caused all this commotion, and it really shouldn't actually be that way, but it is,” Tassew said. “It's still seen as something that's a big deal, revolutionary, when we just want a new pair of leggings.”The reaction to her post has largely been positive, she said, noting that the store manager of that specific location told her that the mannequin in question has often prompted an emotional response from customers.“She gets people coming into her store crying because of the mannequin, and I was like, wow. So as long as it's done more good than anything, then I'm completely fine. I'm happy,” Tassew said.
 


Her post, which has more than 400K likes and over 30K retweets, prompted other women to share photos of themselves in the outfit.Tassew said that she no longer identified with the body positivity movement, calling them buzzwords and a movement that had been co-opted. Now, she champions the right to a quality of life.“I think my thing now is about fat liberation and just trying to understand how fat people can move around the world freely because obviously the world is not designed for us,” she said.The business owner has previously worked with the likes of fashion retailer Asos as a style insider and influencer, routinely modeling and creating content highlighting the best pieces for plus-size consumers.Since Tassew went viral, representatives for Fabletics have reached out to her. Fabletics, an athleisure brand cofounded by actor Kate Hudson, is routinely championed for having an inclusive offering, with sizes ranging from 0 to 24.Tassew is hopeful that her influence can be channeled into representing what it means to be fat in a world where anti-fat behavior persists.“It's so much deeper than just taking selfies to show your rolls,” Tassew said. “We're affected in so many ways that people don't actually realize, whether that be medically, financially, or socially.” Advertisement

Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally signed off on a secret advertising deal that allegedly gave Facebook special privileges on Google’s ad platform, according to newly unredacted court documents filed on Friday.The allegation is from a complaint first filed in December 2020 by Texas and several other states against Google for engaging in ""false, deceptive, or misleading acts"" while operating its buy-and-sell auction system for digital ads. In the complaint, state attorneys general claim Google illegally teamed up with Facebook, its fiercest competitor in the digital advertising market, for a 2018 deal Google dubbed “Jedi Blue” in a reference to Star Wars. Advertisement     Prior to the alleged deal, Facebook appeared to threaten Google's dominance in the market by backing an ad-buying technique called ""header bidding.""""Google understood the severity of the threat to its position if Facebook were to enter the market and support header bidding,"" the complaint reads. ""To diffuse this threat, Google made overtures to Facebook."" In the end, Facebook backed off after Google agreed to give the social network ""information, speed, and other advantages"" in auctions run by Google, the complaint says.The newly unredacted version of the complaint shows that the deal was allegedly struck at the highest levels of the companies, a noteworthy level of cooperation from two of the most powerful companies in the world.“Google CEO Sundar Pichai also personally signed off on the terms of the deal,” the unredacted complaint reads.The complaint also says the team working on the deal directly addressed Zuckerberg in an email, saying the company was “nearly ready to sign” and needed “approval” to move forward. Zuckerberg wanted to meet with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg before making a decision. The executives’ names are redacted from the complaint, but their titles are visible. Advertisement     The revelation comes as both Google and Facebook face a crackdown from state and federal officials over antitrust concerns for their business practices. Earlier this week, a judge rejected Facebook's motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission that accuses the social network of using anticompetitive tactics.Google on Friday said the lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, isn’t “accurate.”“We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don't require CEO approval, and this was no different,” Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels said in a statement. “And contrary to AG Paxton’s claims, the fact of this agreement was never a secret — it was well-publicized. It simply enables FAN [Facebook Audience Network] and the advertisers it represents to participate in Open Bidding, just like over 25 other partners do.”Meta, Facebook’s parent company, echoed Google’s assertion that the deal didn’t single out Facebook.“Meta’s non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements,” Meta spokesperson Stephen Peters said in a statement. “These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers while fairly compensating publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all.”Google says it plans to ask a judge to dismiss the case.

12,IT’S THE HUMIDITY!,"Nearly a year since their split, and it looks like both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are making the most of single life. As you may have heard, Kanye (now legally known as Ye) recently made his triumphant return to the dating circuit, going public with actor Julia Fox. After speculation about the nature of their relationship began swirling last month, Julia confirmed their romance last week, revealing in a blog post for Interview magazine that Ye had gifted her an entire hotel suite full of clothes on their second date. Since then, Ye and Julia have been practically inseparable, stepping out for numerous date nights and flaunting their newfound affection for one another at every possible occasion. And so, while her ex is pulling out all the stops for his new beau, it seems like Kim Kardashian is adopting a more casual approach to her love life. Off the back of Ye and Julia's well-documented debut, some Kardashian fans were left a little confused on Wednesday when Kim and her rumored boyfriend, Pete Davidson, were photographed enjoying an uncharacteristically low-key date night. On Tuesday evening, Pete and Kim — who were first romantically linked in October — ditched the typical celeb hot spots that LA has to offer, and opted for a chill dinner at a budget-friendly pizza chain. In stark contrast to Ye and Julia's recent date nights, Kim and Pete were photographed cozying up in a wooden booth as they shared pizza and sipped Diet Cokes. In keeping with the laid-back vibe, Kim swapped her usual Balenciaga statement looks for a dark sweater and leggings, blending in seamlessly with the other diners, who apparently barely noticed she was there. And for dessert, the casual duo relocated to a local Rite Aid drugstore where they grabbed some ice cream and engaged in a spot of PDA, before walking hand in hand back to their car — a refreshingly normal activity for two of the world’s most-talked-about people. To make matters more surprising, Tuesday night’s rendezvous wasn’t Kim and Pete’s only unusual outing this week. Just a day prior on Monday, an unsuspecting shopper snapped footage of the duo strolling around an outlet mall in Camarillo, California. The images were shared on social media and quickly published by Page Six, prompting a lot of confusion from fans. It still remains unclear what might attract a billionaire like Kim to an outlet mall, but nonetheless, it was reported that the couple paid a visit to a candy store where they picked up caramel apples and frozen bananas — a far cry from Kim's beloved Nobu. In years gone by, if you spotted Kim K browsing an outlet mall or nipping to a drugstore for a late-night ice cream run, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she might be lost. But — if her unlikely pairing with Pete was any indication — the past few months have shown that Kim is embarking on a totally new phase. And besides, as plenty of fans have pointed out, her revised outlook on life shouldn't come as a surprise. Fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians might remember that Kim spoke incredibly candidly about the breakdown of her relationship with Ye in the show’s finale episode, which aired in June last year. During a sit-down conversation with Kris Jenner — which was reportedly filmed about a month before she filed for divorce in Feb 2021 — Kim reflected on what she learned from her marriage and her hopes for moving forward. So, reflecting on life in her 40s, Kim hinted that her professional success had been tainted by the struggles in her marriage, explaining that she had no one to share her life with. “I feel like I’ve worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I’ve wanted to, and I’ve lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I even thought was humanly possible,” she began. “But I don’t have a life to share that with.” “But turning 40 this year, I was like, No, I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state,” she said, referring to the fact that the latter months of their marriage were split between her home in LA and Ye's preferred base in Wyoming. “I used to think that [living apart] was when we were getting along the best, but to me that’s sad and that’s not what I want,” she said. At this stage in the conversation, Kim went on to talk candidly about what she wanted from a future partner, emphasizing that common interests were important to her. “I want someone where we have the same [TV] shows in common. I want someone that wants to work out with me,” she said. “Every single day, Khloé, Tristan, and I would work out at 6 a.m., and I was third-wheeling it for a good eight months in quarantine, and I was so envious of that.” If you’ve been following Kimye for a while, you’ll know that grand gestures were a huge part of their relationship. From renting out an entire baseball stadium to hosting private concerts in their home, it’s no secret that Ye spared no expense when it came to his wife. In fact, even as recently as October 2020 — just three months before news of their split surfaced — Ye marked Kim’s 40th birthday by surprising her with an eerily realistic hologram of her father, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003. Shortly after this, it was reported that Kanye splashed out over $1 million on five Mercedes-Maybachs that he gifted Kim for Christmas, just a matter of weeks before their divorce went public. However, as she reflected on their years of marriage in the KUWTK finale, Kim realized that she had grown tired of Ye’s extravagance, and instead was yearning for the “smaller” and more meaningful experiences. “It’s the little things that I don’t have,” Kim said at the time. “I have all the big things. I have [everything] extravagant you could possibly imagine. And no one will ever do it like that [again]. I’m grateful for those experiences, but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.” Which brings us to now, and Kim's new approach to romance hasn't gone unnoticed by fans. After she and Pete were spotted on their pizza date this week, fans were quick to highlight how the uncharacteristically low-key outing made them think of Kim's comments about the extravagance of her marriage to Kanye. “This reminds me of when Kim said little things are more important for her,” one person wrote on Instagram beneath a photograph of Kim and Pete sharing pizza. In agreement, another fan reflected on Kim’s sentiments about Kanye, theorizing that his grand gestures had perhaps been more performative than meaningful. ""The thing is that those big things are for the world to see but the little things is what your heart sees and appreciates the most,"" someone else wrote. What's more, another huge talking point of Kim and Kanye's split has been its impact on Kim's style and overall image. In light of her new approach to dating, some fans suggested that her seemingly more laid-back attitude appears to have manifested in her style, noting that her looks have been more ""relaxed"" and ""casual"" recently. On the whole, it seems like fans are definitely happy to see Kim finally getting to embrace the ""little things"" in her love life, praising her ""newly found happiness"" after a turbulent year. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Kim is completely giving up her lavish lifestyle — she and Pete took a trip to the Bahamas just a few weeks ago. But, as one fan pointed out, it's great to see Kim finding a happy balance. And even though they've yet to officially confirm their romance, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that things are going pretty well between this unlikely pair. ""He makes her laugh, plays around and has a sense of humor,"" a source told Entertainment Tonight this week. ""It is nice for Kim to be around that. Pete knows how to talk to Kim. He is the most confident guy, but not cocky. It is why it works with them."" So, while Kim and Pete's coupling may have initially come as a surprise, it was perhaps on the horizon all along."
13,"Kim appears to be swapping extravagance for ease, and this is why it makes total sense.","


Teisha Hawley couldn’t believe her luck.The mother of three from South Jordan, Utah, had just won what she felt was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. She and her husband, Jeff, had been selected to have several rooms in their home renovated in October 2019 by an Instagram-famous couple, Candis and Andy Meredith, for a new television show. The Merediths, a couple from Utah with a blended family of seven children, had made a name for themselves in the DIY space with a 2015 HGTV show called Old Home Love, a 2017 book of the same name, and their project to convert a 20,000-square-foot 1907 schoolhouse into their family home.Candis told Hawley that the show, eventually called Home Work, would air on Magnolia Network, the soon-to-be-launched television network from Fixer Upper DIY superstars Chip and Joanna Gaines. According to Hawley, Candis told her that Joanna had personally looked at photos and said she liked the Hawleys’ house, which made Hawley feel like she was living “literally every person's dream.” Advertisement  For the Hawleys, the invocation of the Gaines name was everything. After Fixer Upper premiered on HGTV in 2013 and became the No. 1 unscripted series on all of cable television, the Gaineses have become the king and queen of home decor and renovation, with a line at Target and a series of stores and tourist attractions in their hometown of Waco, Texas. Earlier this month they officially launched their Magnolia Network as a joint venture with Discovery, with the aim of reclaiming “the best of what television can be.” Ahead of the launch, the network had premiered several shows from the network on Discovery Plus, including Home Work, which debuted with 13 episodes in July.
 


But to the Hawleys and three other homeowners who were selected in 2019 to be featured on Home Work, the network's launch was a different kind of milestone in what has become a multiyear fight.According to the Hawleys, their dream of a Magnolia-approved home renovation soon turned into a nightmare that left their kitchen, laundry room, and living room unusable, and the family down $35,000. Another homeowner, Aubry Bennion, has accused the Merediths of taking the $13,000 she paid them for a kitchen renovation and then leaving her project incomplete for months. When the renovation was completed, she claims the Merediths did a subpar job. Another pair of homeowners, Vienna and Rob Goates, said they paid the Merediths $50,000 for an addition to their home, but said the couple never completed any work. After this happened, the Goateses negotiated with the Merediths for a return of the money they paid, but have only been compensated for about a third of the deposit to date.On Wednesday, the Merediths posted a series of rebuttals to the claims of the three homeowners on their joint Instagram account. The Merediths denied many of the allegations against them, calling the “one-sided narrative” a series of “half truths and outright lies.” They said that while they understand home renovations can be difficult, they claim they did everything in their power to make their clients happy.“We have not heard from these clients in almost two years, and to have this come out publicly on the eve of the Magnolia network launch feels calculated and timed to hurt us the most. We have always been available for a resolution,” they said in part, adding, “We acknowledge that there were misunderstandings and hard conversations along the way, but just like with our many other happy clients, we did everything we could to resolve any issues that arose.”In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Candis said the couple are “very proud of the work that we’ve done.”“We've never stolen anything and we’re not out to take anybody else’s livelihood away the same way ours has kind of been taken here,” she said. “And we’re very proud of the show.”Multiple requests for comment to the Gaineses went unanswered.The homeowners, some of whom connected via mutual acquaintances in Utah and began sharing notes, said they had fought to get the Merediths, Discovery, and Magnolia to answer their allegations, but had gotten nowhere. Finally, Bennion decided to go public in a social media Hail Mary. She posted her account of the renovation on her Instagram page on Jan. 5, and the other women soon followed as an act of solidarity.Bennion’s account went viral, and Discovery and Magnolia Network quickly announced that they would be pulling Home Work from the streamer.“Magnolia Network is aware that certain homeowners have expressed concerns about renovation projects undertaken by Candis and Andy Meredith,” Allison Page, the president of Magnolia Network, told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Within the last several days, we have learned additional information about the scope of these issues, and we have decided to remove Home Work from the Magnolia Network line up pending a review of the claims that have been made.”However, late Thursday night, Magnolia Network announced that Home Work will be returning to the network. “After speaking with homeowners as well as Candis and Andy Meredith regarding renovation projects for Home Work, and hearing a mix of both positive and negative experiences, we do not believe there was ill or malicious intent,” Page told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Our commitment now is to provide appropriate resolutions for those whose experience with Home Work fell short of our network’s standards.” An attorney for the Hawleys and Bennion told BuzzFeed News they are ""encouraged,"" by Discovery's apparent desire ""to do the right thing and correct the situation,"" while the Goatses told BuzzFeed News they ""are relieved to see that Magnolia has stepped in and committed to take action.""At the time of publication, a spokesperson for Discovery did not respond to further inquiries about the allegations made by the three homeowners. Discovery also did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about which production company was behind Home Work and who was responsible for its operations. An IMDb page for Home Work lists the Merediths and one other person as executive producers (this individual did not return a request for comment). Candis told BuzzFeed News the show was coproduced by her and her husband’s production company and one other company, but declined to name either. It’s also difficult to verify what the actual Home Work show looked like, as all episodes have been pulled from the streaming platform.For Bennion, the Hawleys, and the Goateses, the online response to their story has been bittersweet. They are pleased to finally be heard, but they want to know why they had to go so public to have anyone involved pay attention. “For Magnolia’s reputation to be on the line and for them to be so seasoned in doing what they do at Discovery, why would they allow these amateurs to do this and never check on them?” Bennion told BuzzFeed News. (Discovery did not respond to a request for comment on this allegation.)The Goateses, who appeared in a trailer for Home Work despite the fact that their project had not even started, said they want some accountability from Discovery and Magnolia.“I don’t think that the Merediths would have gotten as far as they did without the credibility of the Gaineses and Magnolia and their brand,” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News.
 


For Bennion, the experience with the Merediths has been doubly disappointing because she had previously had such a good relationship with the Magnolia brand.Bennion works in project management full time but runs a small business, Hello Maypole, which sells felt balls and garlands, on the side. She has sold her products at Magnolia vendor fairs and even wholesale at Magnolia stores, she said. She also had a friendly relationship with the Merediths through her business’s Instagram page.So when she heard from a mutual friend that the Merediths were partnering with Magnolia, and then saw the couple put a casting call for a yet-to-be-announced show on their Instagram, where they have more than 100,000 followers, she was intrigued. After making and submitting a video for consideration, Bennion got the news she had been selected to have her kitchen renovated.The Hawleys and the Goateses told BuzzFeed News they responded to the same casting call on social media. Hawley had followed the Merediths on Instagram for a while, and was thrilled to be chosen for the show. They said with Candis’s claim that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their home, they felt especially “solid” about signing up. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever telling the Hawleys that the Gaineses saw their house and said the Gaineses had nothing to do with the selection process.)“Hearing Magnolia and then Chip and Jo's name being dropped as much as it was, I felt like that really built a trust in everything,” Jeff Hawley told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement  “I remember just thinking like, wow, this is a big deal,” Vienna Goates said. “It was hard for us to comprehend it at that point. But we just knew it was going to be great.”
 


The Hawleys agreed to renovate their kitchen, dining room, family room, and laundry room — essentially an entire floor — for the show. The Merediths told them the renovation would cost $45,000, which seemed low to the Hawleys, but they said they figured the Merediths knew best.(Homeowners on television renovation shows pay for their own renovations most of the time, according to HGTV. The network states that the draw of being on their shows is primarily getting to work with their designers, not getting things for free.)The couple filmed introductions at their home with a film crew and the Merediths, and the demolition started on Oct. 30, 2019. Hawley was a little concerned that the demolition had started before they had sent any money or signed a contract, but she said Candis told her things moved fast in television and they would figure it all out.Besides, she thought, this was Magnolia.“Magnolia’s here, they’re demoing without [us paying] any money,” Hawley said she thought. “Of course this is legit, you know?”After contractors demolished their first floor, the Hawleys and their three children moved into the basement without a kitchen or laundry. They said that the Merediths told them it would take no longer than three or four weeks, so they figured they could make it work for a short period of time. In November they received a contract from the Merediths and a request for $35,000, the balance owed for the renovation (the remaining $10,000 would cover furniture costs).According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they needed to wire the money as soon as possible. This was stressful because the couple had planned to pay for the renovation with a home equity loan, but now didn’t have time to arrange it.“So this wasn’t something we were able to finance,” Teisha Hawley said, adding that they drew the balance directly from their savings account.The Hawleys said after that, things stalled. At first, they chalked it up to the holidays. Then, more time passed.“We would repeatedly be told contractors would be there a certain day to only then be told there were delays or someone had quit and that we needed to be patient,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “Sadly our 3-4 week project was well into the 8-10 week range, we would have weeks go by without anyone coming or hearing a thing.” In the meantime, the family spent the holidays in their basement.“Living in the basement in Utah, when the weather is crappy and it’s snowy and dark, it takes a toll on you,” Hawley said.Across town, Bennion’s project for Home Work, which began the same month as the Hawleys, was also not proceeding as she had hoped. She had filmed the initial introduction with the Merediths for the show and said she had agreed to a $25,000 kitchen renovation that the Merediths said would take three weeks. Bennion wrote on Instagram that faced with the same timing issues and inability to get a home equity loan as the Hawleys, she had to borrow the funds from her parents.After demolition started on her kitchen, Bennion said the work also faced delays. She said she tried to put her faith in her prior relationship with the Merediths and the belief that things progressed differently on television, but she began to grow concerned as the project got more delayed. The morning of Thanksgiving 2019, the Merediths requested Bennion wire the funds. She sent them half, $13,000, the following Monday morning.
 


In mid-November, with no movement on the project, Bennion began pressing Candis for answers. After Candis showed her a vision board for the design for her home, she said she began to relax.“Seeing the design elements and the promise of a kitchen by Christmas was enough to keep the worries at bay and the momentum chugging, despite what was actually happening — or not — in my home,” she wrote on Instagram.However, Bennion said on Instagram, things continued to stall. As January turned into February, Bennion said she began to have “absolutely zero faith that any of it was real.”“I was certain I was being fed a line, the same line I had been for the three and a half months before with missing crews and poor work performed one or two days at a time, totaling less than two weeks of actual work days in my home,” she wrote.The Hawleys had also reached a crisis point. In early January, they met with the Merediths to discuss their project. According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they had already spent their entire budget and would now require another $35,000 to $40,000 to complete the work. The Merediths requested another $10,000 immediately via wire transfer in order to continue working on the project. The Hawleys were stunned.“Hopeless is the word that comes to mind when I think of that day,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “I had applied for this show and had put our family in this situation.” Advertisement  The couple decided they were done. In February, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, they told the Merediths they wanted to walk away. They said they had never signed their contract or any release allowing Magnolia Network to use their footage. They hired a contractor friend to get the rooms back into a “livable condition,” and have been slowly working on the project since. Two years later, the Hawleys said the experience with the Merediths has taken a toll.“The lack of communication, the lack of respect for our budget and the lack of respect for realizing my family was living in a basement truly makes me sick,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram.
 


In response to the Hawleys’ claims, the Merediths said that the budget increases were due to requests from the Hawleys, saying the “scope changed mutually.” “There was a list of ‘must haves’ that kept growing, and it was clear we needed to sit down to discuss anything they were hoping to increase,” the Merediths wrote. They denied having any knowledge the Hawleys were unhappy until they received a demand letter from the couple’s attorney, but Candis declined to elaborate to BuzzFeed News what it said.“We tried to reach out and offer any and all assistance, we were ignored. We had spent about $10,000 of our own money at this point. We offered solutions. We haven’t heard from them whatsoever in almost two years,” they wrote. The Hawleys, in a statement, told BuzzFeed News they had no ulterior motive for coming forward. “This isn’t just about project delays and a poor renovation experience. There are patterns of manipulation, dishonesty, and gross negligence here,” they said. Advertisement  The Goates family also filmed an introduction for the show in October 2019, during which Candis told them their addition, which would add a much-needed second bathroom for their family of seven, would be featured in the grand finale episode of Home Work. The Goateses were thrilled by Candis’s appreciation for their beloved cottage.“She said, ‘This is the biggest project’ and … ‘I’ve always wanted to do a house like yours,’” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News. The couple felt that their project was important to the Merediths and the network, and, when Candis told them a few months later that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their project, they even felt like the Gaineses were invested. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever saying this.)These sentiments helped them look past a series of what they now call red flags with the project. Their renovation, the Goateses said, was beset with delays from the start. They had originally been told the project could possibly be wrapped by Christmas 2019, which came and went. It wasn’t until Jan. 29, 2020, Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, that Candis finally told them “she’d met with all her contractors and was confident the project could go forward as planned.” The Goateses signed a contract and in February 2020 sent the Merediths a wire transfer for $50,000, half of the project’s total cost, as a deposit. They drew the funds from a home equity loan they had previously arranged.
 


According to the Goateses, still nothing happened. The couple said they frequently reached out for updates, but said Candis told them that COVID-19 was causing project delays. Finally, they heard a concrete update from Candis when, on April 29, 2020, she shared a trailer for Home Work with them. The Goateses said they were stunned to see themselves featured, as they had assumed they wouldn’t be making the cut because of the project delays.“We felt this was an effort to placate our anxiety,” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News. “Because at this point, I was like, have we been robbed? Is this some sort of con?” But seeing themselves in the preview made them feel more confident that their renovation would start soon.“That solidified at that point Chip and Joanna know what we're going through, and they’re excited about us because there we are on their channel,” Vienna Goates said.The couple’s relief was short-lived. In May, Rob Goates was laid off from his job, and no work had begun. The couple began to question if they should pull out of the project for financial reasons, but they said Candis convinced them to stay the course.“[Candis] was very kind and she said she’d spoken to production and they agreed they would make our HELOC [home equity line of credit] payments for us and help us financially so we could go forward with the project,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “Candis said that Joanna Gaines specifically had interest in our project, and that they all really wanted our renovation to continue to be on the show.”But by September 2020, with the renovation still not underway and money tight, the Goateses decided to quit.“You may think it was naive and foolish of us to let things go on even this long,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “You would be right. But a global pandemic makes a convenient excuse for many things, and honestly we were in absolute survival mode. Plus, we had faith in the reputation of Chip and Joanna and their beloved Magnolia brand and Candis’s repeated assurances that everything would work out.”Since then, the Goateses said, they have been fighting to get back the deposit they sent the Merediths. They hired a lawyer and Candis agreed to a judgment that stated the couple could sue if she did not refund the money. According to the Goateses, so far they have been refunded about $14,000 by the Merediths. Rob Goates estimates they have spent upward of $60,000 total on the debacle, including lawyer’s fees. They aren’t sure they will ever get their full deposit back.“There’s nothing quite like paying a bill on a huge balance that is literally for NOTHING,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, referring to their home equity loan.In their rebuttal, the Merediths claimed that after the Goateses asked for their deposit back, the unnamed contractor, whom they had paid the $50,000 to, told them he could not refund the money. So, they said, they agreed to refund the Goates family personally, confirming they had thus far paid them $14,000. “We care deeply about the Goates and we are taking this responsibility seriously,” they wrote.In response to the Merediths' public posting, the Goateses told BuzzFeed News, “We appreciate that they recognized the validity of our situation … however, there has been a lack of regular communication and transparency.“We tried every avenue possible to resolve this privately, our story and our paper trail speaks to that, and speaking out publicly was an extremely unfortunate last resort,” they said.Through word of mouth and mutual acquaintances, the Hawleys eventually connected with Bennion and began to share notes. Bennion’s renovation had also ended poorly, she told BuzzFeed News. In February, she had met with Candis, telling her she planned to quit the show and the project if it didn’t improve.During the meeting, Bennion wrote on Instagram, Candis told her that her project was now also costing way more than expected: $40,000. According to Bennion, Candis also said she had already spent the money. In their rebuttal, the Merediths claim they paid $32,000 of their own funds toward completing the project.“We’ve been using our own money and we can’t really afford to feed our kids,” Bennion said Candis told her. In response, Candis told BuzzFeed News that the remark was “taken out of context,” but fronting the costs of Bennion’s renovation did “put us into tricky situations with our family.”Although she was furious, Bennion believed she had leverage. “From my perspective, she needed my project to be complete more than I needed her to complete it for me,” Bennion wrote on Instagram, adding she believed this because she knew that couples had dropped out of the show. “As such, she was willing to push the financial conversation down the road a bit more, even after I told her she was working at risk.”The Merediths’ contractors eventually finished the kitchen and Bennion filmed a reveal for the show, but she said she never signed a contract or an appearance release for Magnolia. According to Bennion, the finished product has been rife with problems and shoddy work.“I’ll never show the finished product on the internet because it cleans up nice and, with the right filter, is worthy of every wow and word of praise for everyone who doesn’t have to live in it or had to live through what it took to get there,” she wrote on Instagram.The Merediths fiercely denied Bennion’s allegations on Instagram, saying, “[Bennion’s Instagram handle] has made false claims and is purposely trying to take anything she can from us.” They claimed the renovation of her kitchen was done well and posted several videos that they claimed showed Bennion happy with the end result.“We are very proud of the work that went into this project,” they wrote. “We revealed this space on February 20, 2020 and fully acknowledge that before this point in time there were hard conversations and misunderstandings about this project and budget, but we were absolutely under the impression that we had resolved those issues together. If Aubry was unhappy at this point overall, we had no idea whatsoever.”Candis told BuzzFeed News that the majority of Bennion’s complaints about the project’s delays were out of her control as the delays were because of the contractors and workers. She said she and Andy decided not to attempt to recoup the $32,000 they spent of their own money on Bennion’s project because they “didn't want that kitchen to feel anything but positive for her overall.”“I just wanted her to feel at peace. And if that meant that I had spent that money, that was OK,” she said. Bennion told BuzzFeed News that while she did feign excitement during parts of the project, “It is easy to be selective in memory. The truth is that there are many text messages, which I still have record of, that show I was very dissatisfied regularly throughout the project.”
 


Since the homeowners began to share notes in spring 2020, they said they have been working to figure out some sort of restitution. Both the Hawleys and Bennion said they consulted attorneys, who told them even if they had a judgment against the Merediths, it’s unlikely they would ever see a dime. In addition to consulting attorneys, they also in 2021 filed complaints against the couple with the Utah Department of Commerce’s Consumer Protection Division.“We did everything in our power to contact everybody we could to make sure that this was taken care of and nothing was ever addressed or taken care of or anything,” Teisha Hawley said.
 


For a long time, the Goateses said they told themselves that Magnolia, Discovery, and the Gaineses couldn’t possibly know what had happened. If they knew, they thought, they would do something to fix it. In August 2021, they decided to attempt to contact the network and Magnolia, emailing a customer service line. They got a response from an attorney for Discovery, who told them in an email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, that the network would encourage the couple to address their concerns directly with the Merediths.“We do not believe it would be helpful for Discovery to try and mediate this matter, especially since counsel is already involved and you have already sought legal recourse,” the attorney wrote in part. The attorney added that the network understood that the Merediths would “like to resolve the outstanding balance that is owed.”“At that point, we just hung our heads and cried because we were like, what more can we do?” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News.All the homeowners said they have been validated by the response on social media to their stories, although going so public has taken a toll. Since Bennion and the others’ accounts went viral, a Utah real estate agent, Aaron Oldham, posted an hourlong IGTV video describing what he said was his own poor experience working with the Merediths on a renovation in 2013. Commenters on Oldham’s video also began to do their own sleuthing on the couple, highlighting a 2020 lawsuit against them for appearing as celebrity endorsers for the real estate seminar company Zurixx.While Bennion said she has appreciated the support, she was disappointed about how difficult it was to get Magnolia Network to respond to her claims. Since she had never interacted with anyone from the network directly, she said, she initially had no contact to seek restitution from.Finally, through her contacts on the purchasing side of the Magnolia company, she said she was connected with Magnolia’s attorney and asked them if she could break an NDA she signed as part of her wholesale agreement to share her story. Bennion shared her experience with the Magnolia team, who, she said, blamed the issue on the show’s production company. The Hawleys said they also contacted Magnolia through their attorney, but said they were told the network said it was not its responsibility.Bennion said she has found the experience hard to reconcile with the version of the Magnolia brand she had loved.“Magnolia shouldn’t be surprised because we gave them a fair shake to do their part,” she said.But when the show rolled around, they began to question how much they had been “taken advantage of.”“As the show launched and we saw how happy and successful and fun it was and we were just left out in the cold, that was really violating,” Rob Goates said.Hawley said she just wants someone to be accountable for what happened to her.“What I have posted, it’s not to trash Magnolia,” Hawley told BuzzFeed News. “I just want them to be better. Their name, people across the entire country trust it. And so the fact that this has happened under their brand is just devastating to me.” ●

KYIV — After Russia massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border in recent weeks, the Biden administration said it believes Moscow is preparing to again invade its Eastern European neighbor.“The United States is concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion into Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” a US official told BuzzFeed News on Friday. Advertisement     “As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.”The statement, on the heels of unsuccessful high-stakes negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, was Washington’s strongest and most ominous yet on the latest Russian aggression targeting Ukraine.It also echoes a report published earlier Friday by Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. That report warned that Russian special services are preparing a provocation against Russian soldiers and targeting an arms depot in the Transnistrian region of Moldova where Putin has peacekeepers. The goal, the intelligence agency said, was also to create an excuse to launch an attack on Ukraine.The US official said intelligence showed the Russian military plans to begin its activities “several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February.” Advertisement     “We saw this playbook in 2014 with Crimea,” the official added, referring to Moscow’s annexation of that peninsula and the subsequent war it fomented in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.US intelligence, said the official, indicates Russia has already recruited a group of operatives to carry out a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine.“The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy-forces,” the official said.The official said further information indicated that “Russian influence actors” working for state-run news outlets and on social media are hard at work fabricating “Ukrainian provocations” to justify a new Russian intervention and sow discord in Ukraine.“For example, Russian officials and influence actors are emphasizing narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders,” the official said.“These media narratives also blame the West for escalating tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage domestic support for military action.”The Biden administration told BuzzFeed News that in December it tracked Russian-language content on social media “covering all three of these narratives” and saw its output increase to an average of about 3,500 posts per day — a 200% increase from the daily average in November.The US warnings came as a massive cyberattack hit dozens of Ukrainian government websites. The hackers behind the attack posted a message warning Ukraine to “be afraid and expect worse.”Ukrainian government officials told BuzzFeed News that it was too soon to know for sure who was behind the attack, but they pointed the finger at Moscow.

Jamie Lynn refuted Britney’s claim shortly after the testimony, and instead maintained that she’s always “loved” and “supported” her sister.
 


“When [the conservatorship] was put into place I was a 17-year-old. I was about to have a baby, so I didn’t understand what was happening,” she said. “Nor was I focused on that. I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby. I understand just as little about it then as I do now.”

WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.”For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it. Advertisement  Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Center. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said.Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race. Advertisement  Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results.Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said. Advertisement  Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time.Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ● Advertisement

18,House and Senate races can be overturned by a majority vote.,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.The North Star Boys first appeared on my TikTok feed last summer, exiting an elevator and throwing nonchalant but sexy glances at the camera. Then ripping off their shirts. Standing in a line sucking on lollipops. Eating whipped cream. Fabricating secret admirer videos about themselves. Every time, I would be introduced to their content via someone’s satirical take on their Horny Behavior. Advertisement     This collective of seven Asian American content creators first rose to prominence for “go girl give us nothing” seductive TikToks, garnering a large fanbase by pushing the boundaries of fan fiction and TikTok’s community guidelines. The North Star Boys’ account currently boasts 4.8 million followers, while individual members like Oliver Moy have around 11.6 million.According to the group’s YouTube channel, their mission is simply “to be an inspiration to Asian Americans.” Euphemistically, they’ve become known as the “pick your Asian” group, a way for Asian men to fetishize themselves for white audiences. But recently these purveyors of thirsty heterosexual Asian content found themselves in political controversy after they posed in front of a wall with the slogan “Stop Asian Hate.”
 


The Stop Asian Hate movement gained traction in 2021 after a rise in racist and violent attacks against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was largely personified by rallies organized across the country to protest the brutality and show solidarity, particularly in the wake of Vicha Ratanapakdee’s death as well as the Atlanta spa shooting.Which is why followers didn’t love it when the North Star Boys used it as a backdrop for their latest group photo. “it’s giving kendall jenner pepsi,” one commenter wrote. “i’d rather be called a slur,” another said.
 


The viral photo also spawned several TikToks making light of it, including one by Alex Lee, 20, a student at the University of Southern California.“It was comical, and then once you think about it more, maybe a little more concerning,” he told me. “This term reached new heights in its meaning during COVID-19, when Asian elders and community members were really under attack, physically and verbally abused for our identity. But these seven guys are looking cute in front of it.” Advertisement     In response to the uproar, the influencers posted two response videos, on TikTok and YouTube. “That is not a thirst trap. And we are not activists, nor do we try to be,” said Oliver Moy, his fellow Boys seated around him.
 


The caption on TikTok read: “To those who are mocking us with your TikToks, I want to ask you to ask yourself, ‘What are you doing for the movement?’”And, well, the commenters mocked that too.
 


“When influencers use these hashtags as a way to prove they’re ‘woke,’ without clarifying the action items they’re following to benefit the movement, people lose sight of the meaning,” Lee said. “The words lose impact, and that becomes detrimental to the purpose of these terms.” Advertisement     The founders of Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of organizations who founded and popularized the initial hashtag, declined to respond directly about the North Star Boys’ controversial post, but provided a statement about the movement’s work tracking Asian hate crime incidents.“It's vital we continue to push for real solutions through investment in civil rights, community resources and education, including ethnic studies in schools,” they said.Influencers taking lukewarm, Instagram-friendly stands against targeted racial violence is not a new phenomenon (remember the black squares?). The pressures of social media aesthetics have led these efforts to be diluted into general phrases, the action items left behind. Male influencers doing a sexy walk with pumpkins on their heads is not really the inspiring Asian representation I had asked for.“You need to tell your teammate when they make a bad decision on the court,” Lee said. “We have the same goal as Asian Americans. I don’t think the North Star Boys had bad intentions. I really don’t think they were trying to be malicious or derogatory.

KYIV – After days of unsuccessful negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, hackers took down dozens of Ukrainian government websites and posted an ominous warning on several for the country to “be afraid and expect worse.”The cyberattack occurred overnight on Thursday and Friday morning, and it took down more than a dozen official websites, disrupting government work and raising questions about whether Russia was signaling that a new offensive against Ukraine was getting underway. Advertisement     Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, told BuzzFeed News that government specialists were working to restore the websites Friday morning and the Ukrainian Cyberpolice Department had opened a criminal investigation. “It’s too early to draw conclusions,” he said. ""We are assessing the damage caused by the attack.""But some in Ukraine’s government see Russian fingerprints all over the attack and are already blaming Moscow, which has massed around 100,000 soldiers near the Ukrainian borders and threatened a “military response” against its neighbor unless the US and NATO concede to its demands.“It’s pretty obvious [Russia is responsible] because hardly anyone else has the motive for such actions,” a Ukrainian official told BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak on the sensitive matter.Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, during an online event with the Atlantic Council think tank, stopped short of accusing Russia of the cyberattack by name but suggested that it had a role in it. “It’s one of the potential parts of the destabilization of Ukraine,” he said. Advertisement     Officials in Russia didn't immediately return a request for comment.Ukrainian and US officials have warned that if Russia were to launch a fresh invasion of Ukraine it would likely do so in conjunction with cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that the US intelligence community has information that suggests Russia is laying the groundwork to fabricate a pretext for invading Ukraine.A source with knowledge of recent cybersecurity initiatives in Ukraine told BuzzFeed News hours before the cyberattack that Kyiv and Washington had recently seen a “substantial uptick” in Russian cyber activity targeting Ukrainian systems and planting malware.The source said there was evidence to show the malware was designed to be planted and remain idle until a command would be given by the hackers behind it. “So they don’t need to hack anything when the [shooting] war starts. … The hack already happened,” the source explained. “They just push the button.”“We call this preparing the battlefield,” the source said.
 


Most of the Ukrainian websites targeted late Thursday and early Friday registered error messages when visited. But hackers replaced the homepage on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website with a message written in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish. “[Every] Ukrainian!” it said. “All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.” Advertisement     The message also included references to Ukrainian nationalist fighters in World War II and atrocities committed by them against Poles at the time, which has been a point of tension between the two countries despite their close relationship. Some Ukrainians saw that as a ruse to blame Warsaw for the attack.The Cyberpolice Department said it is working with the State Special Communications Service and the Security Service of Ukraine “to collect digital evidence and identify those involved in the cyber attacks.” No personal or official government data was stolen in the attack, it added.Ukraine has been the target of several large-scale cyberattacks since 2014, the year Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and fomented the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly insisted that the attacks are part of Moscow’s “hybrid war” — a combination of cyberwarfare, disinformation, and conventional military warfare — against it. Russia has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks.Past incidents saw attacks on the Ukrainian power grid, government agencies, transportation systems, and businesses. A 2017 attack known as NotPetya emanated in Kyiv but quickly spread to companies across the globe, causing significant damage.The New York Times reported last month that the US and UK had sent experts to Kyiv to help Ukraine on the cyber front, foreseeing the likelihood of cyberattacks as Russia ratcheted up tensions with its neighbor. Advertisement     President Vladimir Putin has gathered some 100,000 troops and heavy artillery around the border of Ukraine, raising concern in Kyiv and Western capitals that the Kremlin might be preparing to invade anew. Moscow has denied it is prepping for an attack and said that what it does with its military within its borders is its business.High-stakes discussions between the US, NATO, and Russia in Geneva, Brussels, and Vienna this week failed to secure a deal to see Moscow pull back its troops and military equipment.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters Thursday that Washington and NATO “are not ready to meet"" Russia's ""key requirements.” Among those is a guarantee that Ukraine can never join the western military alliance. The US and Ukraine have called the demand a non-starter.Ryabkov and other Russian government officials said further talks would be useless.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an ominous warning following a meeting with the Russians in Brussels on Wednesday. “There is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe,” he said.

President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms, in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country.“Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one,"" he said. ""We missed this time. We missed this time.” Advertisement     After traveling to Georgia earlier this week — in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there — Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules, which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills.But after his meeting with senators, the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.“I hope we can get this done, but the honest to god answer is I don’t know whether we can get this done,” Biden said.Normally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate. Democrats have only a 50–50 majority, including the tiebreaker, and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority. Advertisement     At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, oppose this plan, dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need. Sinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills, but not changing the Senate rules to pass them. She said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the “disease of division” that has broken American politics.Democrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway, knowing they don’t have the numbers. It’s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose, but Democrats say this issue is unique.“I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here. You’re either for democracy or you’re not,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said. “It’s important to have, frankly, every one of us on the record.”Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats’ doomed push.“It makes perfect political sense,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “If you’re Joe Biden, you’ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power. If you’re Chuck Schumer, you’ve got to call the question or you’re going to get a primary. If you’re in a purple or a red state, it’s probably good politics for you. So this is perfectly good politics for both sides.”The voting rights package, named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis, would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions, create nationwide minimum early voting day standards, make Election Day a federal holiday, and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups. Advertisement     Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive. Voting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia, where several of those bills were enacted, boycotted Biden’s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures.Several of those leaders, from groups including Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia.Seemingly in response to that criticism, in an email to those leaders on Wednesday, the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday “to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation” before thanking them for their “work and advocacy on this issue.”On Thursday, two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president’s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don’t have a chance of passing right now.“Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand,” said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. “We have no luxury of, or privilege of, delaying this any longer. And so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.” Advertisement     Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway.“He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want,"" Ufot said. ""I’m not in a position to figure that out, but he can, so I think that feels like a next step.""Ufot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority.“We care deeply about this issue, because fuck these elected officials, we care about our families, we care about our communities, and that doesn't go away,” Ufot said.“We're not going anywhere. And we're never going to shut up about this.”

22,"The attack comes as Russia is massing 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border.","


As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

23,"After his meeting with senators, President Biden indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.","


President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms, in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country.“Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one,"" he said. ""We missed this time. We missed this time.” Advertisement     After traveling to Georgia earlier this week — in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there — Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules, which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills.But after his meeting with senators, the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.“I hope we can get this done, but the honest to god answer is I don’t know whether we can get this done,” Biden said.Normally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate. Democrats have only a 50–50 majority, including the tiebreaker, and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority. Advertisement     At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, oppose this plan, dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need. Sinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills, but not changing the Senate rules to pass them. She said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the “disease of division” that has broken American politics.Democrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway, knowing they don’t have the numbers. It’s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose, but Democrats say this issue is unique.“I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here. You’re either for democracy or you’re not,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said. “It’s important to have, frankly, every one of us on the record.”Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats’ doomed push.“It makes perfect political sense,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “If you’re Joe Biden, you’ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power. If you’re Chuck Schumer, you’ve got to call the question or you’re going to get a primary. If you’re in a purple or a red state, it’s probably good politics for you. So this is perfectly good politics for both sides.”The voting rights package, named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis, would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions, create nationwide minimum early voting day standards, make Election Day a federal holiday, and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups. Advertisement     Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive. Voting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia, where several of those bills were enacted, boycotted Biden’s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures.Several of those leaders, from groups including Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia.Seemingly in response to that criticism, in an email to those leaders on Wednesday, the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday “to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation” before thanking them for their “work and advocacy on this issue.”On Thursday, two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president’s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don’t have a chance of passing right now.“Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand,” said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. “We have no luxury of, or privilege of, delaying this any longer. And so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.” Advertisement     Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway.“He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want,"" Ufot said. ""I’m not in a position to figure that out, but he can, so I think that feels like a next step.""Ufot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority.“We care deeply about this issue, because fuck these elected officials, we care about our families, we care about our communities, and that doesn't go away,” Ufot said.“We're not going anywhere. And we're never going to shut up about this.”

For years, Facebook moderators employed by third-party contractors have sought to expose poor working conditions, and their dissent grew louder during the pandemic as many were forced to return to the office with little to no safety net. But Spanish-language moderators say they face even worse treatment than their English-focused colleagues.
 


At the Richardson, Texas, office of Genpact, a Meta subcontractor, Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they’ve been required to report to the office since April 2021, despite the emergence of both Delta and Omicron variants that caused COVID infections to spike across the US. Throughout this time, they said, moderators reviewing English-language content have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.“Being in the office … has been nothing short of a nightmare,” one moderator said.BuzzFeed News spoke to three members of Genpact’s so-called Mexican market team who described a pattern of inequitable treatment of Spanish-language moderators. All of these individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity as Genpact requires them to sign nondisclosure agreements and they feared for their jobs. They said that in addition to reporting to the office for the last nine months while their English-language counterparts could work from home, Spanish-language moderators are held to unrealistic performance standards and are not compensated for working in two languages, which they say is more time-consuming. In addition, they face the pressures of managing a Facebook market that has long been criticized as under-moderated amid the threat of active COVID cases.Genpact spokesperson Danielle D’Angelo declined to comment on all of the specific claims made by Spanish-language moderators, including the claim that its Mexican market team was not allowed to work from home while other teams were rotated out.“We would like to stress that employee safety is our top priority and that has and will remain so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” D’Angelo said. “Any return to office decisions that are made in alignment with client needs are done with best safety and health practices in place and in accordance with local regulations. In all of our workplace locations, including our Richardson, TX office, we follow best-in-class safety standards, which includes frequent antigen testing.”On Thursday, managers at Genpact’s Richardson site reportedly told company agents that it has scrapped plans to reopen at 50% capacity on Jan. 31 due to the Omicron variant. Spanish-language moderators said this change does not affect them, and they will continue reporting to the office. Genpact declined to comment on when it intends to reopen, and at what capacity.In late June, Genpact leadership sent an email to one of the English-language moderation groups allowed to rotate out of the office, thanking them for their ""continued dedication and responsiveness."" The email said they would return to working from home on July 26.Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they received no such email. Days after English-language moderators were told they could go back home, “[managers] told us we were a specialized queue, and that our job could not be done outside of the office,” one moderator said, noting that the Mexican market often involves moderating a deluge of particularly graphic content. Facebook declined to comment on the complaints of its Spanish-language moderators, referring BuzzFeed News to Genpact — a strategy it has taken time and again when addressing the concerns of people who make their living moderating Facebook content.Since returning to the Richardson office, employees have grown increasingly fearful for their safety. Moderators told BuzzFeed News that 30 COVID cases were reported to staff by management in December, and that no updates have been communicated since then. Meanwhile, workers say their colleagues continue to test positive for COVID, citing two cases on one floor last week. Genpact declined to comment on the number of COVID cases in its office or how frequently it reports these cases to staff.On Dec. 22, a dozen Spanish-language moderators left the office en masse after learning through the grapevine that a sick colleague may have exposed them to the virus. Since workers claim that Genpact does not currently offer its moderators paid sick leave, they used PTO to self-isolate. Genpact declined to comment on whether its moderators are provided paid sick leave.Despite being named for the Mexican market, this team reviews Facebook and Instagram content posted in Spanish by users across most of Latin America as well, moderators said. As of 2018, there were 84 million Facebook users in Mexico, and tens of millions more using WhatsApp. In Latino and Spanish-speaking communities, Facebook has been a powerful vector of misinformation, shaping the public’s perception of topics such as COVID, election politics, and Black Lives Matter. But researchers studying misinformation told the Guardian that compared to English-language posts, harmful content posted in Spanish is removed less frequently.
 


Members told BuzzFeed News that Genpact began building this team in early 2020, initially sourcing volunteers from other existing departments.“Genpact made everyone who has a remotely Hispanic-sounding name take a Spanish test, and if they failed they were asked to take it again,” one moderator told BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity, fearing they could face retaliation for speaking publicly about internal company matters.Employees claim that moderators not fluent in Spanish were forced into the role as a result and that many failed to meet performance expectations and were subsequently fired. Currently, the Mexican market team consists of roughly 50 people.But even workers fluent in Spanish feel beaten down by what they characterized as unreasonable standards. For example, moderators are expected to maintain an 85% accuracy rate while sticking to a 66-second “handle time,” or time frame for making decisions on pieces of content. While these thresholds might be sensible for one language, navigating dual languages can take more time. Moderators say they have to translate Facebook guidelines, which are only disseminated in English, into Spanish before applying them. A large number of posts by users in Mexico and across Latin America also contain English, they added, forcing them to switch between languages regularly. Genpact declined to comment on how Spanish-language moderators are evaluated and paid. Facebook did not respond to a query about the language in which its guidelines are provided.The pandemic has caused Facebook moderators at several outsourcing firms to organize around issues such as paid sick leave, hazard pay, and the class system dividing contract workers from salaried tech employees. Last week, Accenture suddenly allowed its Facebook moderators to work from home after originally ordering them back to the office, following a BuzzFeed News inquiry.Though Facebook has never publicly revealed how many users it has throughout Latin America, its platform and apps function as vital utilities for citizens of many of these countries. That pressure is felt by Genpact’s Spanish-language moderators, who said that despite the outsize importance of their jobs, they’re the smallest team in the office.Facebook spokesperson Kadia Koroma said the company uses a “combination of technology and people to keep content that breaks our rules off of our platform, and while AI has made progress in this space, people are a key part of our safety efforts.” The company said that Spanish is one of the most common languages used on Facebook and that Spanish-language reviews are conducted 24 hours per day at several sites across the world.Moderators who returned to the office in April assumed it was due to Mexico’s midterm elections, which were held in June. “We figured, OK, let the election pass,” one moderator said. Throughout 2021, English-language moderators had been rotating in and out. The Mexican market team figured it would be the same for them.“Then a week before we were supposed to be rotated out, we got an email saying, ‘Thank you for the hard work, but unfortunately the Mexican market is going to stay in place,’” they added. Facebook declined to comment on how it interacts with subcontractors managing specific moderation markets.“We know these jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams,” Koroma said.

KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI — “Stop the car!” a police officer yells in the video, pulling out his gun as a silver Audi minivan kicks it into reverse, swerving away from him. The officer runs after the car.“Get out, get out, get out,” the officer says, his words blending together. He aims his gun with one hand at the Black man driving and holds his radio with the other.A fast-moving situation. An officer with a drawn weapon. A Black man suspected of a crime. Bystanders screaming at the police that the man behind the wheel has a mental condition. And a video broadcast on social media. Time and time again the world has seen these videos end in tragedy. Advertisement  But no one is shot in this video. At the tensest moment, a soundtrack amps up music that would fit in a Fast & Furious trailer. Without incident, the officer gets the driver out of the car and takes him to a hospital for mental health treatment.This video, which was uploaded in July 2020 and has more than 87,000 views, is one of hundreds the Miami Police Department has put out since it started vlogging in 2015 (the most popular has 3.4 million views). Miami is just an early adopter of a renewed tactic. Now, police departments across the nation are producing slick videos, pushing a “good cop” image after years of outrage over shootings, many captured on video and published to social media, and the resulting protests demanding accountability. The New York Police Department has posted over 800 videos to its channel, including web series called Beyond the Badge and Neighborhood Policing. The Los Angeles Police Department regularly posts bodycam and security footage, sometimes cutting it together with a moving score, like this video of an officer providing first aid to a man injured during riots after an LA Lakers championship game.The videos continue the tradition, popularized by shows like Cops and Live PD, of glorifying police work via highly edited, suspenseful, “documentary”-style entertainment. But these are coming from the departments themselves, with police employees editing and uploading the clips right to YouTube. A new form of “copaganda,” as activists refer to it. There has been a boom in these shows and channels over the past 19 months, after both Cops and Live PD — criticized for years for glorifying police work and perpetuating racial stereotypes — were canceled amid the summer 2020 protests. (Cops is now making a return on Fox Nation.)Current and former spokespeople for five different police departments said these videos help with “public education,” “community outreach,” recruiting, and morale.But most critically some officials say they are made to counteract the dominant online presence of the police accountability and reform movements of the past eight years. Advertisement  When video of George Floyd being choked to death started circulating around the world, “every police department that was watching that in the country went. Oh, F.U.C.K. is this going to hit us?” said Lauri Stevens, the founder of SMILE, an annual conference, awards, and training outfit for law enforcement social media use.“And it did, and they knew it. They knew it from the minute it happened, it’s going to come down on us.”The reaction among departments was an age-old tactic strengthened by new technology: Drive the narrative you want to get out.Still, some of the officers who make the videos are reckoning with their involvement in them. Take Officer Malcolm Whitelaw of the Kansas City Police Department, who was at the vanguard of his department’s video strategy. He’s also grappling with being the public face of the very system that’s caused him fear in the past.
 


I followed Whitelaw for a few days this summer as he made and edited a video about applying to become a police officer. The goal was to boost recruitment. Advertisement  We walked around police communications and media headquarters in Kansas City, the department recruitment office, and the police academy as he filmed in selfie mode, explaining how to apply and what someone should expect if they are accepted into the academy.“People tell me my videos look like Live PD, but I don’t really think so,” Whitelaw said when the camera stopped rolling. “I’m still kind of figuring out my style.”Whitelaw, who is Black, is a 29-year-old former marketing student who has been on the force for six years. He’s hulking and friendly, with a squinty smile.Whitelaw loves working as a police officer, but, he told me repeatedly, he doesn’t consider it his identity the way he believes many of his colleagues do. It’s just a job, he said. At the end of the day, the badge comes off. Then he’s just Malcolm.He was a patrol officer before he started making videos for the department at the beginning of 2021. The videos were his idea, inspired in part, though maybe subconsciously, he conceded, by his experience patrolling last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.“As I was standing there, there were some girls, like, yelling at me, and I kind of got confused because this is a young white girl telling me that I don’t understand what it means to be Black,” Whitelaw said, sitting at a conference table with his two white bosses, who were nodding along. “And I’m like, I have more experience in this field than you.”Later, during a break from shooting a video in the recruitment office, away from his colleagues, we discussed the issue further.“I’m a police officer, and I’m also Black. No confusion there. And so my experience as a police officer is very different sometimes than those that don’t share my skin complexion. Because, well, where do we police? Right? We police in areas with people that look like me,” Whitelaw said, his voice lowering an octave. Advertisement  For Whitelaw, and for the Black protesters he was patrolling, dealing with police hostility and brutality had been a reality their whole lives.When Whitelaw was a sophomore in high school, living just outside of Kansas City, he said, he was walking home from school when suddenly an officer pulled up and, gun out, stopped him. Whitelaw didn’t know what was happening and the officer didn’t explain, he said, but kept telling him to stay where he was. Soon, several more cops pulled up around him. They held him there until they figured out he wasn’t the guy they were looking for.“I matched the description,” Whitelaw added. He was scared, and his mother was furious.“Growing up, I didn’t like the police, I wouldn’t talk to the police,” Whitelaw said. “My head was hardwired like that. That was a huge hurdle to get over because I had all the same thoughts as the people that don’t like the police. You know, I had started working for a department” — he later clarified his encounter with police was with a nearby department — “that pulled me over at gunpoint.”Whitelaw said he regularly encounters people who still think that way, who see him as a traitor for being a Black police officer. Because of that, he said, he finds himself having to “exist in that place as a human being, not so much getting caught up in my skin color.”“There’s people who look at me and they hate me that much more because I’m Black. ‘How dare you?’ You know, like, ‘How dare you be a police, you know what they’ve done to us.’ That’s what people are thinking,” Whitelaw said. Advertisement  “It’s sometimes so disheartening because it’s like, I’m the best person to have right here, you know. Because I’m not looking at you because of who you — because of this situation,” he stumbled over his words. “I’m looking beyond that. We can handle our business, and I’m gonna treat you as a person you want to talk to with respect.”He hopes to bring some of this understanding into his videos. Whitelaw has been obsessed with YouTube since he was a teen, fantasizing about creating his own videos and becoming a sensation on the platform. After watching Miami’s police vlogs religiously, he decided that his department should do something similar.The chief approved it, and Whitelaw’s been on special assignment in the media unit since the beginning of 2021. When I was with him in August, he said that so far the office had given him almost free rein. He taught himself video editing and about equipment online and invested a significant chunk of his own money (though he wouldn’t say how much) in cameras and lenses. The department put out its first vlog in March.
 


After the first couple of YouTube videos, the KCPD YouTube channel had a 1,000% increase in viewership — this is according to Whitelaw — and saw 1,400 new subscribers in the first few weeks. Things have steadied since then. As of mid-January, the KCPD had published its ninth video and had nearly 7,000 subscribers. Whitelaw also recently launched a KCPD TikTok page, hoping to reach a younger, wider audience. Advertisement  Right after the channel launched, he started getting inundated with requests from officers in other departments to be featured on the videos. Pro-police commenters leave positive feedback and aspiring officers use the forum to ask Whitelaw questions in the comments about how to become a cop. He has even started getting recognized in public, he said.Whitelaw’s hope for these videos is that they show the benefits of community policing, not just to the public but to current and future officers. Officers, with burnout, social pressures, and a high-intensity work environment, sometimes need a reminder of why they got into the force, Whitelaw said.“As police officers, a lot of times we have to be so rigid, right?” Whitelaw said. “We’re dealing with, you know, traumatic events, and sometimes when you’re out there, you kind of forget to be a person. So that’s what I try to get people to feel and remind them: You are a person.”He added that it doesn’t hurt that the videos help boost morale, by making officers feel badass, “seeing themselves with cool music and, you know, different shooting angles, and seeing how much fun people are having.”
 


While I was with the KCPD, Whitelaw made a video about the testing process for applicants to get into the police academy. It came after the chief requested that the KCPD up its recruiting game.The plan was to follow the latest group of applicants as they took the exams. Whitelaw gave his followers a tour of the academy’s training facilities. He walked backward along an indoor running track, filming in selfie mode and breathing hard as he talked through his KCPD-branded mask.“Us police officers, we try to de-escalate using the best de-escalation tactics, which you will learn at the police academy,” Whitelaw said, walking up to a punching bag. “But, you know, life is very unpredictable.” He lightly punched it three times, then walked over to a life-size, silver, rubber figure with red shapes marking its chest, stomach, crotch, and knees. This dummy, named “Numb John,” is for baton training, he explained.Next, we walked downstairs, past large cardboard printouts of a white, bald man with a goatee in a fighting position. He was covered in hundreds of tiny holes on his back, stomach, and crotch (stun gun practice, Whitelaw remarked). Then we entered the hand-to-hand combat training room. The room looked like a karate dōjō. On one wall hung a “thin blue line” American flag, and on another hung two black-and-white pictures of officers putting people in, apparently, chokeholds. Between them was a banner reading “‘Come to the Party People’ - Jim Lindell.” Advertisement  
 


(Lindell invented a controversial alternative to chokeholds, which the KCPD has argued is less dangerous despite repeated calls from local organizers to ban the use of the restraint, though the department has refused.)We entered the exam room. Most of the 22 people applying to join the police academy had already taken their seats. The majority were white and male.The officers allowed me to take a quick poll of the applicants. I asked if anyone had watched Whitelaw’s videos for the KCPD, and four people raised their hands. I asked if anyone regularly watched YouTube videos from other police departments or about policing, and eight of the applicants raised their hands — all men, mostly white.“I spend a lot of time on YouTube watching videos about what it’s like” to be a police officer, Jay Humfeld, 42, told me. He’d been thinking about becoming a cop for a while, but watching Whitelaw’s videos — as well as Live PD and other police content fed to him by YouTube and Facebook’s algorithms — helped push him to actually apply. Advertisement  Once YouTube’s algorithm learns you’re interested in this genre, it’ll take you from officers in Houston using a heat-tech drone to find a fugitive hiding in a sewer system to a montage of police dogs in the Kansas City K-9 unit opening car doors with their snouts to a trans officer in Seattle standing in front of a skyline and telling her story. They’re largely a behind-the-scenes look at the job — the action, glamor, humor, and camaraderie. But they all share a message: We are the good cops.Two of the other applicants, a 28-year-old named Juan and a 22-year-old who asked me not to use his name, both of whom have military backgrounds, said they’d also watched Live PD and Cops, as well as videos from the KCPD and other police departments. They said YouTube fed them both kinds of videos interchangeably. The 22-year-old said he used to watch the Miami Police Department videos and thought they were “kinda cool.”“Police departments are making videos about what they do every day, and the different kinds of police officers like SWAT and vice, just everybody, it’s cool to learn about,” he said. He added that the main reason he was applying was that his uncle had just retired from the KCPD the week before.Juan estimated that he watches about 30 to 40 minutes of these videos a week unless he gets in a “scroll hole” and loses track of time. Entering the police force is a common career move for people with a military background, he said, but the videos also helped him understand what police work was really like, they made him feel like he could actually do the job. Advertisement  “That and also, I feel like there’s this negative connotation to police work, and the way people see it,” Juan added. “I just want to be the best person that I could, and help the community.”
 


In posting dozens, or hundreds, of hours of content on a regular schedule, police departments are essentially turning themselves into multimedia publishing platforms. They use Twitter to break the news, Facebook Live to give press conferences, Nextdoor to track and respond to neighborhood issues, Instagram to defuse tension with positive counterprogramming, TikTok to reach Gen Z, and long YouTube videos to provide ongoing entertainment and “education.”Nick Perez, a current police officer who started and starred in the hyper-popular Miami Police Department YouTube channel, told me that when his unit began the channel, they were seeing a lot of outrage over police violence online. Advertisement     “Back in 2015. It was a very anti-police atmosphere that was going around social media and there was no real pro-police side, nobody speaking on behalf of the police departments,” Perez said. The result, he said, was, “OK now here’s the police side, but we were doing it to reach out to our community as the Miami police department. However, we kind of took on the role of the pro-police content that was coming out.”Other police agencies caught on, he said, and suddenly, “with the idea of reaching our community, we kind of reached the world.”“The news was running stories about police whatever, what was happening with police in a negative light, but all we were doing was showing what we were doing,” Perez said later. “Which in turn made [people say], ‘let’s share their positive story.’ [There was] a lot of anti-police rhetoric, and we were the positive story coming out around that time.”Perez’s YouTube videos have also significantly boosted recruitment for the department, he told me, highlighting a recruitment video they recently posted that resulted, he said, in 1,000 new job applications in 12 hours.The massive protests that erupted after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, were the catalyst for not just Black Lives Matter but for police departments to realize they needed to embrace these new methods if they wanted to be heard, Stevens, the founder of SMILE, said.“Ferguson was a huge, huge, huge event, Charlottesville was huge, Baltimore, all of them were big in the whole social media policing [uptick]. But Ferguson was a real peak in police social media,” said Stevens. Advertisement     “The Ferguson Police Department were doing zero with social media when the whole ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’ situation went down,” Stevens said. “Now they’re very much in support of using social media and understand that they have to use social media, because they get how social media was their undoing that day.”One former police officer — who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize his new career — worked in police media outreach in a liberal city for years, but left the force in part due to the systematic problems exposed by the Black Lives Matter movement. He said that he faced a lot of debates in his department over how to use social media, particularly video platforms.“OK, so I’ve learned more about this wonderful human driving a patrol car and responding to tough calls,” he said. “But I’ve got a problem with the person who stopped me last week and was very dismissive and rude, or called my friend a racial slur, or refused to give me their name and badge number.”If there is no clear way to file a complaint about that other person or to successfully hold them accountable — which there very often is not — then showing examples of positive policing without any means of accountability is creating a false narrative, he said.“It’s a really fine line if you’re only doing one and not doing the other,” the former officer said. “Then that — that borders on propaganda.” Advertisement     Kansas City illustrates the problem. In order to file a complaint against a KCPD officer, citizens have to contact the Office of Community Complaints, “a non-police, civilian oversight agency.” However, the site makes clear, if the office deems the complaint worthy of an investigation, it hands that complaint over to the department’s Internal Affairs Unit. According to KCPD’s Office of Community Complaints, of 1,059 complaints in Kansas City between 2016 and 2019 against police officers, 246 investigations were completed, and only around 12% ruled in favor of civilians, the OCC said in a statement. The Police Scorecard, a public database tracking police accountability nationwide, found that of the 132 use-of-force complaints during that time, 0% ruled in favor of civilians. KCPD’s OCC said in a statement that “most of the force investigations either do not present enough information for the OCC to make a determination or the evidence proves conclusively that there was no violation of policy or procedure,” and added that in cases where the office does not rule in favor of the complainant, they may still take “corrective action” like training or policy reviews.The KCPD has, though, recently been held accountable in the court system. In November, an officer was found guilty of killing Cameron Lamb in his home during an erratic driving investigation. The trial was reportedly the first for a KCPD officer accused of killing someone in the line of duty since 1942.The videos also raise other questions of accountability. Robin Andersen, a professor of media studies at Fordham University who has studied media treatment of police and the military for decades, observed that the officers in these videos often deal with people with mental illnesses, sending them off to hospitals and emergency rooms instead of arresting them.Replacing police with mental health professionals has been one of the major demands of police reform activists. And since last summer’s protests, several cities around the country have attempted to oblige, rolling out pilot programs that send specialists instead of police to behavioral health calls. According to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by police, almost a quarter of the people shot and killed by police since 2015 have mental illnesses. Advertisement     The results from the first three months of New York’s version of this program were promising, and New York expanded the program in November. More people called for and received help than they do from 911 calls, New York 1 reported, and fewer people were transported to the hospital (which often does very little for a patient and leaves them with exorbitant medical debt). In June, the KCPD started requiring all of its officers to take a 16-hour “Intro to Crisis Intervention” course (though, KCPD noted, 55% of its officers have taken the full 40-hour course), and the department has one, five-person squad called the Crisis Intervention Team. It specifically responds to mental health calls but is composed of police officers. The department does not currently have plans to replace officers with civilian mental health specialists, KCPD said.“It is so clear, the reason these videos exist is to block and attempt to affect the public’s demand for police reform,” Andersen said. “They’re saying, ‘We don’t really need this. We are really nice guys already doing really good work and helping people.’ But we know that is, in reality, not the case.”In a statement responding to Andersen’s analysis, KCPD’s public information officer, Jake Becchina, disagreed. “Our department is constantly striving to be a better version of itself. We don’t always get it right, but we try to make improvements,” Becchina wrote. “We would never say that we are perfect and reform/improvements/change (however you would like to say it) are not needed. As such providing videos to try to prove that reform isn’t needed would be counterproductive to our mission.”
 


Outside of the Kansas City Police headquarters, statues memorializing fallen officers were wrapped in cellophane since the protests. All year, people protesting police brutality had been graffitiing them with “BLM” and “No Justice No Peace,” so the city covered them up. One statue, not wrapped, was a metal sculpture of a man plugging his own ears, his shoe in his mouth, and his tie around his eyes. It sat directly in front of one of the entrances to the building. The sign next to it read “Communications.”Inside, cubicles are covered in children’s drawings, bobbleheads, plants, and family photos. An indoor putting mat stretches between the desks, leading to a conference table and a whiteboard with the words “Twitter is not real life” written above plans for the team’s social media strategy.Pro-police paraphernalia faces Whitelaw’s desk from almost every direction: a pegboard sign reading “Blue Lives Matter KCPD,” the “thin blue line” flag on a large wooden police badge, a shelf designed like the American flag holding police badges in each stripe. Whitelaw’s boss, Jake Becchina, wears a ""thin blue line"" dog tag with a prayer on the back around his neck.“I don’t have any Blue Lives Matter stuff,” he said flatly when I asked him about it when we were away from the office. “It ain’t my cup of tea. And that’s all I’m gonna say about that.” Advertisement     The day after shooting the video at the academy, Whitelaw sat in his cubicle, preparing to edit the new footage and to add captions and a soundtrack. He wanted to get it out as soon as he could, so the next academy class would have even more applicants. His colleagues were sitting at the conference table, explaining to the least online among them what an influencer was. One of them called Whitelaw an influencer, and he chuckled.
 


“What if you are, though?” I asked, sitting behind him. “We’ve had a lot of discussions about how you don’t consider this job your identity. But if these videos get more popular, and you’re kind of the face of the department, how do you feel you’re going to reconcile those things?”“I’ve kind of, like, feathered the idea, if that makes any sense,” he said. “Because outside of this world, I’m just me. I wouldn’t want to, you know, confuse the two. I love the department. I love the community. But like, am I going to be running around being, like, Officer Whitelaw everywhere I go?” Advertisement     I pointed out that he said people were already starting to recognize him on the street.“You’re asking me something that I haven’t necessarily thought about,” he said. “So your question is, what does it look like when I’m out there in the world, and I’m not just a random Black dude, even not in uniform, walking around in the streets? But now I am Officer Whitelaw from YouTube. That’s how people recognize me.”He took a deep breath and thought about it more, talking through the question aloud until he came to a conclusion.“If you have to be the face of something, at least it’s being the face for the right reasons, or good reasons, things that are positive,” he said, and started chuckling again.“Because there will be a face of the department some other way, so it might as well be me.” ●

The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a Biden administration rule that required US companies with 100 employees or more to mandate that their staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing.But the court also narrowly upheld a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive federal funding.By blocking the mandate for private companies, which would have covered more than 84 million workers, the court dealt a significant blow to the White House's efforts to curtail the pandemic at a time when hospitalizations have surged nationwide due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Advertisement     ""I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.In an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, six members of the court granted a request from the National Federation of Independent Business to prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from enforcing the private employer rule for now.The majority of justices said the NFIB was likely to succeed in court by arguing Biden's labor secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate.They said the law that established OSHA ""empowers the Secretary to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.""""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,"" the court said. ""Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category.""The court's three liberal members — justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan — said in a dissenting opinion that they would have allowed the mandate to be enforced, calling COVID-19 a ""menace in work settings.""They accused their colleagues on the court — ""elected by, and accountable to, no one"" — of acting inappropriately as workplace health and safety experts.""In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed,"" the liberal justices wrote. ""As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible."" Advertisement     But in a separate decision in which Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals, the court decided 5–4 that the secretary of health and human services was authorized under existing law to require facilities to ensure their staffs are vaccinated against COVID (unless exempt for religious or medical reasons) in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.""After all,"" they wrote, ""ensuring that providers take steps to avoidtransmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm.""The decision will affect 10.4 million healthcare workers at some 76,000 medical facilities.Four of the court's most conservative members — justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett — said they would not have allowed that rule to go forward.Republicans cheered the court for blocking the private sector mandate, calling it an unnecessary imposition on businesses.""President Biden’s private sector vaccine mandate was always unwarranted and overbearing,"" Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi wrote on Twitter. ""I am glad that the Supreme Court has curbed runaway executive overreach and ensured that individual liberty does not become a casualty of this pandemic.""But public health workers and scientists said the decision was deeply disappointing.""As a physician and public health person I find this ruling very disappointing,"" said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. ""So many Americans have been poisoned with vaccine misinformation. Mandates work to protect them and those around them. This ruling will mean more suffering, more deaths, and more overwhelmed hospitals."" Advertisement     In his statement, Biden credited his vaccine mandates with reducing the number of unvaccinated Americans from 90 million to under 35 million.He called on business leaders to still institute their own vaccine requirements for employees in order to protect staff and customers.""The Court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure,"" Biden said, ""but that does not stop me from using my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans’ health and economy.""Like many Americans, the Supreme Court justices worked remotely and online during a long stretch of the pandemic. All nine members have since been vaccinated and received a booster shot, according to a court spokesperson.

The last seven years on Earth have been the hottest on record with no signs of slowing down, and 2021 ranked the sixth warmest ever, climate researchers at NOAA and NASA announced on Thursday.This is what climate change caused by human activity looks like, and there’s no end in sight.“We’re already seeing the impacts of the global warming that we’re talking about now in local weather and in extreme [weather events],” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, at a press conference. “We can detect the contribution of human warming on things like the heat waves in the Pacific Northwest, the intense precipitation that accompanied Hurricane Ida, or the floods in Germany and China.” Advertisement     A similar analysis from European scientists released this week also found the last seven years were the hottest on record, although their specific rankings by year differed slightly. According to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2021 was the fifth warmest on record.Last year was an especially deadly and expensive year for climate and weather disasters in the US. Texas saw unmatched freezing temperatures last winter, the Pacific Northwest experienced deadly heat waves, and the South and Midwest faced massive tornadoes, among many other extreme weather events in 2021.The researchers noted that a climate pattern known as La Niña helped to slightly cool parts of the Pacific Ocean in 2021, which may continue into this year. However, the average temperatures in the last seven years have all leaped over previous decades’ records.“It’s clear that each of the past four decades have been warmer than the one that preceded it,” Russell Vose, chief of the analysis and synthesis branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, told reporters. “And it’s been a steady increase in temperature since at least the 1960s.”Climate researchers expect the years ahead to follow this pattern and predict we will reach an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 2030s or early 2040s. However, regardless of when the globe reaches that temperature, scientists point out that global warming data is no longer just data but is playing out in real life. Advertisement     The planet has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius compared to 1880s levels. Time is quickly running out to limit warming another half degree, which is the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Frustration about the lack of action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions came to a head at November’s 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which left many climate activists and developing countries unsatisfied with minimal progress from larger countries.“Temperatures will keep rising as long as we keep increasing greenhouse gases,” Schmidt said.That means 2022 will probably be another hot one, filled with more dangerous disasters.“We can predict with some confidence that we will see more and more extreme heat waves, more intense rainfall, and more coastal flooding,” Schmidt said. “It may not be the Pacific Northwest next year, but it will be somewhere and we will obviously have to be prepared.”Just this week, South America and Australia are facing blistering heat waves. Western Australia’s Onslow today hit 123.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50.7 degrees Celsius, matching a record-high temperature for the region set back in 1962, the BBC reported. And earlier this week, Buenos Aires reached 106 degrees (or 41.1 degrees Celsius), according to AccuWeather, making it the second-highest temperature recorded there in more than a century.“There’s probably a 99% chance that 2022 will rank in the top 10 hottest years,” Vose said.

Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy, the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago.Rhodes, 56, was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm, Texas, about 35 miles north of Dallas. A second man, Edward Vallejo, 63, was arrested in Phoenix, according to the Department of Justice. The other nine defendants have all previously been charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy case pending in Washington, DC, federal court. Advertisement     According to the indictment, which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day, Rhodes conspired “to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power” by stopping Congress’s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6.He and the other defendants, prosecutors claim, “coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes’s call to take up arms at Rhodes’s direction.”Attorney Jonathan Moseley, who represents another member of the Oath Keepers, said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group's founder to come outside so he could be arrested. Kellye SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ general counsel, said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes. She called the arrest “all part of the show” and said he did not have enough funds to hire representation.In the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, at the time, Michael Sherwin, announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6, including seditious conspiracy. Advertisement     But although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6, a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing Congress’s attempts to certify the Electoral College, none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition — which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government.The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. It’s a rarely charged offense. Federal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group, and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later.Rhodes, whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name, founded the Oath Keepers in 2009. Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound, he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law. He worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events, including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law enforcement in southern Nevada known as the Bundy standoff.Rhodes, originally from Nevada, lived for years in Montana, but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life. He settled most recently in Granbury, Texas, where SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ attorney, is based. A longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle, Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election, casting doubt on the results of the election and calling on members of the Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6. Advertisement     The original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants. In the process, it has danced around Rhodes' involvement in their activities, referring to him as ""Person One"" in court filings. Nine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment.According to the 48-page, 17-count indictment, Rhodes began preparations for an apparent rebellion on Nov. 5, 2020, just two days after the presidential election, when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal. “We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes wrote at the time. “Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit.”Over the following weeks and months, prosecutors allege, he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group's members to prepare for conflict and, ultimately, to travel to Washington. “It will be a bloody and desperate fight,” he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11. “We are going to have to fight. That can’t be avoided.”Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2, Rhodes bought some $12,000 worth of firearms and accessories, including a shotgun, night vision goggles, and large amounts of ammunition, the indictment alleges. On Jan. 3, he departed Granbury, Texas, for Washington, stopping twice en route to spend an additional $10,500 on an AR-15 platform rifle, scopes, more ammo, and other accessories. And in the two weeks after Jan. 6, he spent an additional $17,500 on such items. Advertisement     It’s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington. The indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force, or QRF, composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington, Virginia.One of those individuals, according to the indictment, was Vallejo, a member of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described “activist” who served as an alternative delegate for the state’s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention. In a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4, he referred to the Comfort Inn as the “allied encampment.” Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6, he discussed the possibility of “guerilla war,” noting “there are people who are prepared, have the will, have the facilities to do more than taunt.”Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol, prosecutors now say he entered “restricted grounds” on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed, and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex. Amid the chaos, Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police.“Nope. I’m right here,” Rhodes responded. “These are Patriots.”Later that night, the charging document claims, Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating the day’s events at a restaurant in Vienna, Virginia. Amid the festivities, he sent out an encrypted message: “Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what’s coming.” Advertisement     Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in, it’s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence. Federal agents seized Rhodes’ phone last May, and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July. In September, the government also used a search warrant to seize attorney SoRelle’s phone. That warrant identified “seditious conspiracy” as a possible crime being investigated.Meanwhile, four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, presumably sharing their phones with investigators. Although little has been heard from those people, last month, prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government.The new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases. The original case, which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress’s activities but not seditious conspiracy, is slimmed down to seven defendants.Rhodes, meanwhile, faces the sedition-related charge, along with the other conspiracy count, alongside Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Joshua James, Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel, Brian Ulrich, and Thomas Caldwell. Rhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6.Prosecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant, Jonathan Walden, who is charged with obstructing Congress and illegally being at the Capitol, but he does not face any conspiracy allegation. Advertisement     It was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court’s schedule. Shortly before the holidays, US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out. The judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April, with a possible second trial in July. It now seems likely that the first trial date will no longer be at play.Unlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far, which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day — such as assaulting police, disrupting Congress’s certification of the election results, and simply illegally being in the Capitol — sedition deals with a person’s intent to go against the US government.The felony offense makes it a crime to “conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.”In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack, Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn’t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection. “The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,” he said, “whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.”The Oath Keepers, along with the Proud Boys, have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6. In November, the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition, citing “credible evidence of” his involvement in the Capitol insurrection. Advertisement     According to Moseley, Rhodes was scheduled to appear before the committee on Feb. 2. The attorney represents Kelly Meggs, one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy, and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case. At the time the FBI called on Thursday, Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee’s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment, the lawyer said. It took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside, he added, because he was not yet dressed at the time.“I am incredibly relieved,” said Tasha Adams, who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018, claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children. “I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying. The weight of constant fear, of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe.”

Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

Many routine court hearings in Chicago, and elsewhere across the country, are now conducted on video due to COVID-19.“Oh, wait,” Raines said. “Media streaming live on YouTube? What’s up with this?” The recording then stops.Bonjean told BuzzFeed News she was unaware of the video recording until receiving an anonymous tip several hours after the hearing. Raines recused himself from the case Wednesday after Bonjean filed an emergency motion to preserve the video. The case has since been reassigned to another judge. A video of the livesteam is no longer publicly available but BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the transcript of the comments. Advertisement     The recording, Bonjean said, “shows what some of us already know: That there's this chumminess that goes on behind closed doors and makes you wonder whether cases are being heard on the merits or for some other reason.”Bonjean appeared virtually before Raines on behalf of a Chicago man who claims police framed him for a murder he did not commit. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published an investigation showing that the man, Roosevelt Myles, had waited for 16 years for a court-ordered hearing to reevaluate his conviction.Myles, 57, served 28 years before completing his sentence in 2020. He is still awaiting a reexamination of his case that the courts had ordered four decades ago.Attorneys at Tuesday’s hearing discussed footage from an investigative television series, Reasonable Doubt, that profiled Myles’ case and determined that he was likely innocent of the 1992 murder for which he was convicted. Bonjean told Raines she had no objection to the prosecution collecting video from the television show but claimed the prosecutor, Todd Dombrowski, lied in a motion to obtain the video. Dombrowski denied the charge in front of the judge. He was not on the livestream when Raines made his derisive comments.In a court filing, Bonjean characterized Bucaro's comment as anti-gay. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Bucaro said that the comment had nothing to do with sexual orientation and was a hypothetical reference to having an extra-marital affair. Advertisement     Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who oversees the prosecutors mocking Bonjean, issued an immediate apology to the attorney.“I assure you that this behavior is unacceptable and runs counter to the values of this administration,” Foxx wrote, calling the prosecutors’ comments “unprofessional.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Foxx’s office reiterated her disappointment.“Their actions reflect poorly on the work of our office and the entire criminal justice system,” the statement reads, noting that Foxx had spoken directly with both prosecutors and “as a personnel matter, this will be addressed appropriately.”A spokesperson for Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans’ office said judges cannot comment on pending cases.Raines won a 2014 election for his seat on the bench after a career in private practice, as a prosecutor, and as a police officer. Voters elected to retain him in 2020. That same year the Chicago Bar Association rated him “qualified.”Bonjean said the Raines video underscores a structural problem within the Cook County criminal court system, the country’s second largest. Prosecutors and public defenders are assigned to handle cases in front of one judge. That, she said, encourages both prosecutors and public defenders to try to curry favor with the judge for the sake of their clients or careers. Bonjean said that power differential may have been a factor in the attorneys’ decisions to join Raines in criticizing her.Meanwhile, Myles, whose fate is at the heart of the case that Raines once presided over, sat silently in a collared shirt and navy blue sweater on the livestream. After learning of the judge’s comments, he expressed doubts about ever having the opportunity to clear his name.“This just shows what we’re up against,” he said.

32,The incident reportedly occurred after a fan asked Ye for an autograph.,"


Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections. Advertisement     “I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said. Advertisement     Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down. Advertisement     “Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live. Advertisement     The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.”Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing. Advertisement     When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

Prince Andrew's honorary military appointments and royal patronages have been removed by the Queen, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Thursday.The Palace said that Andrew, 61, stepped down from his patronages — the 66 charities of which he was the royal patron, according to the royal family's official website — ""with the Queen's approval and agreement."" Advertisement     Thursday's statement came one day after a New York federal judge declined to dismiss a civil sexual assault case against the Duke of York.""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending the case as a private citizen,"" reads the Buckingham Palace statement released via social media.Virginia Giuffre, 38, alleges that Andrew — a longtime friend and travel companion of disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in federal prison in while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges — sexually abused her on three occasions between 2000 and 2002 while she was under the age of 18. Giuffre has accused the Duke of York in court documents and interviews of sexually assaulting her in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands despite knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim.Andrew has denied Giuffre's claims.On Aug. 9, 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a short-term law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period. Advertisement     Although Andrew and his lawyers fought to have the case thrown out, a New York federal judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss the lawsuit, which will go to trial unless it is settled out of court.
 


Giuffre first accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a defamation case against Epstein and his former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, in December 2014. Giuffre's claims became known to the public when that document and other records from this case were unsealed in 2019.Soon after the documents came out, Andrew issued a statement saying that he did not “see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein's] arrest and conviction."" He also admitted that he had made a mistake by maintaining the friendship after Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida and served 13 months in jail.“I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know,"" he said. ""I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,” Advertisement     The Duke of York addressed his friendship with Epstein and strongly denied Giuffre's claims in a disastrous BBC interview that aired Nov. 16, 2019, and caused such a public outcry that Andrew resigned from public duties mere days after it aired.In it, he denied ever meeting Giuffre — despite a now-infamous picture that shows the duke with his arm around the then-17-year-old's waist. He said that her story of dancing with him at a club was false, because she described him as being sweaty and he has a medical condition that prevents him from sweating. Andrew also said that on one of the nights Giuffre said he was with her, he was at a Pizza Express with his daughter Beatrice.
 


On Nov. 20, 2019, Buckingham Palace issued a statement from the Duke of York in which he said he was stepping back from public duties ""for the foreseeable future."" Advertisement     ""It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support,"" he said.He has not performed any public duties in more than two years, but until Thursday, his honorary military titles and patronages were ""in abeyance"" (i.e., suspended) and he was still nominally associated with them.

Under the legal arrangement, which had been in effect since 2008, Britney's father and lawyers controlled her life and finances. The conservatorship was terminated in November last year after a protracted legal battle.
 


BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.


 


“When [the conservatorship] was put into place I was a 17-year-old. I was about to have a baby, so I didn’t understand what was happening,” she said. “Nor was I focused on that. I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby. I understand just as little about it then as I do now.” Advertisement     
 


“There was a time where my sister asked me — of her trust and will — if I would be the person who was sure that her boys got what they needed,” she said.“Once I realized that ... she’s in a conservatorship, I felt like I just didn’t want to be a part of [it] until maybe she was out of the conservatorship,” she said.“There was no me overseeing funds or something like that, and if that was, it was a misunderstanding,” she said. “Either way, I took no steps to be a part of it.”
 


“I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship, and just end this all for our family,” she said. “If it’s gonna cause this much discord, why continue it?”She added, “If she wanted to talk to other people … I set that up. I even spoke to her legal team … previous legal team, and that did not end well in my favor.”
 


“I actually teared up watching this. I’m so so so sorry for Britney that after all they have done her family continues… gaslighting and [sponging] off of her,” another tweet said.
 


What’s more, Justin notoriously made disrespectful comments about Britney in a series of interviews over the course of their breakup. For example, he made crude remarks about their sex life while speaking with Hot 97, saying, “I did it. I'm dirty,” when asked if he’d had “oral intercourse” with her.
 


“This. This. This,” one person replied in agreement.
 


“I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed,” he noted.

As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

On a balmy day in March, a container ship called the One Munchen docked in Savannah, Georgia. On board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of “peached cotton,” a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit. Embroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo.Now on sale for $82, the shirts feature a slim fit, an embroidered placket, and a promise: Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China’s Xinjiang region, where forced labor is rampant. But these button-downs — along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, and other clothing brands — were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group. And that’s a red flag.
 


Forced labor is so pervasive in China's far west region of Xinjiang — and government control over information is so absolute — that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there. But here’s what is known:Esquel Group gins and spins cotton in Xinjiang.In July 2020, the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries, Changji Esquel Textile Co., citing concerns over forced labor.In January 2021, US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US, again citing forced labor.Since the cotton ban, a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong — hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang — has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US. But procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel’s Guangdong branch works together with its Xinjiang-based cotton spinning factories. When asked repeatedly, neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from.Esquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation. The company describes itself as “vertically integrated,” meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain: Esquel’s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds, and those fibers are later spun into yarn in Esquel’s spinning mills. Esquel’s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth, then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong–based Esquel Enterprises. The company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang, where the bulk of China’s cotton is grown — but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region.Since the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January, at least 16 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, trade records show, the latest one in mid-December. One shipment has arrived addressed to PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, containing Tommy Hilfiger–branded goods; four for Ralph Lauren; and one for Polo, a Ralph Lauren subsidiary. Guangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list. PVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list, as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, but in late December — after BuzzFeed News reached out for comment — PVH released an updated version of its list, and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it. No Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren’s latest list, which was published in November.Hugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel, and the company had replied that “all our specifications and standards, including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions, have been and are being complied with.” Hugo Boss also said its own audits at Esquel production facilities revealed no evidence of the use of forced labor.PVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor. It added that it follows all national import and export laws, and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions.Asked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang, Esquel did not give any specifics, saying only that it sources from “most of the key cotton producing countries globally.”The Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable.“Cotton is grown in Xinjiang, but then it is sold to warehouses, processors, and suppliers all over China,” said Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang. And then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and fabric to the rest of the world. “Every time it moves, its provenance is increasingly obscured. There are many ways to track it, but so far most companies don’t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.”A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law, importers must take “reasonable care” in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor. Asked what constitutes “reasonable care,” the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to “become familiar with applicable laws and regulations” and work with the agency to protect consumers from “harmful and counterfeit imports.”As part of its campaign targeting Muslims, the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories. The US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government, including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time: The US banned cotton and tomato imports from the region in January 2021, but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor, placing the burden of proof on importers.The region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies. China is currently the world’s leading producer of cotton, with over 87% of that coming from Xinjiang. Research shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.The Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China, with the Chinese government, along with Chinese consumers and celebrities, pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support.Human rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced. They say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups, underpinned by government programs, is so widespread in Xinjiang that it’s nearly impossible for any companies that source there to ensure their suppliers don’t use it. The political sensitivity of the issue, combined with the government’s other repressive measures targeting minority groups, has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains.The Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains, stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020, citing “an increasingly untenable operating environment.” Five firms did the same.Esquel is the world’s largest maker of woven cotton shirts, providing major brands with more than 100 million every year, earning the company more than $1.3 billion in yearly revenue. Esquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills, where cotton is spun into yarn. BuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong, matching images of these facilities on Esquel’s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations. The book Esquel produced to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary describes how its spinning mill in Xinjiang’s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories. By 2018, the book adds, Esquel’s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $100 million, including charitable donations. The company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed.
 


Esquel has said publicly that it uses long-staple cotton, which is prized in the industry for its durability and luxe feel. About a fifth of the world’s long-staple cotton is produced in Xinjiang’s Aksu prefecture, and according to the company’s website, Esquel has two subsidiaries based in Aksu: Akesu Esquel Agricultural Development Company Ltd. and Akesu Esquel Cotton Industrial Company Ltd. Esquel’s own literature describes Awati County in Aksu as the “Home of China’s ELS Cotton,” referring to extra-long-staple cotton, and said it became “a major plantation site of Esquel’s quality cotton” starting in 2002. In addition to China, the company has cloth and garment production facilities in Vietnam and Sri Lanka.Hugo Boss is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative and says that 86% of its purchased cotton is “sustainable,” citing environmental standards as well as “socio-economic factors.”
 


In July 2020, following a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Uyghur forced labor, the US announced sanctions against 11 Chinese companies including Changji Esquel Textile, one of the five Esquel subsidiaries based in Xinjiang. The sanctions announcement described these companies as being “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” These sanctions made it difficult, but not impossible, for US brands to trade with the companies outright — but the reputational damage meant that brands were reluctant to be seen working with them.Nike, which the ASPI report had named as working with Changji Esquel, issued a statement denying any relationship to the company. Hugo Boss said that it was asking all of its suppliers whether they were using any products made in Xinjiang. (Esquel launched an appeal, saying that the company “does not use forced labor” and “never will use forced labor.” But in October, a federal judge refused to lift trade curbs on the company.)The January 2021 ban on all Xinjiang cotton added a further layer of restriction and put major clothing brands under a fresh spotlight. Hugo Boss posted conflicting promises about what it would do next.In Chinese, on the company’s official Weibo account, Hugo Boss said, “we will continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton … For many years, we have respected the one-China principle, resolutely defending national sovereign and territorial integrity.” Around the same time, the company said in an English-language statement that it had “not procured any goods in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers.” Advertisement  Hugo Boss later walked the Chinese language statement back, saying it had not been authorized. That led Chinese celebrities to cancel deals with the brand as part of a pressure campaign to keep it from backing down.With the Xinjiang bans in force, Esquel continued to export clothes through its other subsidiaries based in Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Trade records on the Panjiva platform, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, show 36 Esquel Enterprises shipments have arrived at US ports since the introduction of sanctions, including Seattle; Savannah, Georgia; Newark, New Jersey; New York; Los Angeles; Long Beach, California; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; and Boston. According to the trade records, their combined value was $1,473,490. Hugo Boss’s most recent shipment arrived at the Port of Seattle on Dec. 18, bound for Hugo Boss Canada.Sixteen of those shipments went to Hugo Boss. BuzzFeed News was able to identify 30 different clothing products from these shipments — including white button-down blouses branded as “organic cotton poplin.” BuzzFeed News then found these items being sold under the Hugo Boss brand both by the brand’s own website and by other retailers, including ModeSens and Amazon. ModeSens did not respond to a request for comment, and Amazon declined to comment.
 


BuzzFeed News matched items of clothing sold online with those described in shipping records using the eight-digit numerical “style codes” associated with them, which also appear on the websites where they are being sold. Hugo Boss also named three Esquel factories in Guangdong in its most recently published supplier list in May 2021.
 


A document seen by BuzzFeed News shows how Esquel’s Xinjiang branch works with its Guangdong operation. At the start of August, Xinjiang Esquel issued a joint tender with the Guangdong branch, requesting bids for the transport of cotton materials. The winner of the bid would go under contract with the two Esquel branches between Aug. 1, 2021, and Jan. 31 of this year, according to the document. The companies sought suppliers that had recently gone through qualification inspections that year.On Dec. 2, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights launched a criminal complaint in the Netherlands against Dutch apparel brands that source from Esquel companies among other Chinese suppliers with Xinjiang ties. The group argues that Esquel’s “vertically integrated” structure all but ensures that the cotton it gins in Xinjiang ends up with its other subsidiaries that export clothes to Western countries. “It is unacceptable that European governments criticize China for human rights violations while these companies possibly profit from the exploitation of the Uyghur population,” said Corina Ajder, a legal adviser at ECCHR. “It is high time that responsible corporate officers are investigated and — if necessary — held to account.” The group filed a similar complaint in France in April and in Germany in September. The German filing named Hugo Boss, along with other German-registered companies. Hugo Boss has said it rejects the claims made by ECCHR. Advertisement  Tommy Hilfiger’s owner, the American apparel giant PVH, also owns brands including Calvin Klein. PVH told the New York Times in July 2020 that it would end its relationships with fabric producers in Xinjiang, as well as cotton suppliers from the region, within a year.An examination of trade records shows that the Chinese Esquel factories exported at least 12 different styles of Tommy Hilfiger–branded clothing to the United States in February. Several of these items are still on sale on the brand’s website, albeit currently sold out.Matching the products’ style codes to Tommy Hilfiger products sold on its website shows they range from sweaters and pullovers to knit skirts and dresses. One cream-colored crewneck sweater, which bears the brand’s logo, is advertised as being made with “organic cotton,” as were other products. The clothing sells for between $68 and $150.●

The police officers who investigated a domestic dispute between Gabby Petito and her fiancé shortly before her death made several mistakes and should be placed on probation, according to an independent review released Wednesday.The report found that the two Moab police officers who contacted Petito and Brian Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021, after being alerted to a ""domestic problem"" failed to cite Petito for domestic violence, misinterpreted Utah's assault code, did not take photographs of her injuries, and neglected to contact the 911 caller who reported seeing Laundrie slap Petito, among other issues. The mistakes they made, however, were not intentional, and it's impossible to say what impact they may have had on her death, concluded Price City, Utah, police Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, who conducted the review. Advertisement     ""The officers did not know what they were doing was wrong at the time and did not make the decision to benefit themselves in any way,"" Ratcliffe wrote. ""They both believed at the time they were making the right decision based on the totality of the circumstances that were presented.""In addition to placing the officers on probation, Ratcliffe recommended that Eric Pratt and Daniel Robbins receive additional training on report writing and investigating domestic violence, as well as overall reviews of how the Moab Police Department approves reports and its requirements on gathering photographic evidence of injuries sustained by and offering medical assistance to all individuals involved in an incident. He also advised that Moab police follow up with the 911 caller that the officers failed to interview, despite the time that has passed since their report.In a statement, the city said it planned to implement the recommendations.""As the Moab City Police Department continues its daily mission to serve our community, efforts are underway to provide additional resources and tools to assist the[m] in addressing domestic violence incidents,"" the statement read. Advertisement     The disappearance and death of Petito, the 22-year-old aspiring social media influencer who went missing while documenting her #VanLife cross-country road trip with Laundrie on Instagram and YouTube, captivated the internet last year. After a coroner determined the cause of her death was strangulation, domestic violence survivors and advocates raised concerns about what they believed should have tipped off Moab police that Petito's life was in danger.""If this case was handled flawlessly, would it have changed anything?"" Ratcliffe wrote in his report. ""Nobody knows.""
 


In his report, Ratcliffe concluded that Petito was likely ""a long-term victim of domestic violence,"" but he suggested that officers could not have known that from the information they had at the time.He described the ways in which Laundrie tried to control Petito's movements and said that the act of grabbing Petito's face — which survivors told BuzzFeed News was a red flag for potential future strangulation — was probably ""his attempt to 'make' Gabby calm down or 'make' her shut up.""""Although the act of grabbing someone’s face, like in this case, rarely causes any significant injury, I find that the specific act of grabbing someone’s face is extremely personal, violent, and controlling,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Just because there may have been some signs that Brian was the long-term predominant aggressor, law enforcement could only act on the information they were provided."" Advertisement     Based on his review of the body-worn camera footage, incident reports, and interviews with Pratt, Robbins, and Assistant Moab Police Chief Braydon Palmer, Ratcliffe said Petito was determined to be ""the predominant aggressor"" in this incident. Petito told the officers that she and Laundrie had been arguing all morning; when she saw the sirens as police tried to pull them over, she hit Laundrie to get his attention, causing the car to swerve.Ratcliffe explained that her statements along with what Laundrie and another witness told police ""would lead the officers to believe that Brian was acting in self-defense."" However, he noted that officers failed to further investigate the complaint Petito made about Laundrie grabbing her face, causing a scratch on her cheek.The officers in this incident had probable cause to arrest Petito, according to the report. But they misinterpreted the state's statute on assault as requiring intent when that was not necessary. They also miscategorized the incident as ""disorderly conduct"" when it should have been recorded as a domestic violence incident, Ratcliffe said.""Despite knowing the history of those involved, we have had to make a decision based on the information presented to law enforcement at the time, despite our personal feelings and the known history of the relationship,"" he wrote.While it's clear the officers made several mistakes in their interactions with Petito and Laundrie, Ratcliffe concluded that it was unclear whether any of their missteps ultimately contributed to her death. Advertisement     ""Would Gabby be alive today if this case was handled differently? That is an impossible question to answer despite it being the answer many people want to know,"" he wrote. ""Nobody knows and nobody will ever know the answer to that question.""

Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense. Advertisement     “The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

The paradox of Omicron, now responsible for an estimated 98.3% of all US coronavirus cases, is that while it seems more likely to result in significantly milder outcomes than Delta and previous variants, the health system is as stressed as it’s ever been.Public health officials are warning that Omicron is threatening to overwhelm the medical infrastructure with sheer numbers, and hospitals are filled with seriously ill patients.“It's going to get worse before it gets better,” said Dean Blumberg, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the University of California, Davis.Here’s what we know about why this is happening:Omicron is more contagiousThe variant appears to be roughly two to five times more transmissible than Delta, which previously dominated US cases.“This is the second-most contagious disease in the world now, second to measles,” said Sara Murray, the director of the health informatics data science and innovation team and an associate professor of clinical and hospital medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Advertisement     “While we are seeing early evidence that Omicron is less severe than Delta and that those infected are less likely to require hospitalization, it's important to note that Omicron continues to be much more transmissible,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday.This means that even though a smaller percentage of patients infected with Omicron require hospitalization, the total number of COVID cases is so high that hospitals are seeing more of those patients than at any point in the pandemic.COVID-19 cases have reached record levels in the US, averaging around 1.4 million new reported cases a day, itself an undercount. Daily, an average of 19,800 people nationwide are now admitted to hospitals with COVID, according to the CDC, a 33% increase over the past week. Almost a third of intensive care unit beds nationwide are now filled with COVID patients, meaning roughly 1 out of every 2.5 people in an ICU ward in the country has the virus
 


More patients are being admitted “with” COVIDCOVID is so widespread right now that a significant percentage of hospitalized patients are admitted for something else but then test positive upon screening at admittance. Advertisement     “We test a lot of asymptomatic patients in preparation for procedures or surgeries, planned hospitalizations — and even in those folks who are totally asymptomatic, we're seeing a case positivity right now of about 12%,” Murray said.“It’s a very different landscape that we're seeing with overcrowding in the hospital than we've seen with the prior waves of COVID,” said Richelle Charles, an infectious disease expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “Almost half of these cases are in the hospital for non-COVID-related illnesses.”At UCSF, Murray said overall about two-thirds of their COVID patients were hospitalized for the disease, while one-third were hospitalized with it. In pediatric COVID patients, about half of them were admitted for something other than the disease.Yet even if these patients' COVID symptoms are mild or nonexistent, their positive status places an extra burden on the hospital because they require isolation and extra safety protocols for hospital staff.Staffing shortages from exposure and burnoutHidden in the increasing case numbers are doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel infected by the more contagious variant, which causes more breakthrough infections among the vaccinated than past ones, said Akin Demehin, the policy director at the American Hospital Association. Even with mild infections, those healthcare workers are still out of action for a week after their tests turn negative, per CDC policy, just as the surge fills up hospitals and drives up demand for staff.The Omicron surge will only put more stress on doctors and nurses, who still have to care for all those extra patients. One survey last August reported that nearly 60% of doctors feel burned out, Demehin said, and that was two surges ago. “We hear this from hospital leaders all the time — their number one, two, and three priority right now is workforce,” he said. “They know just how much has been asked of healthcare providers over the past almost two years.” Advertisement     More young children“This time around, we're seeing more children less than 5 years of age,” Blumberg said.He has observed that many of them have milder cases of bronchitis or croup, whereas the teens with COVID seen in earlier surges had more severe pneumonia. Most of these young children recover well, but he cautioned that with any infection and any hospital admission, “some children aren't going to do well.”Hospitalizations among young children are currently higher than they’ve ever been during the pandemic, according to the CDC.Vaccines still work, but boosters are importantOne thing the Omicron surge hasn’t altered is the well-established reality that vaccines significantly improve people's odds of not dying from COVID-19. Deaths are still on the increase, averaging 1,600 a day in the US, an increase of 40% from the past week, according to the CDC. (Walensky said at the White House briefing that she thinks most of those are Delta variant cases.)With Omicron rampant, “virtually everybody is going to wind up getting exposed and likely get infected,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday. “But if you're vaccinated, and if you're boosted, the chances of you getting sick are very, very low.”“At my hospital, we have a graphic that's sent out every day that has little people icons, those in the ICU, those on a ventilator, and those admitted for COVID. And the vast majority, overwhelmingly, are unvaccinated people in all three categories,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, who spoke Tuesday at an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing on Omicron for reporters. Advertisement     “What we've learned with Omicron is that the booster really makes a big difference in terms of reducing your risk,” Murray said. Her hospital is seeing both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID. But even patients who only had an initial series of vaccines — no booster — appear to be protected from the most severe outcomes.“What we aren't seeing is patients ending up on ventilators if they're fully vaccinated,” she said. “I don't have a single fully vaccinated patient in the hospital on a ventilator right now.”

41,Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break.,"


In Chicago, patients are being treated in hospital hallways and in office chairs.In Farmington, New Mexico, military reinforcements have been deployed in civilian hospitals from over 700 miles away in San Diego.And in Paterson, New Jersey, nonemergency surgeries have been canceled. A gallbladder condition that might typically require removal? Try antibiotics first. A bone fracture for which you might normally go under the knife? Let’s put you in a cast and crutches for a bit to see how you fare. Advertisement     “You don’t really have to invoke crisis standards of care to be delivering crisis standards of care,” said Anand Swaminathan, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Paterson’s St. Joseph's University Medical Center. “It’s an enormous challenge to render care to as many patients as we can right now.”This is America in the Omicron wave. US hospitals and their staff are currently being tested in new and challenging ways that are unlike previous surges in the pandemic, medical workers across the country told BuzzFeed News. Patients who might normally be admitted for observation are being sent home to keep beds available. Others are waiting 10 hours or more in emergency rooms to be seen, before perhaps giving up and walking out altogether.Reaching the breaking point is a deceptively slow process, but little by little Swaminathan said his hospital and others are losing the things they need to keep running effectively. “This collapse is not going to be like an armageddon. It’s not going to happen all at once,” he said. “It’s going to be fairly silent, and people aren’t going to realize it until they call 911 and no one comes.”As Omicron spreads, COVID cases are surging at record levels in all 50 states. But given the relative mildness of the variant for most people, especially the vaccinated, Anthony Fauci and others have said it is now more relevant to pay closer attention to hospitalization data than total case numbers. Yet, that too is alarming. More than 147,000 people are currently in US hospitals with COVID — more than at any point in the pandemic to date. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the seven-day average of hospital admissions had risen 33% over the prior week to about 19,800 per day.
 


Importantly, those figures include people with an incidental case of COVID, meaning they came to be treated for something else and were found to also be positive for the virus. But while that may sound less worrying, it can be deceiving. COVID may be exacerbating some people’s underlying health issues and, crucially, the net effect on hospitals is the same: more patients taking up more beds and requiring special isolation and safety protocols so as not to infect others.While new studies are showing Omicron is less severe and requires hospital stays about 70% shorter than Delta on average, the incredibly transmissible variant is still spreading like wildfire, including among children, who are being admitted to hospitals with COVID at record rates. “The risk of hospitalization remains low, especially among people who are up to date on their COVID vaccines,” Walensky said Wednesday. “However, the staggering rise in cases — over 1 million new cases each day — has led to a high number of total hospitalizations.”All this while more and more medical workers are themselves testing positive and being forced to the sidelines, leaving their colleagues — at least, those who haven’t left the profession altogether due to burnout — straining to treat the patients turning up in droves in their emergency rooms with COVID, yes, but also for any other medical condition or traumatic injury.The cruel irony, then, is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks toppling the US hospital system. Advertisement     “Before this if you had an acute life- or limb-threatening medical issue and you went to an emergency department in America, you would have a promise that it would be quickly taken care of,” said Gabe Gao, an ER physician at St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts. “I don’t think we can keep that promise right now.”
 


Not every hospital is currently facing a crunch. Some that previously experienced huge waves are holding steady — for now. “In the first wave, I had 400 patients with COVID, now we have 100,” said Aaron Glatt, chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island, New York. “We have better treatments, we have a better understanding of the virus, but at the same time, two months ago I had 10 patients with COVID.”Michael Daignault, an ER doctor at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, said he was so shaken by the surge of cases in his area last winter that he felt the current moment was more manageable. Before patients might stay for weeks or months at a time in the ICU, but now that tends to be different. “The majority of patients that are getting admitted have less severe illness. The average length of stay has gone down,” he said. “It’s a quicker turnover. We’re able to handle it.” Advertisement     But both Daignault and Glatt said they had still experienced staffing shortages, with hospital workers out sick from the virus. They also noted they live in states with relatively high vaccination rates. New York, for example, has almost 20% more people fully vaccinated than in Missouri, where total hospitalizations are now above their worst previous levels.“Missouri’s hospitals are slammed,” Missouri Hospital Association spokesperson Dave Dillon said. “Hospitals are delaying non-emergent care, boarding patients of all kinds in emergency departments for a lack of bed space, and experiencing significant workforce challenges.”“Not sure what else to tell you. These are very difficult times,” he said.In Idaho, the state with the lowest vaccination rate where less than half the population is fully vaccinated, the Omicron surge could be disastrous. Many hospitals there have only recently pulled themselves out of crisis standards of care following an overwhelming surge of Delta cases in September. Susie Keller, the CEO of the Idaho Medical Association, said her members have barely caught their breath from that trauma and are now staring down the likely prospect of another wave. “They just feel completely besieged,” she said. “It’s another thing on top of everything else.”Keller implored those in her state who have not received a vaccine to do so, lest they take up a hospital bed that could go to another person who has had their shots and comes to be treated for COVID or something else, only to discover medical assistance is in short supply. “It’s absolutely unfair, and it’s a very sad situation,” she said. “My heart truly goes out to those folks who are trying to do the right thing and for circumstances beyond their control end up in a hospital where the resources aren’t there.” Advertisement     
 


There are signs that some places hit early by Omicron have seen the worst of their spike in infections, although hospitalizations have previously tended to lag case counts by about two weeks.But other states are still yet to reach their Omicron peak, including Arizona, where in a press briefing on Tuesday, Marjorie Bessel, the chief clinical officer at the Phoenix-headquartered Banner Health, which employs over 50,000 people across the American West, pleaded with people to be patient with staff in the days and weeks ahead. More employees are calling out sick, she said, meaning patients are experiencing longer waits than normal.“We are busy in our clinics, we are busy in our urgent cares, we're busy in our emergency departments, and we are busy in our hospitals,” Bessel said. “We also understand that we are not yet at the peak of the Omicron variant.” Advertisement     In an effort to reduce the total number of medical staffers out sick at any one point, the CDC announced just before Christmas that asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days, instead of 10, if they test negative. Medical staff who have received their booster shots also now no longer need to self-quarantine at home following high-risk exposures.One ER physician in Manhattan, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about conditions at his hospital, said that this change in CDC policy had lessened nursing shortages at his facility, but he noted doctors were still often performing nursing tasks, such as administering IVs or discharging patients.“There are obviously concerns,” he added. “I think there’s still not great evidence about how long you’re contagious, and I think it’s a rule made out of understandable necessity because otherwise we wouldn’t have enough medical workers, but on an individual level it’s hard to reckon with the idea of coming back and potentially infecting other staff members.”Across the city in Brooklyn, another ER doctor not authorized to speak with the media said she too was having to take on more tasks usually carried out by nurses or patient care technicians, in addition to her own work. She’s only been a working doctor for a year and a half, but the staffing crunch has her feeling more overwhelmed than ever. “Sometimes it’s just so busy you don’t even have time to think or have emotions about what’s going on,” she said, “but after your shift ends, then it kind of hits you, this wave of exhaustion.”Gao, the Massachusetts doctor, said he’s noticed classic symptoms of burnout in himself and other colleagues. When he walks into work on a Monday morning and sees 35 or 40 admitted patients taking up beds in the emergency department and another 20 to 30 in the waiting room, he knows he’s in for yet another rough week. It takes a certain mental and physical resiliency to choose to work in the ER, but he worries he’s already been broken by it. Advertisement     “It’s terrible. It’s awful. It’s the moral injury of all this,” Gao said. “Healthcare should not function on the backs of beleaguered emergency workers that are trying to find the smallest nook and cranny to fit someone into, and that person’s healthcare should not be hanging by a thread as a result of those efforts.”Peter Aldhous and Dan Vergano contributed reporting to this story.

42,Omicron appears to be the mildest widespread COVID variant so far. Here's why it risks pushing the US hospital system to the brink.,"


The fire in a Bronx apartment building on Sunday was one of the city's deadliest in decades, leaving 17 people dead from smoke inhalation and devastating a close-knit community.As their identities were made public this week, so were their stories. Eight children were among those killed, and some families had multiple loved ones die. Officials said the victims were largely Gambian immigrants, some of whom worshipped at the same mosques and even emigrated from the same town. Advertisement     The two youngest victims were Ousmane Konteh, a 2-year-old boy, and Haouwa Mahamadou, a 5-year-old girl. Her brother, 12-year-old Seydou Toure, also perished. He had attended eighth grade next door at Angelo Patri Middle School, the New York Times reported. His classmates have been mourning the loss together, writing messages on a memorial poster, lighting prayer candles, and wearing badges with Seydou's photo.“I loved him dearly,” said the school's principal, Angel Ortega. “He always had that smile.""Two other siblings remained in critical condition, with organizers also setting up a GoFundMe for their recovery effort.Five of the victims were from the same family. They were Haja Dukureh, 37, her husband, Haji Dukuray, 49, and their three children, Mustapha, 12, Mariam, 11, and Fatoumata, 5, the woman's uncle told the New York Post. Advertisement     The uncle, whose name is also Haji Dukuray, said he had many relatives living in the building and would regularly drive there from his home in Delaware to visit. “We have faith, so we’re holding onto our faith,” Dukuray said. “We are hanging in there as much as we can. We’re supporting each other.”The couple emigrated from Gambia over a decade ago, and all three children were born in the US, another relative, 21-year-old Hawa Dukuray, told the New York Times. The mother worked as a home health aide, and the father at a fried chicken restaurant, saving money they hoped to send back to Gambia. Living high up on the 19th floor — and without an outdoor fire escape — the family tried taking the stairs to escape the burning building, but did not make it out in time, the relative said.The family, like many of the others whose loved ones died in the fire, has a GoFundMe page set up by a relative to help cover funerals and other costs.Another family lost four loved ones in the fire: Fatoumata Drammeh, 50, Foutmala Drammeh, 21, Nyumaaisha Drammeh, 19, and Muhammed Drammeh, 12.Ishak Drammeh, 57, was not home at the time of the fire that killed his wife and children. Foutmala had been studying international economics and was about to graduate college, he told the New York Times.“She was a very good girl,” he said. “Muhammad was a good boy too. Nyumaaisha was a good girl, she finished her high school; next month she is supposed to start her college.” Advertisement     Just one day before the fire, Muhammed had celebrated his 12th birthday at an indoor trampoline park. The last time Fatima, the surviving sister, saw her mother and one of her young sisters was in their apartment before her brother's party, she said.“I just said bye to them, because we were leaving the house,” she said. “I didn’t think it would be my last time seeing them.”Just one member of the family, 16-year-old Yagub, made it out of the fire alive. He ""was the only one rescued from the building and is currently being cared for in the hospital,"" according to a GoFundMe for the family set up by their cousin Nhuma Darame.
 


The Gambian Youth Organization (GYO), a Bronx-based nonprofit supporting young members of the community, has already more than quintupled their fundraising goal, raising more than $1 million on GoFundMe to aid the victims' families.One of the organization's volunteers, Sera Janneh, 27, also died in the fire. Despite working multiple jobs, she was highly involved in GYO, its founder Momodou Sawaneh told Gothamist, describing her as an “industrial woman"" who had ""such a great life in front of her."" Advertisement     “When I talk about her, tears come out from my eyes,” Sawaneh said. ""We lost her for something that could have been prevented.""Janneh had been studying to become a social worker at Lehman College because she believed “we needed more of that in our community, especially in the African community,” her sister Mareama Janneh, 31, told the New York Times. Her younger sister ""is currently intubated with hopes of recovering from her injuries,"" she wrote on the family's GoFundMe.Sera's best friend, Breanna Elleston, 27, said they had loved visiting museums and attending concerts together since they first met in high school.“Every milestone that I’ve ever had in my life, she’s always been there for me,” Elleston said. “Even if it was hard, she would drop everything and be there for me.”Not all the victims were residents of the building; Fatoumata Tunkara, 43, and her 6-year-old son, Omar Jambang, had been there to visit a friend. Tunkara leaves behind four children, according to a GoFundMe set up by a relative.Tunkara's eldest son, Abdullaie Chan, 19, told the New York Daily News he called his mother ""more than 40 times"" when he heard about the fire.“I knew she was in that building, but I thought she got out in time,” Chan said. “She didn’t pick up the phone... I feel like she was not supposed to be there.”Also among the deceased were Isatou Jabbie, 31, and Hagi Jawara, 47. They were the parents of four children, according to two GoFundMe pages.Hagi Jawara was from Sierra Leone and came to the US as a refugee in the 1990s, his brother, Yusupha Jawara, told the Associated Press. It was there that he met Isatou Jabbine, a Gambian woman living in the Bronx, who he later married. Advertisement     When Yusupha, who lives nearby, heard about the fire, he hurried there to help bring victims to the hospital. As the hours went by without the couple answering their phones, Yusupha grew increasingly worried. He later realized a man he'd seen on a gurney had been his brother.“I was just helping the EMS transport one person to the hospital when I saw him — somebody similar like him — on a stretcher being brought to the ER,” he said. “At that time, I didn’t have the focus to know that it was him.”

Mike Kamber has had many, many lives. The founder and executive director of the Bronx Documentary Center worked as a documentary photographer for over two decades, and his work has twice been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. He lived in the Bronx for a period in the 1980s and dreamed of making an educational space that would bring arts and education to the South Bronx. Founded in 2011, the Bronx Documentary Center is a nonprofit organization and mecca for photography lovers.We asked Kamber about the photographers and images that have influenced him over his lengthy career. One of the photographs that influenced him was taken by his friend Tim Hetherington, who died in Libya in 2011 and with whom he’d discussed starting a photo nonprofit. Kamber’s mother, also a photographer who lives in Maine, was one of his early inspirations.Here are just a few of the photographers and works that inspire Kamber.
 


I was born in 1963, and my first memories photographically are images from Vietnam. Larry Burrows was easily the greatest color photographer of that generation, and his photos were the ones that affected me first — I saw them in Life magazine. And Burrows’ photos of war are not heroic — no war photo should ever be heroic. Yet Burrows’ photo here of a wounded soldier reaching out to help another wounded soldier lying on the ground is biblical in scope and brilliant in composition. It gives you a sense of the quagmire that was the Vietnam War.Burrows was shooting Kodachrome with a Leica M4: no light meter, extremely difficult to get the light right, and no room for error. And yet Burrows’ use of light and color reminds me of Goya's paintings of war from hundreds of years earlier. To me, this is just an epic, sad, and futile photo of war — but also says something about brotherhood and sacrifice. Larry Burrows was killed alongside Henri Huet, another of my favorite photographers, when their helicopter was shot down in 1971. Advertisement  
 


My mother, Hannah Kamber, took this picture in 1969 at Pineland, a notorious facility for the developmentally disabled up in Maine, the state where I grew up. She worked briefly as a photographer for the Maine Times shooting in the 1960s and covering important social issues — or at least issues that were important to her. The Maine Times was an alternative newspaper — they were sprouting up across the country then and usually focused on investigations and providing a counterpoint to the mainstream press. And the Maine Times gave my mother freedom to go out and do what she wanted. She talked her way into Pineland somehow. As she told it, there was someone on the inside who wanted to see real change. And she photographed people chained to the floor in pools of urine, filthy and forgotten. The state of Maine started an investigation based on her photos and changed the laws regarding the treatment of our special needs population. This photo showed me that photojournalism could make a real difference in people’s lives.
 


This photo by Danny Lyon was from his Bikeriders series. Danny's photos were important to me because when he immersed himself, he went all the way. His photos from the civil rights movement were from the inside, not the outside. When he did his prison book, Conversations with the Dead, he spent months inside the prison, in the subblocks, and actually printed copies of the book clandestinely in the prison workshop. In this photo, he was in deep with the Chicago outlaws as a member of the motorcycle gang, and his photos show an intimacy that no visiting photographer can touch. Danny is also a master of composition and movement and light and knows when to leave space around a photograph. But I've learned a lot, looking at his photos. Him and Robert Frank. Of course, from Danny, I learned that you had to commit all the way, that you couldn't come in and do a toe touch for an hour or a day and then escape back to your comfortable life. If you're committed, you went all the way.
 


This photo is by my friend Tim Hetherington, who was killed in 2011, and his death pushed me to start the Bronx Documentary Center, which he really helped plan out. We talked about a nonprofit like this for a couple of years. And when Tim was killed in the civil war in Libya, a group of friends came together and helped me get the BDC going.I guess you could call him a war photographer, but he was never interested in pictures of people shooting guns, and in that way he was like Larry Burrows and Henri Huet. He was always looking for something that showed how the wars were fought on the backs of civilians. Tim studied the classics and knew the Homeric wars, chapter and verse. He saw conflict as a modern tragedy, a sort of farce, that leaders played out, destroying the lives of men, women, and children along the way. I always loved this photo because it showed what war had done to the Liberian economy. It was once one of the fastest growing in West Africa. And by the time Tim and I got there in 2003, the country was in complete shambles. There'd been no electricity or running water for years, but we were lucky enough to finally come to the country.
 


I took this photo on an early morning raid in Balad, Iraq, in 2003, as the Iraq War was just ramping up. The New York Times had sent me in. In September, we all thought combat operations were over — little did we know, I was just getting started, went out with some soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Division. They were getting ambushed daily and starting to lose soldiers. They responded with early morning raids, smashing down doors, dragging men out of bed so they [could] search for weapons, and I saw these girls getting ready to go off to school as a Bradley fighting vehicle rumbled by, waited, and grabbed the photo. It's a photo that has always struck people. I think it's simply the juxtaposition. It might be a bit cliched, but it's real. We're fighting this war in people's front yards. And that's why hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead as a result.
 


I took this photo in Iraq in 2007, [which] was the bloodiest year of the war. I went with Damien and Diana Cave, a husband and wife who are also a reporter and videographer, into the Sunni triangle to do a story on some American soldiers who had been ambushed and kidnapped. They eventually turned up dead. As American soldiers went out to search for them, they also were being ambushed and killed. We went out before dawn with the 10th Mountain Division, and as we walked down trails through the countryside and the sun began to creep up over the horizon, I stepped over a landmine [that] had been buried in the trail and a guy behind me stepped on it and was killed instantly. A number of others were wounded, and I helped bandage them as I photographed. The Pentagon tried to stop publication of these photos. I actually had a bizarre phone call with a colonel in Washington, DC, who kept coming up with new reasons why I couldn't publish these photos. The New York Times backed me, and we published them anyway. When Damien Cave went back to see the unit, a year or two later, they called him into a conference room. He went in with some trepidation, afraid of what might happen. Instead, the soldiers thanked him profusely for telling Americans back home what the war was really like and showing people their sacrifices. Advertisement  
 


This photo is important to me because it's one of the first ones I ever took that really showed environmental devastation happening on this planet. In the States, the big corporations are very sophisticated, and they know how to hide the damage that they're doing. But when you go to Africa, it's just right there. They think no one is paying attention. I took this photo in Nigeria, in 2005, before there were really cell phone cameras around. The New York Times ran it on the front page. It served as a small piece of evidence of how several petroleum companies continue to flare gas to the present day and it is one of West Africa's major contributors to pollution and climate change. Advertisement  This picture shows young children playing at night in their village, which is bisected by massive pipelines and gas players. Gas is a byproduct of the company's drilling for oil. And they burn off millions and millions of cubic feet of it, destroying the environment and warming the planet.
 


I took this picture in the South Bronx in 1988; I believe there was a building full of artists who are squatting in an abandoned building around the corner from where I lived on Willis Avenue, got to know them, and began to photograph their struggle, as the city started to evict them. In this photo the squatters are stringing barbed wire to keep city marshals from entering the building and evicting them. I was relatively young; I was still working construction and learning to photograph at night and on the weekends. I learned the importance of finding a good story with good visuals and access, to tell the story of what people were going through and get at the larger social issues around poverty, race, and class that were dividing America then, and are dividing America even more so now.

This photo is by Trevon Blondet — he’s part of a group of Bronx photographers that I’ve been helping to train for quite a few years. Trevon has really taken to shooting black and white film with an old Hasselblad camera, and he’s great with people and has a real instinct for a good photo. He’s been doing portraits in a Bronx housing project where he once grew up, and I love everything about this photo: the composition, light, and feeling of a confident young man trying to move into adulthood on a hot summer afternoon in the South Bronx. And of course it’s incredibly rewarding to see a student like Trevon take what you show him and then surpass you.
 


This photo is by Johis Alarcón, and she’s been part of our Latin American Photo Festival that we put on every year here in the Bronx. Johis has been working on all kinds of social, humanitarian, and gender issues in Ecuador as well as documenting indigenous religious and cultural practices throughout the country. She really connects with people and has a wonderful sense of color, movement, and emotion in her photos. In her work, there is also a sense of trying to capture something that is threatened, that may not last, and that has to be seen and remembered. There is a tremendous documentary photography movement happening throughout South and Central America, most of it based on photo collectives, and Johis is part of that movement.
 


I’ve worked with Stephanie Sinclair going back to the Iraq War, and we’ve exhibited her Too Young To Wed project at the Bronx Documentary Center, where it made an enormous impact on the community. Stephanie has been working on this project for a decade in dozens of countries. This photo is from Yemen, where Stephanie documented a tradition of young girls being married off to older men. For me, this photo really brings home the exploitation of young girls all over the world as they are forced into various kinds of subjugation. It varies by region and culture, but it’s happening everywhere. Too Young to Wed has been shown around the globe and — in the best tradition of photojournalism and documentary photography — brought major attention to this issue. Advertisement

When the first season of the Netflix docuseries Cheer debuted in January 2020, it was a commercial and critical hit. The show, about a group of cheerleaders at Navarro Junior College in Corsicana, Texas, and their coach, Monica Aldama, put the tremendous hard work and athleticism of cheerleaders on full display.But while the show challenged people’s perceptions of how much effort goes into cheerleading, it also veered into precarious myths of toxic positivity, with its emphasis on young people sacrificing their bodies for the sake of the team. And most jarring of all was the October 2020 arrest of fan-favorite Jerry Harris for alleged sexual assault. Advertisement     Given this context, it’s surprising that the series’ creator and executive producer, Greg Whiteley, opted to do a second season of the show. “I am a huge believer in the power of stories and telling them honestly,” Whiteley said this past December when it was announced that the show would be returning. “I believe the story is going to ultimately be the best version of itself when you are honoring what is true, and you’re not running from it.” The second season, out today, is evenly split between the Navarro College cheerleaders and their rivals, the underdogs at Trinity Valley College, who reside about 45 minutes down the road in Athens, Texas, and are coached by Javontae Johnson.While the dramatic stakes are compelling and we see the return of familiar faces — including the self-assured La’Darius Marshall; the tumbler Lexi Brumback, who appears to be enjoying the various income opportunities of fame; and the all-star Gabi Butler — there’s a sense of unease that permeates the season because of the real-life criminal charges against Harris, who appears throughout the first half of the season. Harris, 22, was charged with one count of producing child sexual abuse images and for allegedly soliciting nudes from minors in October 2020; he was hit with subsequent charges just months later. (Harris denied the accusations in a statement to ABC News in September 2020, but when questioned by authorities he allegedly admitted to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in 2019. He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago since his arrest in September 2020 and no trial date has been set.)One episode halfway through the season, titled “Jerry,” is solely about the allegations and includes on-camera interviews with the victims of his alleged abuse and their mother. Harris’s former teammates frequently express shock, saying they never would have guessed he could commit such crimes.But given how the show depicts competitive cheerleading, it’s not hard to imagine how this sort of behavior would have flown under the radar. Aldama and her assistant coaches are frequently dismissive of the athletes' feelings. When cheerleaders who train hard for months only to not make mat (qualifying for the team that will perform at finals) are reasonably disappointed, Aldama is quick to shut down their chatter from the sidelines because they’re “being so negative,” as she says in one episode. The culture of toxic positivity, of always needing to put on a brave or smiling face and perfect their routine for the sake of the team, could make athletes feel uncomfortable speaking up about abuse. Advertisement     In the episode addressing the impact of Harris’s allegations on the lives of his former teammates, a Good Morning America clip plays. Aldama appears on a video call with the other contestants joining her for Season 29 of Dancing With the Stars. Meant to be a surprise, the morning show’s host cuts to Harris, who appears onscreen, hyping his coach up with his high-pitched voice and infectious enthusiasm. “Congratulations, Monica!” Harris screeches. “I’m so, so happy for you. I can’t wait to vote for you every week.” The former cheerleader’s spirited disposition is disarming, and from the many clips shown, this is pretty much the only side we see of him, save for the instances where he discusses his difficult upbringing.While it might be tough for some to imagine how a person with such a seemingly bright personality could be the source of pain for younger, more impressionable athletes participating in the sport, this dynamic is not uncommon when it comes to abuse. The episode where twin brothers Sam and Charlie tell their story explores how the public perception of Harris almost prevented them from coming forward. “[Harris] messaged me on my private Instagram account on his private Instagram account and like basically just saying, ‘Hey,’ and he asked how old I was,” Charlie says in the episode, recounting an incident that he says occurred during his first cheerleading season in December 2018. “And I told him that I was 13 and then after that, right off the bat, he asked me, ‘Can I have butt pics?’” At the time, Harris was 19.The episode captures how difficult it can be for sexual assault victims, especially minors, to speak out. Charlie and Sam knew of Harris long before he started messaging them on Snapchat because he was a rising star on one of their favorite cheer teams. They didn’t want to tell their story, at least at first, because it meant they would be ostracized by their peers, people who looked up to Harris. “It made me lose even more faith, I guess, in like just having a safe community in cheer,” Sam said, right after his brother said Harris cornered him in a bathroom during a practice event, demanding sex. Even after being charged with these crimes, Harris still exudes a puzzling optimism. His lawyers, according to Netflix, declined to be interviewed on camera, but Aldama said Harris wrote her a letter saying one day he hoped to become a motivational speaker. If convicted, Harris faces a minimum 15-year prison sentence.Throughout this season, it feels like Cheer is trying to toe the line between telling hard, uncomfortable truths about the sport of competitive cheerleading while also being inspirational television. In Season 1, you could actively applaud the Navarro team and its dedication to the sport, looking past the injuries the athletes sustained and the broken homes they escaped to make their dreams a reality. But Season 2, which was shot in 2020 and 2021, before and then during the pandemic, it feels icky to witness. Advertisement     Observing the young cheerleaders push past their breaking point and, even worse, seeing how the coaches poorly handle their emotions when it comes to the athletes’ needs illuminates the overwhelming stress of the sport. “So TT’s out until next Tuesday,” Aldama says in Episode 3’s “Dracut Girl,” referring to a stunter, visibly annoyed by the delays this will cause for the team’s tight practice schedule. “Seems extreme,” she says, right before briefly walking outside of the gym because she needed a “new attitude.” TT’s exact ailment isn’t addressed, but there’s an acknowledgment that he has had “headaches.” That Aldama doesn’t seem sympathetic to his pain is concerning.Understandably, no one handles their emotions well every single time, and Aldama and the assistants are human like anyone else, but as the season continues, you begin to pick up on several instances where the leaders come across as cold and indifferent to various dilemmas pertaining to the cheerleaders. Even when it comes to the emotional needs of the cheerleaders, it often feels like the coaches don’t think about how their decisions impact players. There’s another scene in that same episode where newcomer Maddy is replaced in a stunt routine without a proper heads-up about the abrupt switch. Moments later, she breaks down crying. “How did I go from being center stunt to not being there at all?” she asks Aldama through tears. “I could’ve gotten, like, a warning before practice.” It doesn’t feel like the cheerleader’s concerns are adequately validated, as everything — even minor expressions of dissent — comes back to the needs of the team. “If we make a decision that I feel is best for the team, I need you to support that, all right?” Aldama says.While watching Cheer, you will undoubtedly marvel at the incredible stunts the athletes are able to pull off, and you’ll likely tear up when listening to some of the neophytes talk about their journey into the sport, as well as their hopes and dreams for after. But the darker side of cheer makes for tough viewing. As the pandemic continues, some athletes question whether it was worth it to leave their hometowns for the chance to train at Navarro. By the end of the season, some choose not to return. Cheer will likely be a hit for Netflix once again, but this time it’s harder to find anyone to root for. ●

46,"“If you’re committed, you went all the way.”","At long last, Season 2 of Euphoria is finally here. Over two years since its first season premiered, the hit HBO series, which stars Zendaya, finally returned to screens on Sunday with an action-packed first episode. And despite a generous serving of onscreen drama, a particular behind-the-scenes moment still managed to divert some of the attention. So, if you’ve watched the first episode already, you’ll know that Season 2 is set to welcome a number of new characters to the show’s star-studded ensemble. However, the addition of a few new faces didn't stop fans from doing a double-take after spotting an imposter in a newly surfaced snap of the cast. On Monday, photographer Siyon Foster celebrated the launch of Season 2 with a backstage photo dump, providing fans on Instagram with a selection of brand-new behind-the-scenes shots that look to have been taken while shooting episode one. Upon further inspection of the gallery, eagle-eyed viewers noticed an eerie figure lurking in the background of a group photograph, a familiar peace sign peeking out from behind Zendaya, who posed with her costars. In case you’ve not already guessed, fans collectively identified the silhouette as Zendaya’s boyfriend, Tom Holland, inevitably prompting a LOT of excitement on social media. Before we proceed, we must preface that the picture in question is pretty dark and grainy, making it nearly impossible to say for certain if it’s Tom, or just someone who resembles him. (Not to mention that he’s also wearing a mask, which — while praiseworthy — does not help with the investigation.) Nonetheless, I think we can pretty safely assume that the masked individual huddled behind Zendaya is probably who we think it is. Especially given that Tom recently revealed that he visited the set ""at least 30 times"" while they shot Season 2. If you know anything about Tom and Zendaya, that piece of information probably won’t come as a surprise to you, particularly in light of the fact that the Spider-Man star has made no secret of his desire to get involved with Euphoria. Stepping away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a moment, Tom explained during an interview in December that he had been “petitioning” for a role on the hit series. “It has not happened yet and I'm very disappointed,” he said at the time. “I want to be in Euphoria!” And given that Zendaya also serves as an executive producer on the show, the idea that she might be able to wrangle a cameo for her boyfriend doesn’t seem out of the question. However, despite his promising appearance behind the scenes, it sounds a lot like we might have to wait a bit longer to get the Marvel/Euphoria crossover we deserve. Addressing the cameo speculation during a conversation with E! News on Jan. 7, Zendaya hinted that she actually asked the show’s producers if they could work in an appearance for Tom. “I mean, listen, we've talked about it all the time,” she said. “We're like, ‘Let's just sneak him in the back of a shot or something!’” So, while it seems unlikely that we’ll be seeing Tom’s face in this season of Euphoria, we’ve certainly got our hopes up for the future. And besides, if there’s one thing to be learned from his recent performance in Spider-Man: No Way Home, it’s that Tom knows a thing or two about legendary crossovers. And we’ll leave it at that."
47,"In the second season of Netflix’s Cheer, we see an even uglier side of the sport.","Unless you’ve been living under a rock lately, you’re probably aware that Ghostface is back in town for a brand-new installment of the horror movie franchise Scream. The new movie, which is set for release this week, has been described as “an absolute, brand-new relaunch of the franchise” by star Courteney Cox, who also appeared in the original 1996 movie. But its release has still served as an excuse for the OG cast to enjoy a reunion, with Courteney joining Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Drew Barrymore for a candid chat on The Drew Barrymore Show this week. As the group discussed their experiences on set, Drew recalled having a pregnancy scare that left her “freaking out” — and how she turned to Courteney for help through it. Drew only briefly appeared in the movie but featured prominently in the promo leading up to its release, which gave her plenty of time to bond with her costar. Speaking to Courteney on the show, Drew reflected: “We became so close, Courteney. I remember at the poster shoot I was, like, having a nervous breakdown because I was having a false sense of being pregnant.” “I kept asking you, 'How do you know if you're pregnant? Like, I'm freaking out! We're supposed to shoot this poster but oh my god, I just started dating somebody! How do you know?’” Drew continued. “I felt safe going to you, like you were the mature, safe person in the room.” It turns out that Drew had no reason to panic because it was a false alarm, and the star didn't become a mom for another 16 years when she welcomed her daughter Olive with ex-husband Will Kopelman. While Drew may not have given us the first Scream child, Courteney and David reflected on how their daughter is a direct result of the franchise and how much the movie changed their lives in every possible way. Their daughter Coco was born in June 2004, with David telling Drew: “We had a daughter out of it and she's the greatest thing in my life. That really is the most impactful thing that has ever happened to me in this business.” Courteney echoed his sentiments, with the pair still on good terms despite calling it quits on their relationship in 2013. The Friends star also admitted that Scream had changed her life in a way that most fans can probably relate to, explaining: “I will not go to the bathroom in a movie theater or just about any sports arena.” And for that, I have to admit, I don’t blame her."
48,How about that Euphoria/Marvel crossover?,"


Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense. Advertisement     “The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

49,"Drew got super real about the false alarm as she reunited with her former costars ahead of Scream’s relaunch, and it turns out that it isn’t just Ghostface that gave her the heebie jeebies on set.","In spring 2021, pop culture enthusiasts everywhere rejoiced as it was revealed that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck had started dating again — almost 20 years after they broke up. Bennifer were initially a staple power couple of the ‘00s, dating for two years between 2002 and 2004 and even getting engaged before calling it quits. Over the next 17 years, the pair went their separate ways as they started families and found love with new partners. Jennifer married singer Marc Anthony in June 2004 — just five months after her split from Ben — and the pair welcomed twins before breaking up in 2011. She went on to have relationships with dancer Casper Smart, and New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez (below). Meanwhile, Ben shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner, who he was married to between 2005 and 2018. After their breakup, he dated actor Ana de Armas. But in living proof that true love will always find a way, the former couple reconnected in 2021; first romantically linked in April before Jennifer publicly confirmed their romance in July. The pair have been relatively low-key about their reunion, but made their red carpet debut at Venice Film Festival in September in support of Ben’s movie The Last Duel, before attending the Met Gala together just days later. And in December, Ben spoke candidly about his decision to get back with Jennifer, admitting that he was initially hesitant to take the plunge due to the toll the media scrutiny could take on his children. During an interview with Howard Stern, Ben was asked: “Was there hesitation on your part, because now you’re a dad? Was there hesitation on your part to say, you know, 'I can’t go through this again'?” Ben replied: “It crossed my mind for sure. My responsibility to my children is the highest responsibility, I don’t want to do anything that is painful or destructive to them if I can help it.” But just weeks later, it appears that Bennifer 2.0 is still going from strength to strength, with Ben even at the forefront of Jennifer’s resolutions for 2022. Taking to her Instagram page on Tuesday, the singer spoke openly about her plans for the year, sharing: “I’m just thinking about being really mindful about what I want my life to be, and knowing my thoughts create my life, so keeping those really positive.” Jennifer went on: “To be the best mother I can be, the best partner I can be, the best friend I can be, the best daughter, sister, boss, person that I can be.” The vows came as Ben offered a fresh insight into his and Jennifer’s relationship during a new interview published on Tuesday, in which he opened up about the romance's origin story in 2001. The pair first met on the set of the movie Gigli, which was released in 2003 but began filming two years earlier. The movie bombed at the box office and received widely negative reviews. Despite Gigli’s lack of acclaim, Ben has fond memories of it — largely because it introduced him to Jennifer. In a new interview with Matt Damon for Entertainment Weekly, Ben shared: “If the reaction to Gigli hadn't happened, I probably wouldn't have ultimately decided, 'I don't really have any other avenue but to direct movies,' which has turned out to be the real love of my professional life. So in those ways, it's a gift.” He added: “And I did get to meet Jennifer, the relationship with whom has been really meaningful to me in my life."" Ben previously acknowledged how “lucky” he is to have ""benefitted from second chances"" throughout his life, telling WSJ magazine for its December/January cover story: “I've had second chances in my career. I've had second chances as a human being."" Thankfully, he and Jennifer both seem to be making the most of their second chance at their relationship."

A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined to dismiss a sexual assault lawsuit against Prince Andrew, who is being sued by a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him while she was a minor and under the control of former financier Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Lewis Kaplan said in his ruling that he denied ""in all respects"" the duke's attempts to stop the case.The decision is the latest blow against Andrew, who has consistently denied the accusations of Virginia Giuffre, now 38, and a vocal critic of the justice system’s failures in the Epstein case. The Duke of York’s lawyers have unsuccessfully fought to have the civil lawsuit thrown out for months. Advertisement     In the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Giuffre says Andrew sexually abused her on multiple occasions between 2000 and 2002 while knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim under the age of 18. Specifically, Giuffre says she was forced to engage in sex acts with the duke in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Andrew was a longtime friend and associate of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Epstein’s former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein killed himself in a federal detention center in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and abusing dozens of underage girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of federal sex trafficking charges for her role in Epstein’s illicit operation on Dec. 29. She could face up to 65 years in prison.Giuffre first publicly accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a different Epstein-related lawsuit in December 2014. She then sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages on Aug. 9, 2021, under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a temporary law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period.The duke and his legal team have fought from the beginning to make Giuffre's case go away. Andrew was able to avoid being served for nearly a month — and even then, his legal team at first claimed that he had not been properly presented with the official documents under UK and international law. (Kaplan rejected this argument in a ruling dated Sept. 17.) Advertisement     
 


Before the hearing, Kaplan rejected a defense motion that attempted to delay proceedings based on the argument that Giuffre primarily resides in Australia and not the United States. The judge also ordered the unsealing of a 2009 secret settlement between Epstein and Giuffre, which Andrew’s legal team claimed included a clause preventing her from suing the royal.In the hearing, the duke’s lawyer Andrew Brettler questioned the constitutionality of the Child Victims Act and cited Giuffre’s 2009 settlement of a sex trafficking case against Epstein in his arguments to dismiss charges on Tuesday. He also argued that Giuffre had not been explicit enough in her allegations against Andrew, which led to a tense moment in the virtual courtroom.""Ms. Giuffre doesn't articulate what supposedly happened to her at the hands of Prince Andrew,"" he said. “We do not know the details of the allegations, and it's time that we do before Prince Andrew should be required to answer these very serious allegations."" Advertisement     “That's not a dog that's going to hunt here,” Kaplan responded, saying that Giuffre’s claim that she had been forced to engage in sexual intercourse was specific enough for the current stage of the proceedings.The judge emphasized this in his ruling. ""Ms. Giuffre's complaint is neither 'unintelligible' nor 'vague' nor 'ambiguous,'"" he wrote. ""It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations. It identifies to whom it attributes that sexual abuse.""Kaplan also shot down the defense's arguments about the constitutionality of the Child Victim's Act, saying that it had been upheld in the face of other legal challenges. (He called Brettler's argument ""creative"" but ""without merit."")A provision in the 2009 settlement between ​​Giuffre and Epstein prohibits her from pursuing legal action against the financier and anyone who “could have been included as a potential defendant” in that matter. Although the document does not name Andrew, Brettler argued that he should be included in the “potential defendant” category.Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies disagreed, saying that the 2009 settlement only concerned sex trafficking.“​​There is no allegation that Prince Andrew was the person transporting. There is no allegation that Prince Andrew fell into the category of people who were doing the trafficking,” Boies said. “He was somebody to whom the girls were trafficked.""Kaplan sided with Boies on this point in his opinion, saying the settlement does not preclude Andrew from facing Giuffre's accusations in a court of law. Advertisement     ""The 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, that the parties intended the instrument 'directly,' 'primarily,' or substantially 'to benefit Prince Andrew,'"" he wrote. ""The Court cannot rewrite the 2009 agreement to give the defendant rights where the agreement does not clearly manifest an intent to create them.""The next key date in the case is Jan. 14, when Giuffre’s legal team will respond to discovery requests from Andrew’s attorneys.Andrew is ninth in line to the British throne. He stepped back from royal life following a disastrous BBC interview in November 2019, in which he denied dancing with or meeting Giuffre — despite having been pictured with his arm around her waist (Andrew said he had no memory of the photograph being taken). He also disputed Giuffre’s allegation that he sweated on her while dancing at a London club by claiming that he cannot perspire as a result of his military experience in the Falkland Islands.Giuffre’s lawyers have requested as part of the discovery process proof of this medical condition and evidence that he was, as he told the BBC, attending a birthday party at a Pizza Express with his daughter on the date of one of the alleged assaults.

Bellecourt was also known for protesting major professional sports teams for using Native Americans as their mascots and in their names.""America is scholastically retarded about Indian culture and history and how the West was really won,"" Bellecourt said in 1991 during a protest at an Atlanta Braves game. ""It is pure ignorance.""He continued to lead AIM until 2020, when he stepped aside due to health issues, according to Indian Country Today.
 


Born on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota, Bellecourt's Ojibwe name was Nee-gon-we-way-we-dun, which means “Thunder Before the Storm.” He was the only remaining living founder of the AIM, the organization's current co-director Lisa Bellanger told the Associated Press.

Two men have been arrested in connection to the fatal shooting of rapper Young Dolph in Tennessee last year, but law enforcement officials on Wednesday said they have yet to determine a motive in the deadly shooting.Investigators are still sorting through a slew of tips, information, rumors, and innuendo to pin down why the two suspects — one of them a rapper — allegedly carried out the killing. Advertisement     ""We're just not ready to put this out yet,"" Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said at a news conference Wednesday.Young Dolph, whose given name is Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., was shot at Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies in Memphis in November. The 36-year-old made his debut in 2008 with ""Paper Route Campaign"" and built a reputation as one of the most prolific rappers in the industry, at one point making a music video from his hospital room after being shot in Los Angeles in 2017. His collaborators included Megan Thee Stallion and Gucci Mane, and he often worked with his fellow Memphis rapper and protégé Key Glock.
 


There were no suspects immediately after the shooting but, on Jan. 5, the US Marshals Service and Memphis Police announced a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Justin Johnson, a Memphis native and rapper who goes by the name of Straight Drop.Johnson had stated on social media on Monday that he planned to turn himself in, according to a statement from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office. But ultimately, he didn't.Instead, Johnson was taken into custody in Indiana Tuesday, the US Marshals officials said in a statement. Johnson was found after officials received more than 500 tips, largely prompted by the reward, officials said.Johnson also had an outstanding warrant for violating the terms of his supervised federal release, according to the statement.A third man, 27-year-old Shondele Barnett, was also taken into custody along with Johnson and facing charges of being an accessory after the fact. Barnett is suspected of aiding Johnson as the two traveled through Indiana during the manhunt.On Tuesday, the Shelby County district attorney also announced that a grand jury had charged a second man, 32-year-old Cornelius Smith, with first-degree murder and a second count of attempted first-degree murder in connection to the deadly shooting on Nov. 17.Smith was arrested on Dec. 9 on an auto theft warrant for a white Mercedes-Benz, the vehicle authorities believe was used in the killing of Dolph.The car was stolen on Nov. 10 and found on Nov. 20, three days after the deadly shooting.Smith is in custody in Shelby County Jail.Johnson has not yet been charged in the killing, but Davis said an indictment was forthcoming.Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said Johnson had a lengthy criminal record that included an aggravated rape and aggravated robbery conviction when he was 17. In 2017, Johnson was convicted and served five years after shooting three people in a bowling alley.He was released nine months into his sentence, Weirich said, and in 2018, was indicted on a federal gun charge.He had been released from federal custody in May 2021.On Wednesday, officials declined to released more details about the November shooting, but said they had enough information to name Johnson as a person of interest in the shooting. An indictment, Davis said, was forthcoming.""We had enough probable cause to put out this wanted flyer for Johnson and we have enough information to ensure that he will see his day in court,"" Davis said.

An attorney for one of the defendants in the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has launched a direct attack on the credibility of the prosecution, claiming it misrepresented its knowledge of the actions of a key FBI informant whom it recently disparaged as a rogue “double agent.”The informant, Stephen Robeson, was accused last week by prosecutors of disobeying FBI rules and undermining the investigation into an alleged conspiracy to kidnap Whitmer and try her for treason. Among Robeson’s offenses, they claimed, was “offering use of 501(c) charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks.” Advertisement     But according to a new filing Tuesday by the attorney for defendant Adam Fox, the FBI was well aware that Robeson had made such offers. The filing includes a transcript of an August 2020 recording — listened to by two of the lead FBI agents in the probe — in which another informant tells Fox that the charity was used to purchase weapons.“While the Government attempts to minimize his involvement and its knowledge of the same,” the attorney, Christopher Gibbons, wrote, “the FBI maintained an intimate knowledge and control of [Robeson] and his activities.”A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the matter, referring inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Michigan also declined to comment, citing official policy to not discuss ongoing criminal matters.The five men facing federal trial in the case claim that they were entrapped by the government — and in particular by Robeson and another FBI informant, both of whom worked to recruit potential suspects, organize events such as the surveillance of Gov. Whitmer’s vacation home, and make hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings. The defendants also contend that there was no true conspiracy to kidnap anyone, and that the only planning was done by the FBI and its operatives. Advertisement     Prosecutors have pushed back, arguing that the defendants were predisposed to take violent action against the governor because of the strict COVID policies she had implemented. But they have also asked the judge to sharply limit the evidence that can be admitted into court when the trial begins March 8.They have, for example, said that they will not call three lead FBI agents in the case, and argued that many of the statements those men made during the course of the investigation should not be allowed as evidence. And last week they said that because of his misconduct, statements by Robeson should also be kept out of the courtroom.Robeson, who had been convicted of multiple felonies dating back to the early 1980s, began work for the FBI on Oct. 20, 2019, new evidence disclosed in Tuesday’s filing reveals, and was terminated as a confidential informant on Oct. 28, 2020, three weeks after the defendants in the Michigan case were arrested. The FBI paid him $19,328.79 for his work, the new evidence shows, and he helped organize at least four events that the government highlighted as critical in the evolution of the alleged conspiracy, even going so far as to pay for pizza, “moonshine,” and hotel rooms for attendees.While he was still working on the case, Robeson acquired a .50 caliber sniper rifle despite prohibitions on gun ownership by people with felony convictions. He was indicted last March in federal court on the gun charge and agreed to a plea deal in September. That deal, which offered him no jail time despite his extensive record and a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years, was an extremely favorable one — particularly if, as prosecutors now allege, they knew he had been secretly working “against the interests of the government.” Advertisement     Last month, Robeson was charged again, this time in Wisconsin state court. Notably, he is alleged to have defrauded a couple out of an SUV by convincing them it was going to a charity he controlled. Investigators found that there was no such charity and that Robeson had simply kept the vehicle for his own use. That fraud is alleged to have taken place during the same month that the two FBI agents overheard the conversation about Robeson’s use of a charity to acquire weaponry.In their filing last Thursday, prosecutors called Robeson a “noncompliant informant,” saying he undertook a number of “unauthorized acts,” including offering the charity funds, obtaining weapons, and offering to use a drone “to aid in acts of terrorism.” They also claim he failed to record certain events he was supposed to be informing the FBI about, attempted to destroy other evidence, and warned at least one defendant that he’d been approached by the government.Citing those reasons, prosecutors took the unusual step of arguing that his statements and actions while working for the FBI should be excluded from the case.In Tuesday’s filing, Gibbons challenged that argument. “The Government consistently relied on a specific cadre of agents and confidential informants from as early as October 2019 to October of 2020 in establishing its case against these defendants. The Government now seeks to distance itself from the very same group agents and informants, and their inconvenient actions and statements during the upcoming jury trial.” Advertisement     A hearing on what evidence will be admitted at trial is scheduled for next Tuesday in federal court.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

In his second sweeping speech on voting rights as president, Joe Biden made his most forceful rebuke to date of Senate Republicans for blocking laws that would protect voters. But six months on from Biden's first address calling for the bills to pass, they're still far from becoming a reality.“I ask every elected official in America, how do you want to be remembered? Consequential moments in history, they present a choice,” Biden said. “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? You want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? You want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Advertisement     Biden for the first time made it clear that he supports changing Senate rules to pass voting rights reform. That would require amending the way the Senate works for these specific bills so that they can pass with a simple majority instead of the current requirement of 60 votes to end a filibuster. Despite the president’s overt support for that change on Tuesday, it’s unlikely to happen. Two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have so far said they won’t vote for it, and several others are publicly undecided. Every Senate Democrat would need to vote to change the rules for the move to succeed.“We have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this,” Biden said. “The filibuster is not being used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart. The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.”Two landmark bills remain stalled in the Senate, and voting rights activists say they’ve yet to see a concrete plan from the White House on how they’ll get it passed. Biden’s remarks on Tuesday largely repeated his rhetoric from July 2021, when he gave a speech in Philadelphia, and from his calls on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.""I've been around the Senate a long time, and as vice president for eight years. I've never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice and is ready to speak for justice,” Biden said of Senate Republicans on Tuesday. Advertisement     He added that he had even worked with Sen. Strom Thurmond, a segregationist Republican, to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act at one point.He struck a much firmer tone with Republicans this week than he had last July, when Biden said he would be asking his “Republican friends — in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties — to stand up, for god’s sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote.”Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta to give the speeches despite several prominent local voting rights leaders boycotting their event, calling on them to stay in DC and get the legislation passed.“We were hoping that would be followed by the White House leaning into this issue of the legislation and the filibuster,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, of Biden’s July speech. “That did not happen, and that is why we're at the place where right now where what we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan.”The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban partisan gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reestablish the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters.For some, Biden’s visit brought welcome attention to the restrictive voting measures being put in place in Georgia.“We have been raising the alarm. It's not even canary in the coal mine anymore. It's like, the British are here. They’re not coming,” said Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. “So this is an unqualified recognition that the fight for voting rights is the most important fight for our government right now, for our leaders right now.” Advertisement     Ufot, like others on the ground, said she’s waiting to see what action follows this speech.“If my president and my vice president see this as an important intervention on the path to getting us the voting rights protections that our country needs right now, then I’m with it. Go for it,” Ufot said. “But what I'm saying is that we need a plan. We need a plan. We need to share the plan to get legislation passed.”NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he was “agnostic” on whether Biden and Harris should travel to Georgia on Tuesday. After the speech, he said in a statement that Biden “delivered a stirring speech today” but that “it’s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job.”

59,"Prosecutors say the informant’s statements should be barred from court, but defense attorneys have other ideas.","Kendall Jenner has finally spoken out about the little black dress that divided the internet. In case you need reminding, the 26-year-old found herself at the center of an explosive debate back in November after she attended the wedding of her friend, Lauren Perez, wearing a particularly eye-catching look. The black Mônot dress in question — which Kendall wore for the wedding reception — was aptly described by Vogue as a “skin-baring technical feat” and consisted of carefully placed triangular cutouts that exposed her bare midriff. And so, while she’s usually celebrated for her show-stopping looks on the runway, Kendall’s head-turning party dress caused quite the stir among fans who felt that it wasn’t appropriate for the occasion. Spiraling into a wider debate about wedding guest etiquette, some even accused Kendall of trying to upstage Lauren on her special day, suggesting that the fashion choice had been “blatantly disrespectful.” Thankfully, both ladies have now entered the chat to finally set the record straight. So, just when we thought we’d heard the last of the matter, the dress debate was reignited on New Year’s Eve after Lauren shared some snaps from her big day. “The greatest night of 2021! Happy New Year everyone!!!” the newlywed captioned her NYE Instagram post, which included several new photographs of Kendall’s afterparty attire. Once again, the risqué dress drew criticism from fans, including one who commented on the post calling the look ""inappropriate"" and ""cringe."" “Inappropriate outfit at a wedding @kendalljenner, I'm embarrassed for you. #cringe,” the user wrote. But not everyone shared the same sentiments. Taking the other side of the debate, another fan quickly hit back, asking: “If the bride herself doesn't gaf, why do you care, relax?” The exchange caught the attention of the bride, who put speculation to rest by backing up the second fan. “Tell ‘em!” Lauren wrote in agreement. “SHE LOOKED STUNNING AND I LOVED IT!” Swiftly weighing in for herself, Kendall broke her silence on the matter to confirm that she had sought the bride’s approval beforehand. “Obvi asked for your approval in advance too,” the model wrote in response to her friend. “We love a beach wedding.” And there you have it. Interestingly, Lauren has since removed all comments from the post, hopefully marking an official conclusion to the months-spanning debate. Meanwhile, another wedding conspiracy involving Kendall still remains unsolved. If you’ve been keeping an eye on social media over the last few weeks, you might already have heard whispers that Kendall walked down the aisle herself. Before you get too excited, it’s important we preface that there is a severe lack of evidence to support this fan theory, but feel free to make up your own mind as we present the facts. So, like Lauren, Kendall rang in the new year with an Instagram post of her own, documenting how she and her longtime boyfriend, NBA star Devin Booker, spent the holidays. And while there was plenty to marvel over in the festive photo dump, fans were quick to notice a very ~particular~ piece of jewelry located on Devin’s left ring finger. Inevitably, the presence of a conveniently placed gold band had fans spiraling in the comments section, theorizing that perhaps he and Kendall had tied the knot in secret. But despite fans' optimism, it’s worth noting that (as it stands) Kendall’s left hand appears to be void of any corresponding jewelry, presenting a minor hitch in the ~slightly~ flawed theory. Nonetheless, these two seem pretty happy together, and off the back of her bestie’s wedding, who says it’s out of the question?"

WASHINGTON – At least two congressional staffers from House and Senate committees reached out to the FBI and the Justice Department concerned about security at the Capitol ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The inquiries support accusations that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies were not prepared for the pro-Trump mob that stormed the US Capitol despite direct warnings and calls for help. Advertisement     BuzzFeed News is publishing another cache of documents turned over by the Justice Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the agency and the FBI related to events around Jan. 6. Emails released last November revealed that top Justice Department officials were told there were “no credible threats” hours before the riot.
 


The House Intelligence Committee on Jan. 5, 2021, requested a threat assessment and clarification on coordination between the FBI and the Defense Department related to the joint session, citing a “heightened public concern” about the role of law enforcement during the presidential transition. Advertisement     “In response, the Committee received a brief and non-substantive reply from the FBI that did not provide any information about potential threats on January 6,” a House Intel committee official told BuzzFeed News in a statement.
 


Another Democratic staffer from the Senate Appropriations Committee sent multiple emails before and during the Capitol riot asking if additional law enforcement would be deployed ahead of Congress’s joint session. The messages highlight the concern some congressional offices felt ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, where then-president Donald Trump was expected to promote the falsehood of a stolen presidential election.The unidentified Senate staffer’s correspondence with DOJ and the FBI began as early as Jan. 4 and ran until Jan. 7, according to the report. The staffer requested information before Jan. 6 as to which law enforcement agencies were on the ground and which agency was managing the ground forces and asked if DOJ had deployed air assets. But on the day the mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol, the emails to DOJ took on a new sense of urgency.By 2:45 p.m., 30 minutes after the rioters forced their way into the Capitol and ransacked the Senate chambers, the staffer sent an alarming message inquiring about DOJ’s presence.“Sooooo this has taken a turn for the worse,” the staffer wrote. “Can we have an update as to DOJ involvement, please?”The staffer also emailed the agencies immediately after Jan. 6. The committee would not identify the staffer but confirmed the office was in contact with DOJ and the FBI.
 


“We can confirm this was a staffer on the Appropriations Committee (minority staff at the time) asking relevant and timely questions to the DOJ and FBI, over which the committee has oversight, about a developing situation,” a committee spokesperson said in a statement.The Justice Department turned over additional documents as part of the new FOIA release, including intelligence memos prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI that were sent to state and federal law enforcement agencies before and after the insurrection summarizing threats and the potential for civil unrest. One of the memos notes the FBI had monitored reports about ""various threats to harm"" then-president-elect Joe Biden, vice president–elect Kamala Harris, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Subsequent intelligence memos produced in the weeks following the insurrection tallied the number of tips passed onto the FBI, which by Jan. 21 reached 208,799.Additionally, the Justice Department released a redacted copy of then–acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue's handwritten notes from a Jan. 4, 2021, phone call he had with Michael Sherwin, the then–acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, that discusses crowd estimates and law enforcement plans. Donoghue’s notes say: ""no need for additional resources now.""
 


Congressional leaders peppered FBI and DOJ officials for answers on what they knew in the lead-up to Jan. 6 and how they planned to respond during a closed-door briefing on Jan. 12, according to a transcript of the call released as part of the new FOIA cache. The FBI told members during the briefing that they had issued eight wanted posters for 72 individuals who were captured on camera. A year later, the arrest count exceeds 700.But the Justice Department redacted much of the responses to lawmakers' questions, citing national security, ongoing law enforcement investigations, and law enforcement techniques and procedures.Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, asked about the security threat ahead of Trump’s Jan. 13 impeachment vote and sought to get clarification on whether the temporary fencing erected after the riots was enough protection for the Capitol complex.An FBI representative explained that the physical security of the Capitol and crowd control were not the purview of the agency.“We are not experts in determining if the Capitol was hardened enough.”

61,The rumors reached new heights after a video of Ayesha speaking about lacking “male attention” outside of her and Steph’s marriage resurfaced on Twitter last month.,"


Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

LOS ANGELES — The chants outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse were familiar, but this time they weren't talking about Britney Spears.""Free Nichelle Nichols!""""Isolation is abuse!""""Hey hey, ho ho, the conservatorship has got to go!""On Monday afternoon, a group of just over a dozen #FreeBritney supporters and fans of Nichelle Nichols, who became a Star Trek legend for her portrayal of Nyota Uhura, marched around Stanley Mosk Courthouse to raise awareness about the 89-year-old actor's situation. Since 2018, Nichols has been living under what they believe is another abusive conservatorship that has allowed her son, Kyle Johnson, to take control of her life and finances and decide who she sees and where she lives. Advertisement     ""We're going to do whatever we can to shed light on the issue and to make sure that there's lasting change for not just Britney, not just Nichelle but everyone who is trapped in this corrupt system,"" #FreeBritneyLA organizer Kevin Wu told BuzzFeed News.
 


Known for her trailblazing role as Lt. Uhura in the original series that first aired in the 1960s, Nichols is now living with dementia, a condition that has made her susceptible to exploitation, Johnson claimed in his original petition to place her under the court's supervision. But her longtime friend Angelique Fawcette, a producer and actor, has argued that Nichols was and is able to manage her affairs with help from an assistant and that Johnson is not acting in her best interests.Instead, Fawcette says Johnson moved his mother out of her Woodland Hills home to New Mexico against her will, sold her property against her wishes, and isolated her from her friends. She points to a troubling 2019 recording of Nichols screaming at Johnson to get his hands off of her and a deposition from a former conservator who raised concerns about him having control as proof that he is unfit to take care of his mother. ""You're trying to get rid of me,"" Nichols cries at her son in the recording. Advertisement     ""You just can't come and take people’s home and money and just say, 'Hey, it's mine. Sorry, you're old, you're almost dead anyway, so I'm taking this,'"" Fawcette told BuzzFeed News. ""Look at all these amazing old people who are out there doing things. They’re living the life 'til their last drop and that's really what I'm fighting for, for Nichelle.""BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the US guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.During a hearing on Monday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge overruled Fawcette's objections to Johnson's final accounting report for his mother's conservatorship, which is now under the jurisdiction of a New Mexico court, finding that she did not have standing to lodge her complaints and that they did not pertain to any specific line items in the report.
 


Fawcette and her attorney Matthew Taylor tried to argue that Johnson failed to declare Nichols' home and neighboring property as assets of the conservatorship estate and provide the necessary evidence required by state statute to sell the properties. They also alleged that Johnson may be misappropriating his mother's assets and asked for time to conduct discovery to investigate their concerns. Advertisement     His attorney, Jeffrey Marvan, argued that the objection regarding Nichols' home, which was sold after the conservatorship was moved out of California, should instead be raised in New Mexico, and said Johnson acted appropriately.""He’s the only son and child,"" Marvan told the court via videoconference. ""The conservatee’s family supports everything that my client is doing.""
 


Johnson's attorney did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment Monday.Speaking to supporters outside the courthouse, Fawcette vowed to continue fighting for her friend.""I'd be damned if this is my last stand for Nichelle Nichols,"" she said. ""Whether you are white, Black, Latino, Asian, American Indian, Persian, no matter what you are, you have roots in the soil. And you have a right to stand up for yourself and you have a right to stand up for your family and your friends.""Dressed in a replica red Star Trek shirt like the one Nichols wore in the sci-fi show, Alexa Justo wiped her eyes as Fawcette spoke. The 26-year-old grew up worshipping Nichols as Lt. Uhura. Advertisement     ""She was definitely one of the only people I could look up to as a kid,"" said Justo, who is Black and Latina. ""She made it cool to be smart. She made it cool to be strong and obviously the whole being a woman of color — it’s not just for me personally but for the world, in general, her being one of the only characters that wasn’t like a slave or a maid. That means a lot.""Justo said she didn't think it was fair for Nichols to be placed in conservatorship, a system in which people lose basic rights and are exposed to, as a BuzzFeed News investigation found, abuse, exploitation, and even death.""Whether you’re emotionally invested or not, you should give a shit,"" Justo said. ""And Nichelle’s awesome, so you should give a shit about her. ""

The Bronx apartment building where a fire killed 17 people Sunday had a history of serious violations related to heat, ventilation, and other safety issues, some of which were still unresolved when officials say a malfunctioning space heater sparked one of the deadliest blazes in the city’s history.The Twin Parks North West apartment building, built in 1972 in the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, was home to dozens of families with low incomes, many of them immigrants. The 120-unit brick building had no fire escapes and outdated stairways, making it difficult for residents to flee the thick smoke that quickly enveloped their halls and homes largely in part to a door that did not close when it should have. The victims suffered from severe smoke inhalation, Daniel A. Nigro, the city’s fire commissioner, said, acknowledging that the death toll, which includes eight children, will likely rise as “there are many people fighting for their lives in the hospital.” Advertisement     This is the second time in just a week that residents in public housing died after a fire tore through their homes. Last Wednesday, flames swept through a crowded federally subsidized rowhouse in Philadelphia, killing 12 people, eight of them children.In the years and months before the Bronx blaze, tenants of the public housing complex had repeatedly reported that their apartments had no heat, faulty radiators, and broken ventilation systems, data shows.Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, which owns the building and other affordable housing complexes, said it was fully cooperating with the investigation and helping assist residents.“We are devastated by the unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy,” the company said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.” Advertisement     Violations filed with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) show that some automatic self-closing doors, which are required in all buildings with three or more apartments and help slow a fire's spread, did not work in 2017 and 2019.The fire commissioner said Monday that when a family fled the fire on the second and third floor, their front door did not shut, which would have thwarted the spread of smoke. Another door on the 15th floor also malfunctioned and stayed open. Records show that the residents of the unit where the fire started had filed a ticket for a malfunctioning self-closing door in the past.An HPD spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the department fixed those complaints in 2020, adding that issues pertaining to self-closing doors “were reinspected and all were observed corrected by HPD Inspectors by August 2020.” Last fiscal year, the department said it had issued more than 22,000 self-closing door violations and ultimately resolved 18,000.“Yesterday's fire was a devastating tragedy, and our hearts go out to all the families affected by the worst kind of loss,” HPD said. “We urge residents to report malfunctioning doors to property owners or call 311 if issues are not corrected and HPD will respond.”
 


Though property owners say the building was up to code, residents have said their doors did not close automatically.In October, someone on the 12th floor reported “broken or defective fire retardant material” in public parts of the building. That is a C-class violation, which means it’s “immediately hazardous.” Then on April 11, that same resident filed a request to repair “the broken or defective mechanical ventilation system” in the apartment. That ticket was still open at the time of the fire. Ten days earlier, another tenant filed a B-class violation, meaning “hazardous,” for an additional report of “broken or defective fire retardant material” on the first floor. That request is also still open, according to records. Other complaints from December and November flagged exposed electrical wiring in the lobby, broken radiators, and defective doors.In 2021, residents of the Twin Parks North West filed more than 30 complaints that detailed dangerous and poor living conditions. In addition to the filings about ventilation and fire retardant material, other “immediately hazardous” requests from tenants that remain open describe lead paint in their bathrooms and hallways, roach infestations in kitchen walls, and mice crawling throughout their entire apartments.One unit, 6K, made 10 different complaints last month alone, including “no heat,” roaches in the entire apartment, a front door that does not self-close, a broken radiator in the living room, a damaged pipe in the bathroom, and no heat. Most of these filings were marked as resolved before the blaze, according to records. Advertisement     Residents also had problems with their heat. Several reports dating back to December 2020, all of which have been marked as closed, describe apartments that had no heat. Officials say a space heater that had been running for a few days malfunctioned and sparked the fire, which New York housing advocates say signals that the heat was inadequate for the frigid temperatures that hit the borough last week.“The stories we have heard about inadequate heating in places like this are a broken record, and landlords are not held accountable,” Edward Garcia, the director of community development for the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a racial and economic justice organization, told BuzzFeed News. “People do what they need to do to stay safe. Being in a really cold apartment triggers health issues like asthma, and the Bronx has some of the worst health outcomes in the state.”On Monday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams reiterated that the building had ""no outstanding violations"" for complaints related to lack of heat. But in an interview with Good Morning America, he also acknowledged that there “may have been a maintenance issue” with the apartment door where the fire started.
 


The Twin Parks North West is part of a public housing portfolio recently acquired and managed by a group of wealthy, high-profile investors, emblematic of a housing market trend where real estate conglomerates have been buying lower-income housing buildings. As JustFix.nyc notes, Reliant Realty Services, which is listed as the managing agent of the Bronx complex, is connected to 123 other New York City buildings, most of which are in lower-income neighborhoods.At the end of 2019, a group of real estate companies purchased the Twin Parks North West, along with other affordable housing units in the Bronx, as part of a $170 million deal, the Real Deal reported at the time. The LIHC Investment Group is officially known in city records as Bronx Park Phase III Preservation, and includes several high-profile investors, such as Camber Property Group. Camber has been scooping up affordable housing complexes and runs a spate of units across New York City, mostly in the Bronx. Its cofounder, Rick Gropper, is listed as the landlord for the Twin Parks complex and also happens to be named as a member of the mayor’s transition team for housing issues.In press releases and articles announcing the purchase of the eight Bronx buildings, the coalition of new property owners said they planned ""to make operational improvements"" and preserve the 1,275 units as affordable housing. According to state filings, the building has not had any applications for renovations since 2015 for plumbing.Gropper is listed as the landlord for 43 of the 123 buildings in the portfolio, according to a database by JustFix.nyc. Eugene Schneur, the co-founder of another real estate firm called Omni New York, runs the rest. According to records, tenants in these buildings have made 29,266 complaints, 12,203 of which were in the past three years. Advertisement     The buildings, however, do have a better average of closed complaints compared to the rest of the city (an average of 0.3 open HPD violations per unit vs the city's average of 0.8 per unit). The most common issue for residents is heat and hot water, the database notes.

WASHINGTON — Donald Trump cannot be sued for pretty much anything he said while he was in the White House, including his speech on Jan. 6 that preceded the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters and his tweets throughout the day, a lawyer for the former president argued in court on Monday.Less than a week after the one-year anniversary of the Capitol riot, a federal judge in Washington, DC, considered the fate of three civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump and his allies responsible for the attack — specifically, conspiring to interfere with Congress’s certification of the 2020 election results and incite violence against police officers who tried to protect the Capitol complex. Advertisement     US District Judge Amit Mehta asked questions that suggested he was at a minimum skeptical of Trump’s sweeping argument that he was immune against being sued for nearly anything he’d said during his four years as president. But Mehta also said during the hearing that he was struggling with whether the core conspiracy claim could go forward based on the facts laid out in the lawsuits, and whether comments by Trump and some of his other high-profile supporters on Jan. 6 were covered by the First Amendment’s free speech protections.It was the second time in just over a month that a court considered the argument that Trump couldn’t personally be sued over things he said while he was president. In early December, a federal appeals court in New York weighed efforts by Trump, backed by the Justice Department, to have the US government take over his defense against a defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A lower court judge had rebuffed the argument that Trump was acting within the scope of his official duties when he said Carroll was lying after she accused him of raping her more than two decades ago. The appeals court has yet to rule.Trump isn’t trying to involve the Justice Department in his defense against the growing number of lawsuits seeking to hold him responsible for the events of Jan. 6. He’s broadly arguing that he’s protected by a legal doctrine that shields sitting presidents from being sued over actions they take as part of the job. Arguments on Monday focused on three of the cases: one brought by a group of congressional Democrats, one brought by Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, and one brought by two US Capitol Police officers.A ruling from Mehta won't end the legal wrangling over Trump’s civil liability for the insurrection. If Trump fails to convince Mehta to toss these first three cases, he could ask an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court to intervene. If Trump succeeds at this stage, the plaintiffs could appeal. And there are four other civil lawsuits pending that accuse Trump of inciting the violence, plus one filed before Jan. 6 that accuses Trump of conspiring with the Republican National Committee to violate the rights of Black voters by trying to undermine the results of the election. Advertisement     Trump’s lead attorney, Jesse Binnall — a Virginia-based lawyer representing Trump in an array of postpresidency legal fights, and who counts Trump ally Michael Flynn as a former client and conservative attorney and activist Sidney Powell as a former co-counsel — argued Monday that presidential immunity extended to the “outer perimeters” of a president’s actions while in office.Mehta asked if Binnall wanted the judge to ignore the content of what Trump said on Jan. 6. Binnall replied yes, explaining that what mattered for immunity was the type of act at issue, which in this case was a speech to the American people, something that is part of being president.Mehta pushed back, pointing out that the lawsuits alleged that Trump had appeared at the Jan. 6 rally to advance his personal interests as a candidate for office. The judge asked Binnall why that wouldn’t place Trump outside the immunity that’s meant to protect a president against being sued for actions that were part of their official duties. Binnall argued that there was too much overlap between a president’s duties and political motivations to try to draw a clear line. Even if campaign activities weren’t covered by the immunity, Binnall said, Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 was not part of his campaign.The judge then asked about reports that Trump had contacted Georgia’s top election official to ask him to “find” votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s win in the state. Mehta asked Binnall if presidential immunity would apply to that type of phone call. Binnall said it would because a president had a constitutional duty to ensure laws were faithfully executed. When the judge noted that part of the Constitution didn’t apply to state laws, Binnall said that when it came to federal elections, state and federal functions merged. Advertisement     Mehta asked if a president would get immunity if they made defamatory statements at a campaign rally. Binnall said yes.The judge then asked if there was anything a president could say while they were in office that they could be sued for. Binnall said he’d tried to think of examples and could not.On the substance of the lawsuits, Mehta said that the plaintiffs had alleged a “very unusual” and “problematic” conspiracy. Taken together, the cases accused Trump of conspiring with high-profile allies like Rudy Giuliani as well as extremist groups whose members are being criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol. The judge noted that the lawsuits didn’t feature the kind of direct communication among co-conspirators that would normally be part of a case like this. He expressed concern that it would be “dangerous” to build a conspiracy case off of reactions to political speech.Joseph Sellers, an attorney for the congressional Democrats suing Trump who argued on behalf of all three sets of plaintiffs on Monday, maintained that the lawsuits did lay out facts that alleged a “meeting of the minds,” and not just a one-sided reaction to Trump’s speech. He said that Trump’s supporters engaged with his social media posts leading up to Jan. 6 about coming to Washington, that Trump urged the crowd to go to the Capitol even as people yelled out about storming and invading the building, and that Trump failed to immediately try to stop the riot, which could be seen as proof that he endorsed the mob.Sellers said that the law didn’t require them to show direct communication among all of the defendants, and he pointed out that they had presented facts that alleged coordination between two right-wing groups named in one of the cases, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Mehta acknowledged that was true, but noted that the plaintiffs would likely be disappointed if he allowed the conspiracy claims against those groups to go forward but dismissed them against Trump. Advertisement     Mehta is deeply familiar with the Justice Department’s theories so far on the role that members of the Oath Keepers played on Jan. 6. He’s presiding over a large conspiracy case that prosecutors have brought against members of the group; charges are pending against 17 defendants, and four defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government. The Oath Keepers have a pending motion to dismiss the Democrats’ civil lawsuit they’re named in, and Mehta is considering that as well.During an exchange with Binnall about the future of the conspiracy claim against Trump, Mehta asked about the fact that Trump didn’t tweet or put out other public statements telling the mob to stop immediately after the attack had begun. Binnall said that a president couldn’t be liable for not taking a certain action. The judge countered that Trump’s public silence could support the idea that Trump understood he was part of an agreement to disrupt Congress’s activities on Jan. 6. Mehta also drew a comparison to a civil lawsuit against organizers of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that turned violent; a jury last year found white nationalist Richard Spencer and others liable for conspiring to incite racially motivated violence.Mehta on Monday also considered whether claims lodged against Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani, who were named as defendants in Swalwell’s case, could go forward. Mehta suggested there wasn’t as much of a record of Trump Jr. making public calls to action to the same extent as his father, and referenced public reports that Trump Jr. had messaged Trump’s chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, to try to get Trump to stop the mob.Near the end of the hearing, Mehta heard arguments on defendant Republican Rep. Mo Brooks’ effort to have the US government step into the case on his behalf, based on the argument that he was acting in his official capacity when he spoke at the Jan. 6 rally. The Justice Department has opposed stepping in on his behalf. Advertisement

A cadre of prominent voting rights organizations working on the ground in Georgia is boycotting President Joe Biden’s voting rights speech in the state Tuesday, protesting the slow progress on two landmark bills that have stalled in the Senate.“What we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, on a call with reporters. “What we need is for him to lean into the filibuster and do what he has not yet done, which is give a clear call for it to be modified, not just telling us what he's open to, and not just telling us when he could possibly support if it's necessary, but to have a full-throated call for changing the filibuster in order to pass voting rights.” Advertisement     Biden plans to travel to Georgia with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, where both are slated to give speeches on the importance of voting rights legislation. There’s been little movement on Capitol Hill — despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's call for the Senate to vote on measures that would lay the groundwork to pass the voting rights legislation before Jan. 17.“​​There is not time during these fights to attend a speech and meet to reiterate the seriousness of this moment,” the groups said in a statement a day before Biden and Harris's trip to Georgia. The statement was signed by the New Georgia Project Action Fund, the Black Voters Matter Action Fund, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, the GALEO Impact Fund, and James Woodall, the former president of the Georgia NAACP.Asked about the groups’ calls for Biden to stay in DC and work on passing legislation rather than traveling to Georgia for the speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that the president would prefer to pass voting rights legislation with the support of a majority of the Senate.“His plan is to sign voting rights legislation into law,” Psaki told reporters during a Monday press briefing. “That requires a majority of senators to support it even if there are changes to the Senate rules, which is something the president has expressed an openness to.” Advertisement     The voting rights groups’ announcement to skip the president’s speech comes as they have grown frustrated that Senate procedure has stalled the bills. Senate Democrats support both bills but face a steep hurdle in the evenly divided chamber, where it takes 60 votes to pass legislation. Democrats have called for reforms to the procedure, which would require 51 votes, but Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have each voiced opposition to any carve-outs on the procedure.“It was very telling to us that this wasn't item number one on the agenda as soon as the president was inaugurated,” said Kendra Davenport Cotton, chief operating officer of the New Georgia Project.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell aggressively used the filibuster to kill legislation during the Obama and Trump administrations and has consistently warned Democrats against changing the rules.At the same time, 19 restrictive voting laws were passed in 2021 by Republicans on the state and local levels across the country, propelled by conspiracy theories denying the legitimacy of Biden’s win. In the past year, Georgia Republicans have passed several of those restrictive bills; the legislation at stake in the Senate would prevent those bills from taking effect, requiring states not to impose unreasonable voter ID and access laws and implementing national standards for how elections are run.“We think it sets a serious precedent that at the end of the day, when there are people that are coming after your base of voters, right, and you're stringing it out, and you're not reacting,” said LaTosha Brown, a Georgia-based advocate and cofounder of Black Voters Matter. Advertisement     She added, “How is it that now, myself, as a Black woman — I actually have less protection now than I did a year ago?”Biden previously called on the Senate to return to a rule that would require senators to continuously speak on the floor to delay a bill from passing. But advocates on the call said that the president needs to more forcefully back changing the filibuster rules.The two bills in question would significantly increase voter access in the US. The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reinforce portions of the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters.Albright said the groups would only be satisfied if Biden and Harris arrive in Georgia tomorrow to announce an actual agreement on voting rights — with the backing of Sinema and Manchin. “Anything short of that would be disappointing and not worth the trip to Georgia,“ he said. “But the bare, bare minimum would be, as we have all said, a full-throated call for modifying the filibuster rules.”Some advocates want Biden to more firmly back Schumer’s call to hold a vote before Jan. 17 on carving out a voting rights exception to the filibuster. Advertisement     “We need Biden to demand that that vote happens this week,” Woodall said.He wants Biden to “call Manchin and Sinema out directly” for holding up the legislation.Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said she will attend the president's and vice president's speeches because she sees it as an opportunity to ground the push for the voting rights legislation in ""the cradle of the civil rights movement.""""I represent a district that was once held by Congressman John Lewis,"" she said. ""And I am going because it's imperative to me that the White House, specifically the president and the vice president, show that we have the full weight of the White House behind creating a path forward with the filibuster to get voting rights passed.""One major national civil rights group, the NAACP, did not join the local groups’ denunciation of the president’s visit — rather, its members will be watching closely in the days after the address for the president to push changes to the filibuster and then the voting rights bills, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told BuzzFeed News.Johnson said he’s seen the administration “muscle through and pass” other legislation like COVID relief, the debt ceiling raise, the infrastructure bill, and unemployment tax.“Placing the priority on the policy issues isn't about words, it is about outcomes. And we have yet to have an outcome of voting rights protections over a year,” he said.He said he does understand Georgia civil rights groups not supporting Biden’s visit. “What they’re expressing is their frustration knowing how important this is,"" he said. “So as I’m listening intently tomorrow, I’ll be watching the following days.”As far as he’s concerned, though, “how to get there is irrelevant as long as they get there.”

Over her four decades, she's gone from a commoner to a member of the royal family — a massive change that we've decided to look back on in honor of her birthday.Catherine ""Kate"" Middleton was born on Jan. 9, 1982, to Carole Middleton, an airline steward, and Michael Middleton, a flight dispatcher. She met her future husband, Prince William, in 2001, when they both began their studies at St. Andrew's University in Scotland. The two became friends, and in their second year, Kate, William, and two other friends moved into an off-campus apartment together. They started dating in 2003 — reportedly after William was entranced by Kate modeling a revealing dress in a charity fashion show. Although they broke up in 2007, the two were soon back together and William proposed marriage in 2010. Their royal wedding on April 29, 2011, was watched by tens of millions of people around the world. William and Kate are now the parents of three children and preparing for their roles as the future Prince and Princess of Wales — and, eventually, king and queen consort.

The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan (Simon & Schuster)In the near future, the government's surveillance system has turned its eyes on mothers, scrutinizing women's behavior with dire consequences for any and every mistake. When 39-year-old Chinese American mom Frida Liu has one very bad day, her 18-month-old Harriet is taken away to live with Frida's ex-husband and his annoying girlfriend. To win her custody rights back, Frida must pass a yearlong course on how to be a good mother. Forced to live in prison-like conditions, Frida is given a robot doll modeled after her daughter to practice her mothering skills on. If Frida speaks out about the school's conditions or even questions policies, her record will be permanently marked, and she won't be able to see her daughter again. This devastating dystopian novel presents an honest glimpse into the difficulties of parenthood while calling out the culture of policing parents.Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan (Harper Voyager; Jan. 11)This debut fantasy based on the Chinese myth of the moon goddess, Chang'e, is as beautiful as its cover.

However, saving her and her daughter's life has a cruel cost — the celestials exile her to the moon for taking her husband’s elixir, ensuring that she can never leave and never see her husband again. She keeps her daughter, Xingyin, a secret from the celestials. Xingyin grows up suppressing her magic so the celestials won't notice her, but she's forced to flee her moon home when the celestials catch on that something isn't quite right on the moon.

It opens with two orphaned sisters hiring a boat owner to take them into a dangerous jungle at night so they can beg a favor of a goddess, the Lady of the Seraphine. Celestia asks the Lady to grant her a wealthy and kind husband to help the sisters’ farm thrive, but the Lady exacts a price. At some point in the future, she will require a favor of the sisters and the boat owner, and they must repay the debt, or else. Five years later, the kingdom is on the brink of war and disease is rampant, but Celestia and her sister Izara are thriving. Celestia is pregnant, and Izara is studying to be a mage. When the emperor calls Celestia’s husband away for a secret mention, the Lady of the Seraphine calls in her debt, and her demands put everything the sisters have worked toward at risk.Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi (Tordotcom; Jan. 25)This complex dystopia takes place 30 years into a future where Earth has been decimated by climate change. The wealthiest have fled and live in space colonies, leaving those without the means to escape struggling to find some kind of normalcy in a crumbling infrastructure and environment. Jonathan and David are white men who decide to leave their space colonies and return to Earth. As they begin to rebuild in New Haven, Connecticut, their white privilege is in sharp contrast to the Black existence in New Haven. While Jonathan and David idealize their return to Earth, the laborers Linc, Bishop, and Sydney — who salvage buildings for space colonies to use — are just trying to survive the radiation poisoning, street violence, gentrification, and the general inhumanity in how they’re forced to live. With interweaving timelines and characters, this is a dense read that, like the best dystopias, critiques current political and social problems.Light Years from Home by Mike Chen (Mira; Jan. 25)Rich in character development, this literary science fiction centers on family drama in the wake of an alien abduction. Fifteen years ago, aliens took Jakob to become part of their military fleet, and his disappearance left his family in ruins. His dad became obsessed with finding him, and that obsession eventually led to his death. His younger sister, Evie, took over her dad's mission to find the truth and joined a UFO hunters group, becoming an integral member. Jakob's mother now has dementia, and his twin sister, Kass, takes care of her and doesn't believe for a second that aliens abducted Jakob. She believes her carefree, lazy brother is probably backpacking across Europe high on drugs, which is precisely what he tells his family when he reappears 15 years later.At The End of Everything by Marieke Nijkamp (Sourcebooks Fire; Jan. 25)The Hope Juvenile Treatment Center may claim to rehabilitate juvenile delinquents, but their treatment of the teens in their care is borderline abusive. When a plague sweeps the world, instead of informing the teenagers of the problem, the guards and every adult associated with the center abandon them, leaving them with very little food or medical supplies. When a group tries to leave the center, one of them is shot out of fear that they might be contagious. The defiant Grace is appointed as de facto leader of the center, while Leah, nonverbal and autistic, takes over food distribution after her twin sister is the first to come down with the plague. Emerson, a nonbinary violinist kicked out of their home by their strict Catholic parents, takes up the responsibility of burying the dead. This compulsive YA postapocalyptic novel shows how the ""problem"" teens society would rather forget can step up and make things better when given the respect they deserve.

She sees kings rise and fall and remembers everything. Her expansive memory serves as a threat to the chancellor and also contradicts Tracker’s version of events in Black Leopard.

69,"The Bronx fire comes just days after a fire at a Philadelphia apartment building that killed 12 people, eight of whom were children.","


Robert Durst, the multimillionaire who was the focus of the HBO documentary The Jinx and who was found guilty of murdering his friend, died on Monday at a hospital in California, his attorney said. He was 78 years old.Durst died at a hospital near Stockton where he had reportedly been taken for testing. In a statement, one of Durst's trial lawyers, Chip Lewis, said his death was associated with his ongoing health problems. Advertisement     ""We understand that his death was due to natural causes associated with the litany of medical issues we had repeatedly reported to the court over the last couple of years,"" he said.The New York Times reported that during his visit, he went into cardiac arrest and doctors were unable to revive him. In a statement, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Durst died of natural causes at 6:44 a.m. while being treated at an outside hospital. The San Joaquin County coroner will determine an exact cause of death.Durst, who was sentenced on Oct. 14 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, gained renewed notoriety in 2015 after seeming to confess to three murders that he’d been suspected of for years. His “confession” was made on The Jinx via a hot mic while in the bathroom after an incriminating interview for the show’s explosive finale.In the documentary, Durst is heard saying, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” But it was later revealed that filmmaker Andrew Jarecki had manipulated the line; “Killed them all, of course” actually preceded Durst saying, “What the hell did I do?” with several muttered remarks between them.Still, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on March 14, 2015, the day before the finale aired on HBO.
 


By the time the case reached trial, decades after Berman’s death and years after The Jinx, Durst was frail and in poor health. The pandemic then delayed the trial further, shutting down proceedings just days after opening arguments. Durst missed the reading of the verdict because of possible COVID exposure. He returned to court for sentencing only to test positive a day later for COVID himself. His attorney told the LA Times he had been placed on a ventilator.As late as justice came in Berman’s murder, Durst never faced consequences in the death that prosecutors alleged started it all. In making their case that Durst murdered Berman, prosecutors argued that he believed she was going to implicate him to police in the killing of his first wife, Kathleen “Kathie” McCormack Durst, in 1982. By finding Durst guilty of the special circumstances of killing a witness, the jury signaled that they believed prosecutors’ arguments that Durst had also killed Kathie Durst, whose body has never been found.
 


Though Durst had not yet been charged in Kathie Durst's disappearance or death, much of the Berman trial had focused on her case. In their victim impact statements, Berman's family pleaded with Durst to tell the McCormack family where they could find her body.“In telling where Kathie is,” said Sareb Kaufman, who was raised by Berman, “you can find some small redemption.”Durst never did. And in November, prosecutors in New York indicted him for murder in connection with Kathie Durst's disappearance.Durst was born in New York on April 12, 1943, the eldest son of real estate magnate Seymour Durst and Bernice Herstein. His mother died at age 32, after reportedly jumping from the roof of the three-story family home in Scarsdale. Durst, then 7 years old, would later claim he had seen his mother jump that night, an account that has been disputed by his family.After graduating from Lehigh University in 1965 with a degree in economics, Durst attended UCLA. There he met Berman; their friendship lasted decades, until he killed her in 2000.In 1973, Durst married Kathie Durst, who would go on to disappear in January 1982, when she was a fourth-year medical student at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Days after she was last seen alive, a woman claiming to be Kathie Durst called in sick to the dean of the school — a call that LA prosecutors said was made by Berman to cover for her friend. Durst did not report his wife missing for nearly a week.Although Durst was never charged, suspicion followed him for decades. In 1999, police in Westchester, New York, reopened the case.Feeling the pressure of a renewed investigation, in April 2001, Durst moved to Galveston, Texas, where he lived in a boarding house in disguise as a woman. On Sept. 30 of that year, the dismembered remains of his neighbor Morris Black washed up in Galveston Bay. Durst later admitted fatally shooting Black and chopping up his body, but he said the killing was the accidental result of a struggle over a gun. A Galveston jury found him not guilty based on his claims of self-defense.As he admitted on the witness stand in the recent trial, though, he couldn’t be trusted to tell the truth under oath.“I did not kill Susan Berman,” Durst said, which was a lie. “But if I had, I would lie about it.”

70,The Duchess of Cambridge’s life in 40 photos.,"Celebrities are mourning the loss of Bob Saget, who died yesterday. He was 65. On Sunday evening, the Orange County Sheriff's Office reported that Bob was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando. The cause of his death has not been confirmed, but officials said that there are no signs of foul play or drug use. “Earlier today, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room,” the officials wrote on Twitter. “The man was identified as Robert Saget and pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.” The legendary comedian and actor was perhaps best known for playing Danny Tanner on Full House in the '80s and '90s. He later reprised the role in 2016 for the show’s revival, Fuller House. Bob is survived by his wife, Kelly Rizzo, and three daughters — Aubrey, Lara, and Jennifer — who he shares with his first wife, Sherri Kramer. The comedian’s family issued a statement confirming the tragic news, spotlighting Bob's passion for performing live and “bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter.” “We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today. He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,” Saget’s family wrote. “Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world.” The news came shortly after he performed to a live audience on Saturday night in Jacksonville as part of his stand-up comedy tour. Several hours before his death, Bob tweeted about how much he’d loved that night’s show. Fellow comic, Pete Davidson, led tributes to the Full House star in the wake of his death. In a very rare public statement, Pete — who does not have his own social media accounts — spoke of Bob’s “kindness” and opened up about how the actor had helped him through struggles with his mental health. Pete's statement — which was shared on the Instagram account of his friend and fellow comic Dave Sirus — began with the 28-year-old describing Bob as ""one of the nicest men on the planet."" “When I was younger and several times throughout our friendship [Bob] helped me get through some rough mental health stuff,” the Saturday Night Live star said. “He stayed on the phone with my mom for hours trying to help in anyway he can — connecting us with doctors and new things we can try. He would check in on me and make sure I was okay,” he wrote. The statement concluded: “I love you Bob it was an honor to know you. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. My condolences to the family.” Like Pete, many other comedians spoke of Bob’s kindness, including Jim Carrey who praised his “big, big heart and wonderfully warped comic mind” in a tribute on Twitter. Fellow comics like Judd Apatow, Jon Stewart, Billy Crystal, Tiffany Haddish, Kathy Griffin, Chelsea Handler, and Ken Jeong also mourned the loss of their friend and colleague. A number of Full House actors have spoken out in memory of their costar, including the notoriously private Olsen twins. In a statement provided to People, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen — who shared the role of Michelle Tanner, first appearing on the show as infants — said they are “deeply saddened” by the death of their TV dad. “Bob was the most loving, compassionate and generous man. We are deeply saddened that he is no longer with us but know that he will continue to be by our side to guide us as gracefully as he always has,” the former child stars wrote in a joint statement. “We are thinking of his daughters, wife and family and are sending our condolences,” they added. Elsewhere, John Stamos — who famously played Uncle Jesse on the sitcom — expressed his “complete and utter shock,” telling fans he feels “broken” by the loss of his former castmate. “I am broken. I am gutted,” the actor wrote on Twitter. “I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.” Other Full House alumni like Dave Coulier and Candace Cameron Bure also shared tributes on Twitter. The latter — who played Bob’s eldest TV daughter, DJ Tanner — wrote that Bob was “one of the best human beings” she’d ever known. Despite Bob’s generation-spanning performances on Full House and Fuller House, he was better known to some for his essential role in How I Met Your Mother. Across all nine seasons of the hit sitcom, Bob lent his voice to the future version of Ted Mosby, who narrated each episode. Josh Radnor — who played Ted — shared a heartfelt thread of tweets to celebrate the life of the man who voiced his older self for nearly a decade. “We had a very special bond from Day 1, were never out of touch for long,” Josh wrote. “We found a way to grab dinner once a year, even after HIMYM wrapped. We went to see each other in our Broadway plays. We talked a lot about how to live a meaningful life amidst all the chaos.” He concluded the thread by expressing his gratitude for Bob’s friendship: “I’m endlessly grateful that HIMYM brought Bob Saget into my life. I’ll hear his voice in my head for the rest of my days.” Neil Patrick Harris — who played Barney Stinson on HIMYM — joined his costar in mourning the loss, describing Bob as “kind and generous and hilarious.” As well as those who worked with Bob on a professional basis, a number of his friends across the showbiz industry have penned moving tributes — including John Mayer, who was known to be an especially close friend to the actor. In a short but heartfelt statement on Instagram, John wrote: “I love you, Bob. I will never forget you. I will visit you often in my memories, and I hope I get to see you in my dreams. I will tell my kids about you. I’m taking you with me forever. I love you, Bob.” Other celebrities who've shown love for the beloved comedian include Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Martin, Andy Cohen, and BJ Novak."

Needless to say: Warning! There will be many spoilers for Spider-Man: No Way Home ahead!


 


If you didn’t know, the game Werewolf involves a group of people, some of whom are secret “werewolves” tasked with hiding their identity from the others. “Like anyone who’s played the game Werewolf knows, if you are the werewolf your heart kind of sinks because you know you have a stressful couple of hours ahead of you,” Andrew went on. “You’re gonna have to lie to your friends’ faces and try to convince them that you are not the bad guy in the game... But it was thrilling, actually.”
 


“I placed myself in that position of, ‘Well, what would I want to know? Would I want to be toyed with? Would I want to be lied to? Would I want to be kept on my toes guessing? Would I want to discover it when I went to the theater? Would I want to be guessing, guessing, guessing?’” he said. Advertisement     Refuting his own concerns, Andrew said: “I would want the actor to do an incredibly good job at convincing me he wasn’t in it. And then I would want to lose my mind in the theater when my instinct was proven right. That’s what I would want.”
 


“I worked so hard to keep it a secret that I was in Atlanta shooting,” he said. “All these leaks were happening, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, guys, what the hell is going on? I’m working so hard here to stay secret, and then here’s an image of me with Tobey!’ And they’re like, ‘No, no, we’re gonna keep it quiet.’ ‘OK, I’ll keep denying it.’
 


“It’s been a rare experience to play that mass game of Werewolf with every single Spider-Man fan in the world,” he concluded.
 


For context: In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Andrew's Peter Parker failed to save his love interest Gwen Stacy, who dies after falling from the clock tower. In No Way Home, however, he manages to save MJ from a similar fall — something that he called “a second chance at saving Gwen.” Advertisement     
 


“It was joyful, and a feeling of closure for me. There was so many unanswered questions for my Peter, where we left it. I got to step back in and get some healing for him,” he said.

72,Convicted murderer Robert Durst has died at 78. The multimillionaire was the focus of The Jinx documentary.,"If Julia Fox wasn’t on your radar in 2021 then I’m pretty sure she is in 2022 thanks to her and Kanye West’s very public new romance, which she confirmed in a detailed blog post last week. Kanye — who legally changed his name to Ye last year — had spent the weeks prior to meeting Julia begging his ex-wife Kim Kardashian to take him back after she filed for divorce in February, following six years of marriage. But after his efforts proved fruitless, he moved on with Uncut Gems actor Julia over New Year — and if the revelation that Ye surprised her with a “hotel suite full of clothes” on their second date wasn’t intense enough, it has now transpired that Julia considers herself a “die-hard, OG” fan of the Kardashians and admitted just two weeks before meeting Ye that she wanted to be a part of the family. To recap, Ye first broke his silence on his and Kim’s split in November, where he insisted he’d “never seen the divorce papers” in an episode of the Drink Champs podcast. He continued to make a string of similar claims that suggested he and Kim would reunite, before publicly begging his ex to take him back live onstage at his and Drake’s ""Free Larry Hoover"" concert in December. Reworking the lyrics of his 2010 hit “Runaway,” Ye repeatedly sang: “I need you to run right back to me, baby,” before adding, “more specifically, Kimberly.” The very next day, on Dec. 10, Kim submitted a request to court to be declared “legally single,” citing that “no counseling or reconciliation effort” can fix their marriage, and that Ye had not responded to multiple requests to officially “terminate” the relationship. She is rumored to have moved on with Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson, whom she was first linked to in October and jetted to the Bahamas with last week. After Kim’s petition to be “legally single” was filed, Ye reportedly decided to start “embracing the single life” as he was spotted in the company of various different women over the holiday season. But only one of the beauties managed to stick, with Julia and Ye embarking on a whirlwind romance after they met in Miami on New Year’s Eve. On Jan. 6, Julia confirmed that they are officially dating in a blog entry for Interview magazine, which recounted their relationship so far alongside a slew of very intimate photographs of the new couple. Confirming that they’d first met less than one week earlier, Julia wrote: “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night.” She added that they’d then flown to New York to watch a play before going for dinner at her favorite restaurant, where Ye took it upon himself to direct a photo shoot, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines, she said. And when the pair returned to their hotel suite, Julia found that Ye had filled it with racks of new clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” But fans were quickly struck with an eerie sense of déjà vu, recalling that Ye used a similar tactic to reinvent Kim at the very start of their relationship. Once they officially started dating in 2012, Ye decided to give Kim’s wardrobe and style a complete overhaul — famously reducing her to tears as he threw away any items that he didn’t approve of and presented her with a pile of new designer clothes. And this is all information that Julia is most likely aware of, considering she is a hardcore fan of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, where Kim has frequently spoken about Ye's behavior. In fact, Julia discussed her obsession with Kim’s entire family on her Forbidden Fruits podcast on Dec. 18 — two weeks before her and Ye’s fateful first meeting. Julia revealed that she can remember the exact moment Kim and Ye announced their divorce earlier in the year, and enthusiastically asked her cohost Niki Takesh: “Can we talk about the Kim and Kanye divorce? Wait, can we talk about Kim and Pete Davidson, though?” She and Niki go on to call themselves “OG, die-hard Kardashian fans” as they discussed the E! show coming to an end in June last year, with Julia admitting: “I’m gonna miss Keeping Up. I’ve been watching Keeping Up since it first came out in 2007, like when watching it was embarrassing. I like, wanted them to be my family.” Niki went on to add: “No, they are my family — I’m the biggest Kardashian stan and have been since 2007, nothing can stop that. It’s not even like, Oh my god, I’m obsessed with them. I don’t know how to explain my obsession with them.” Julia shared her agreement before musing: “You feel like you know them. It’s a different relationship, a deeper one, it’s like you’re happy for them when something good happens.” The pair then discussed Khloé Kardashian’s romance with Tristan Thompson, with Julia calling her “sensitive and kind” after recalling: “I remember watching the last season and she wasn’t back with Tristan yet in public; she wanted another baby but doing it with his sperm and her eggs. It’s like, babe, it’s OK — your kids don’t need to have the same father. Go find some good fucking guy.” And Julia's self-proclaimed love for all things Kardashian could explain why she's been recently caught liking several of Kim's Instagram posts while dating Ye. Julia follows Ye's ex on the social media platform, and eagle-eyed fans spotted her name under the likes for many of Kim’s posts — most recently a photo of Kim walking out of a hotel, which she shared four days ago alongside the caption: “The best is yet to be.” And if things go well between her and Ye, then Julia might just get her wish of being a part of Kim’s family — or at least stepmom to her kids."

The Orange County Sheriff's Office also confirmed that ""deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room. The man was identified as Robert Saget & pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case."" An accomplished comedian and actor, Saget was best known for his role as Danny Tanner in the sitcom Full House, which ran for eight seasons from 1987 to 1995. He also hosted America's Funniest Home Videos during the show's most iconic era, and he provided the voice for the ""future"" Ted Mosby on How I Met Your Mother. Even though Saget was associated with plenty of family-friendly media, he was equally known for his stand-up comedy, which mostly veered into adult-oriented territory. He also had a notorious cameo in the 1998 stoner comedy classic Half Baked. You can watch it below. Saget stayed in the public eye in the years leading up to his death — even appearing on The Masked Singer's fourth season, in which he competed as the ""Squiggly Monster."" At the time of his passing, Saget was on a stand-up tour that last stopped in Jacksonville, Florida. ""I had no idea I did a 2 hr set tonight,"" he tweeted early Sunday morning before promoting his upcoming 2022 dates. ""I'm happily addicted again to this shit."""

At least 17 people, eight of them children, have died and dozens are hospitalized in critical condition following a ""horrific"" apartment-complex fire in the Bronx, New York City officials said.The fire was caused by a malfunctioning electric space heater in a residence that spanned two floors of the apartment complex, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a press conference Sunday night. When those living in the apartment fled, they left the doors open, allowing smoke from the blaze to escape throughout the building. New York passed a law requiring large apartment buildings to have self-closing doors following an earlier deadly fire in the Bronx; it wasn't immediately clear how the door was able to remain open Sunday. Advertisement     ""The door to that apartment — unfortunately when the residents left — was left open; it did not close by itself,"" Nigro said. ""The smoke spread throughout the building, thus the tremendous loss of life and people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx.""He added that the fire was contained, and smoke alarms in the building were operable.Officials initially said 19 people had died, but revised the number to 17 in a Monday press conference.
 


The fire broke out in the 19-story Twin Parks apartment building on East 181st Street at approximately 11 a.m.It was classified as a five-alarm fire, the most serious and dangerous category of blazes. Nigro said that more than 200 firefighters responded to the scene within minutes of the fire being reported.In the immediate aftermath, the fire commissioner confirmed 63 injuries, 32 of which required hospitalization.""This fire took its toll on the city,"" he said
 


Nigro added that given the number of people with serious injuries, the blaze was ""unprecedented in our city."" Firefighters ""found victims on every floor"" in cardiac and respiratory distress due to smoke inhalation, he said. Advertisement     Newly elected Mayor Eric Adams described the fire as ""a horrific, horrific, painful moment.""""The impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of pain and despair in this city,” Adams told the press. “This is going to be one of the worst fires we have witnessed in the city of New York in modern times.”Adams said that individuals affected by the fire who request government aid will not be turned over to immigration officials, regardless of their residency status. He said that many of those who lived in the building are Muslim immigrants from Gambia.""If you need assistance, your names will not be turned over to ICE or any other institution. We want people to be comfortable in coming forward, and it's imperative that we connect with those on the ground to make sure they get that message and that word out,"" Adams said.Camber Property Group, the organization that owns the building, said in a statement to the New York Times that they were ""devastated"" by the ""unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy.""""We are cooperating fully with the Fire Department and other city agencies as they investigate its cause, and we are doing all we can to assist our residents. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.”The Bronx fire comes mere days after a fire at a Philadelphia apartment building that killed 12 people, eight of whom were children. The cause of that blaze remains under investigation, but the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that authorities believe a 5-year-old playing with a lighter set a Christmas tree on fire.BuzzFeed News reporter Kadia Goba contributed to this story.

The royal family on Sunday released three new official portraits of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton), to mark her 40th birthday.The photos, taken by Italian fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, were captured in London's Kew Gardens in November 2020. The future queen consort is wearing custom-made gowns from British fashion house Alexander McQueen, which also designed her 2011 wedding dress. Advertisement     According to the BBC, the three portraits will at first go on display in locations across the UK ""with special meaning"" to the duchess before being permanently housed at the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is a patron. One image will hang in Berkshire, where the duchess was born and spent her childhood. The other will go to St. Andrews in Scotland, where Kate and William attended college and where they met. The third will go to Anglesey, where the royal couple lived immediately after their wedding.
 


Roversi, who is based in Paris, told the Guardian that working with Kate was a ""true honor"" and ""a moment of pure joy.""“I was moved by her warmth and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul, and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. Advertisement     “It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world.”Four other portraits by Roversi are already on display in the National Portrait Gallery.
 


The pictures — two monochrome and one in color — show Kate in both casual and formal poses. The Queen loaned the duchess a pair of diamond earrings for the color portrait; she wears earrings that belonged to her mother-in-law, Princess Diana, in the others.In a tweet Sunday, Kate thanked the photographer and the National Portrait Gallery for the images and expressed her appreciation for the birthday wishes.

A Chinese immigrant who was violently attacked months ago in New York City has died of his injuries, police said Saturday.Yao Pan Ma, 61, had been collecting bottles and cans in East Harlem on April 23, 2021, when a 49-year-old man ambushed him, knocking him to the ground and repeatedly kicking him in the head, leaving him bloodied and brutalized. In the months since, Ma had been in a coma and on a ventilator and was moved to hospice care in November, a spokesperson for his family previously told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     Shortly after the incident, Jarrod Powell, 49, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault as a hate crime. During a deposition, Powell claimed a “Korean” man and a “Japanese” guy had robbed him, but “did not provide any details relating to the description of the perpetrators of the alleged robbery other than that they were Asian,” court records state.Following Ma's death on Dec. 31, the attack is being treated as a homicide, police said.Ma and his wife emigrated from China to the US in Nov. 18 and moved in with her parents in Harlem after losing their Chinatown apartment to a fire, the family's spokesperson said. Back in China, where the couple's children and grandchildren remained, Ma had been a talented chef. In New York, he got a job cooking and washing dishes at a restaurant in Chinatown, but lost it when the pandemic shuttered restaurants across the city.The family struggled to make ends meet after that; Ma did not qualify for unemployment benefits, and his in-laws received less than $1,000 in Social Security income. To support all four of them, Ma and his wife began collecting empty bottles and cans, living off the 5-cents-apiece refunds. Advertisement     After he was attacked while gathering the recyclables, Ma's wife was too afraid to go out and continue doing so. She found work as a home health aide for a time but is now unemployed again. During her visits to the hospital to see her husband, she would play Chinese opera music for him, uncertain but hopeful he might be able to hear it.Ma is one of the many victims in a wave of anti-Asian violence that has swept the US during the pandemic. Like him, a number of older Asian people, many of them immigrants, have been severely injured or even killed in similar unprovoked beatings. In March, six Asian women were killed in a string of shootings at spas in Georgia.According to a recent report by the organization Stop AAPI Hate, there have been more than 10,000 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in the US since March 2020, 16% of which were physical assaults.

In Ho’s debut book of fiction, two childhood best friends growing up in Los Angeles fall in and out of love, navigate relationships with estranged family members, and deal with casual racism in these linked short stories about friendship over time. —Tomi Obaro Advertisement     
 


A frazzled single mother leaves her child alone at home for a few hours only to run into trouble with the state, which sends her to an institution to teach her how to sufficiently love her daughter in this buzzy debut novel about the pressures of modern motherhood. —T.O. Advertisement     
 


The author of A Little Life returns with yet another doorstopper (To Paradise is a whopping 720 pages). Set in three alternative versions of the US, the novel focuses primarily on three characters, two of whom have the same name. The first section is a queer Edith Wharton–esque tale of a young man named David who agrees to an arranged marriage to an older man even though he’s in love with someone else. In the second section, a character also named David lives in 1993 Manhattan during the AIDS epidemic and cares for his ailing older partner while avoiding anything to do with his father and his family back in Hawaii. The third section centers on a woman trapped in a dystopian future, still reeling from the effects of a devastating pandemic. —T.O.
 


In 2016, Schulz’s father died, mere months after meeting her partner and eventual wife for the first time. In three sections, “Lost,” “Found,” and “And,” Schulz muses about the mundanity of grief, the rapture of true love, and the queasy coexistence of both forces at the same time. I read a galley of this book over the holidays and couldn't stop thinking about its deep insight into the fleeting beauty of existence. —T.O.
 


Disclosure: Attenberg is an acquaintance of mine who blurbed my own upcoming book, but even if she were a total stranger, I know I would have enjoyed this memoir. Attenberg, the author of the bestseller The Middlesteins and six other works of fiction, turns to nonfiction for the first time with this autobiography about her dogged commitment to writing. From growing up as an awkward adolescent in suburban Chicago to having a traumatizing experience in college to gallivanting from apartment to apartment in Seattle and Williamsburg, she writes about charting her way through adulthood unconventionally, wedded only to her art. —T.O.
 


The author of 2017’s deadpan debut Chemistry returns to bookshelves with this similarly offbeat story of an ICU doctor dealing with the aftermath of her father’s death. Joan is an extremely competent but somewhat antisocial thirtysomething working at a hospital in New York City. When her father dies of a stroke in China, she takes 48 hours off to attend the funeral and then is back to work. But a mandatory wellness break forces Joan to spend time with her mother and brother. Wang’s sense of humor makes this both a page-turner and a poignant reflection on the familial ruptures caused by immigrating. —T.O.
 


Morrison’s only published short story is reissued here with an illuminating foreword by Zadie Smith. Recitatif centers on two girls of different races, Roberta and Twyla, who are sent to a state shelter. Crucially, though, we are never told who is Black and who is white. Like much of Morrison’s work, this story is a deceptively simple and intricate indictment of the ludicrousness of racism. —T.O. Advertisement

Heti’s breakthrough novel, 2010’s How Should a Person Be?, influenced countless writers and set the stage for our current autofiction boom. Her latest once again breaks the mold of what a novel can be. The plot and setting are abstract; God creates three kinds of people: bird, fish, and bear, the first of which spawns Mira, the protagonist we follow throughout the novel. But questions that have shown up in Heti’s prior work, namely around the problems of living and what it means to be an artist, are still very much at the center. —Karolina Waclawiak

Before Beyoncé tapped this Somali British poet to write the poetry for her visual album Lemonade, Shire was already a prolific writer, with two chapbooks, Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth and Her Blue Body, under her belt. Now she’s publishing her first full-length poetry collection, which focuses, like much of her work, on the trauma of forced migration, familial violence, and secrets. This is a collection that merits slow and careful reading. —T.O.
 


Inspired by Robert Mugabe’s fall from power in 2017 and George Orwell’s classic fable Animal Farm, Bulawayo satirizes the dysfunctional politics that curse so many African nations in this long-awaited sophomore effort after her 2013 Booker finalist debut, We Need New Names. —T.O.

In this inventive debut, a disparate group of social outcasts get by in the city of Lagos, even as the criminalization of homosexuality dampens their ability to live freely. Some characters are humans, others are spirits, others seem to shift between the two. Like the work of fellow Nigerian writers Lesley Nneka Arimah and Akwaeke Emezi (who incidentally blurbed this book), these stories eschew strict realism for magical writing in both the literal and figurative sense. —T.O.
 


Vuong’s second full-length poetry collection grapples with the aftermath of his mother’s death in poems that memorably evoke the stunning immensity of loss. —T.O.
 


Picking up where her 2010 Pulitzer-winning collection A Visit From the Goon Squad left off, Egan once again hopscotches characters, countries, and years in this book about a technological invention called Own Your Unconscious that allows people to upload their memories to the cloud. The privacy implications of such an idea prompt a swift backlash. Using the inventiveness that made A Visit From the Goon Squad such a delight, Egan delivers another formally creative novel. —T.O.
 


Mandel has always excelled at drawing connections between disparate characters who seem, at first glance, utterly unrelated to each other. Sea of Tranquility is arguably her most ambitious book yet in that regard. A teenager sets sail for the wilds of Canada, a novelist lives in a moon colony, and a detective investigates a series of crimes in the ominously named Night City. Science fiction lovers will not be disappointed. —T.O.
 


Painful cramps and mood swings have always been integral components of Caldwell’s periods. But in her 30s, the symptoms appear to worsen. When the mood swings begin to threaten her burgeoning romantic relationship, Caldwell gets a medical diagnosis that confirms she has premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Armed with this information, she talks to different people about their own painful periods while also charting her experiences with love and the pressures on women in their 30s to “settle down.” —T.O.
 


Though my relationship with Abdelmahmoud, my BuzzFeed News colleague, could perhaps best be described as “gently antagonistic,” I can’t say enough nice things about his debut book. Son of Elsewhere is described as “memoir in pieces,” and indeed it gives gorgeous if sometimes brutal flashes from Abdelmahmoud’s life. Each essay covers a wide range — stories about Blackness, immigration, fatherhood, wrestling fanfiction, war, and the glory of suburban Canadian highways— but his writing always pulls you in and makes you stay, even if it’s painful, even if it hurts. —Scaachi Koul
 


In the follow-up to Batuman’s 2017 novel The Idiot, a Pulitzer finalist, Selin, a Harvard undergraduate in a confusing situationship with a grad student named Ivan, is entering her sophomore year. She’s still naively confounded by the ways of the adult world and seeks solace in fiction, even as Ivan’s ex and the technological advances of the ’90s bear down. —T.O.
 


Perrotta brings back his iconic character Tracy Flick for his newest novel. Set in the #MeToo era, the book explores themes of redemption and forgiveness as Flick finds herself back in high school, but this time navigating power dynamics as a single mother and assistant principal vying for the newly vacated top spot. Chock-full of unforgettable characters and Perrotta’s signature wit and pathos, this is a welcome return to a world rife with complex moral dilemmas. —K.W.

This marvelous debut novel from Obaro, BuzzFeed News’ deputy culture editor, follows the decadeslong friendship of Enitan, Zainab, and Funmi as they prepare for the lavish wedding of Funmi’s daughter, Destiny. Set in Nigeria, the story begins as the friends are reunited in the present day before delving into how they first met. Against the backdrop of student protests in the 1980s, these very different women forge bonds that are tested by love affairs and tragedy. It’s an unforgettable and complex portrait of female friendship. —K.W.
 


The former BuzzFeed Books founder’s intimate debut essay collection spans Fitzgerald’s childhood in Boston, precarious adolescence in rural Massachusetts, class-defined high school years in a wealthy boarding school, and adulthood in San Francisco while tackling timely topics like masculinity and body image, class, addiction, and what we inherit from our parents. Equal parts illuminating and poignant, Fitzgerald’s essays attempt to untangle what it means to be a man in this world and in his own body. —K.W.
 


Hamid’s latest novel following the success of 2017’s Exit West is a Kafkaesque mindbender. One day, a man named Anders discovers that his skin has turned dark and he no longer recognizes himself.

80,The three new portraits of the Duchess of Cambridge will go on display around the UK and then hang in the National Portrait Gallery.,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019. Advertisement     I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends.“That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing. Advertisement     Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake. Advertisement     “It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

83,"brb, unfollowing everyone","Welcome to the next chapter of the Kimye divorce saga, starring Julia Fox. The 31-year-old actor — who is best known for her breakout performance in Adam Sandler’s Uncut Gems — appears to have bagged herself the highly coveted role of the newest muse of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West). If you’re wondering how we got here, you’re not alone. Allow me to explain. So, if you’ve been ~keeping up~ with Kim Kardashian West and Ye over the past few months, you’ll be well aware that Ye has made no secret of the fact that his sights have been firmly set on a reunion. While Kim was hanging out with her rumored beau, Pete Davidson, Ye pretty much spent the entire month of November publicly begging for her to reconsider their divorce. In fact, even as recently as Dec. 9, the father of four was proudly singing for his soon-to-be-ex-wife to “run right back” to him while performing on stage in front of 70,000 people. In light of this, fans were left understandably shocked after the rapper was spotted hanging out with a number of different women over the course of the festive period. Reportedly “embracing the single life,” Ye spent time partying in Belize, Houston, and eventually Miami, where he celebrated over the New Year weekend. Which is where we meet Julia Fox. The duo were first linked after they stepped out for dinner in Miami on New Year’s Day. And despite reports at the time that the date was “nothing serious,” Julia and Ye were spotted on a second outing just a few days later. After relocating to New York City for their next date — which involved a Broadway show and another romantic dinner — Page Six reported that the two were officially dating. And now, putting any speculation to rest, Julia confirmed the romance herself in a blog entry she wrote for Interview Magazine on Jan. 6 — less than one week after we’re told they first met. The brief but detailed article — which is accompanied by a slew of very intimate images of the two — begins with Julia explaining that, as we presumed, she and Ye first met in Miami on New Year’s Eve, right before their first date on Jan. 1. “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night,” she wrote, before going on to explain how they wound up in NYC days later. “We decided to keep the energy going and fly back to New York City to see Slave Play,” she revealed. “Ye’s flight landed at six and the play was at seven and he was there ON TIME. I was impressed.” “After the play we chose to do dinner at Carbone which is one of my favorite restaurants. Obviously,” she added. Julia also explained that — in true Ye style — the Yeezy founder took it upon himself to direct a photoshoot inside the restaurant, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines. “At the restaurant, Ye directed an entire photo shoot for me while people dined! The whole restaurant loved it and cheered us on while it was happening,” she said. And if the impromptu photoshoot wasn’t strange enough, here’s where things start to get a little weird. The Uncut Gems star went on to reveal that after finishing up with dinner, the two headed back to a hotel suite which had been packed out with racks of clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” “I don’t know how he did it, or how he got all of it there in time. But I was so surprised. Like, who does things like this on a second date? Or any date!” she concluded. If you read that passage and felt a sudden pang of déjà vu, that’s probably because we’ve seen this scenario before. Despite Julia’s evident surprise at the gesture, Ye used a similar tactic once before to woo (or rather, reinvent) Kim Kardashian at the start of their relationship. If you need reminding, Ye took it upon himself to lead a complete overhaul of Kim’s image shortly after they officially started dating in 2012. Starting with her style, Ye called upon the help of his stylist, who assisted him in updating Kim’s entire closet, disposing of anything they didn’t like and replacing it with ~Ye-approved~ items. After reportedly throwing out over 250 pairs of shoes — and reducing Kim to tears in the process — Ye presented her with an entirely new wardrobe filled with designer clothes he’d picked out to inaugurate the new-and-improved Kim. Nearly a decade later — the 250 pairs of lost shoes now ancient history — and Ye has literally been credited with “revolutionizing” Kim’s style and overall image. Which prompts the question: Is history about to repeat itself? Interestingly, even before Julia revealed that he had surprised her with the new clothes, some fans were already speculating that Ye had been styling her for their dates. Sporting a number of Balenciaga ensembles, Julia’s date night attire was suspiciously reminiscent of the countless looks from the same designer that we’ve come to expect from Kim over recent months. Clearly unfazed by the Kim K comparisons, Julia closed out her Interview Mag post by hinting that she’s excited for the future of her relationship with Ye. “Everything with us has been so organic,” she told readers. “I don’t know where things are headed but if this is any indication of the future I’m loving the ride.” Like Julia, we also can’t predict where the future will take this unlikely duo. But, if Ye's generous wardrobe donation is anything to go by, there's a chance he could be in it for the long run."

85,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative. Advertisement     But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus.But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly. Advertisement     Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk. Advertisement     Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

Oprah Winfrey, Barack Obama, and Lenny Kravitz are among the figures who have paid homage to the life of Sidney Poitier following the news of his death at the age of 94.Poitier, the first Black man to win an Oscar, was declared the ""last of the Great Trees"" to fall by Winfrey, who posted a photo of the two together. Advertisement     ""I treasured him. I adored him. He had an enormous soul I will forever cherish. Blessings to Joanna and his world of beautiful daughters,"" Winfrey wrote.
 


Oscar winner Viola Davis recalled a dinner with Poitier and described his impact on her life as radical.""The dignity, normalcy, strength, excellence and sheer electricity you brought to your roles showed us that we, as Black folks, mattered!!!"" wrote Davis before she shared some famous words of wisdom Poitier once gave.""You told us, 'If your dreams do not scare you, they're not big enough'! I put this quote on my daughter's wall.""
 


""I am because of him,"" actor Colman Domingo wrote on Twitter.
 


""There is no man in this business who has been more of a North Star for me than Sidney Poitier,"" actor and film executive Tyler Perry wrote.Perry shared his memories of a ""life changing"" trip to South Africa with Poitier alongside the late Cicely Tyson.""Selfishly, I wanted to hold them both captive for the hours long trip as I literally sat at their feet and listened to their wisdom and experiences,"" he recalled on Facebook.
 


Actor Billy Dee Williams described Poitier as a ""kind soul who changed the lives of so many, and a hero to all.""

A mom who went viral on TikTok for dancing next to her newborn as he received supplemental oxygen in a hospital said she posted the video just to share her son's health condition.""I would say the mistake I made was not giving enough context of the situation,"" the 28-year-old mom of two, Whitney Leavitt, told BuzzFeed News.The captions explained that her son Liam had been diagnosed with RSV, a common respiratory condition for which some infants need to receive oxygen via a nasal cannula. Advertisement     In the video, Leavitt dances next to her son as Kendrick Lamar's ""Love"" plays, hitting every beat.People online were confused and angry, insinuating that Leavitt was careless to dance beside her child in a hospital. The tabloids, including the Mail Online and the Sun, also picked up the story. A reposted video on Twitter has 4.7 million views.
 



 


""It was really bad, people were telling me to end my life, they wished my family would die,"" said Leavitt, who took down the video following the hate messages.She found out about the backlash on her second day in the hospital.""I felt like I had completely lost control to clear up the context of everything of why I made the video and the reason of what motivated me to make the video and I feel like people completely took it out of context,"" Leavitt said. Advertisement     She added that the reason she made the video was because people were asking about his condition while Liam was in the hospital and all her videos involve dancing.""Dancing and having captions answering a comment is in line with content I've always created,"" she said.
 


Leavitt's husband called her about the video going viral and said that it was everywhere. ""He was like, 'I think we need to take it down,' and it wasn't until that point that I looked it up and it had gone everywhere,"" she said.Like many people, Leavitt said she joined TikTok out of boredom from quarantining and started her account as something fun to do.At first, she began posting relatable mom content and memes. Then, when she got pregnant with her second child, Leavitt decided to start dancing again.
 


""I don't know why I didn't do this from the beginning because I enjoy it so much,"" she said.Leavitt danced at a competitive studio for years and then stopped when she became pregnant with her first child.She said that her second pregnancy was great and a lot different than the first one, which she found very hard. ""I wonder if dancing maybe helped — brought up my spirit,"" she added.Meanwhile, Liam is now doing great and doesn't need oxygen support.""He's awesome. He's healthy. He's sleeping horribly. But other than that, he's doing great,"" Leavitt said.
 


According to the Daily Dot, Leavitt's video got 1.6 million views before she took it down. Since then, the video has actually started a meme in which people dance to the same song with hypothetical situations.For example, there's one where someone dances with captions about their court date, or another where someone dances while the captions say they have been evicted because they didn't know they were supposed to pay rent every month. Advertisement     Leavitt wasn't aware that she'd started a mini trend, but she said that since the video hit the tabloids, she has started to think more about her content.""I don't want people to think that I didn't learn from this, because I definitely did,"" she said.

The three white men who chased down and fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery on a Georgia road were sentenced to life in prison Friday.Travis McMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole after the judge said their actions showed little remorse for the chilling murder of the 25-year-old Black man. Advertisement     ""This was a killing,"" Judge Timothy Walmsley said. ""It was callous.""Neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, but only after serving 30 years.Walmsley handed down the sentence after Arbery's parents and sister made their case for the harshest sentence, arguing that the three men killed him when they couldn't scare him away from their neighborhood.""This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the court. ""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community. And when they couldn't sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him."" Advertisement     Her comment appeared to have struck the judge, who cited the statement as he handed out the sentence for the three men.""He was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,"" he said.The McMichaels and Bryan were convicted of felony murder in November for the daytime killing that was captured on video. Arbery, 25, was shot on Feb. 23, 2020, in Brunswick, Georgia, while he was running on a two-lane road.The McMichaels had told police there had been break-ins in the neighborhood and that they began to chase Arbery in their truck. The men then confronted him. After a struggle with a shotgun, Travis fired at Arbery, killing him.Despite the footage and admissions from the three men that they had chased down Arbery before Travis McMichael shot and killed him, no arrests were made for more than two months. The leaking of the video drew public outrage and cast skepticism on how local authorities were handling the investigation. A former prosecutor handling the case has since been charged with violating her oath of office and obstructing the investigation.""These brutal crimes nearly went unpunished because of the deep corruption that pervades so many of our systems,"" said Ben Crump, an attorney representing Arbery's family. ""But because of the video, and the public cries for accountability, Ahmaud's killers have finally been held to account — first by the jury and in today's sentencing.""Prosecutors on Friday argued the three men should be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and Arbery's parents issued emotional pleas agreeing with the harshest sentence. Advertisement     ""When I close my eyes, I see his execution in my mind, over and over,"" Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, said. ""His killers should spend the rest of their lives thinking about what they did and what they took from us, and they should do it from behind bars because me and my family, we have to live with his death for the rest of their lives.""As he handed down his sentencing, Walmsley pointed out what he called ""chilling"" scenes from the video, which he said appeared to point to the defendants' demeanor immediately during and after the killing — factors he took into account in his decision.One of the scenes that stuck out in his mind, he said, was when Travis McMichael points the shotgun at Arbery.""When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles, and I kept going back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,"" Walmsley said.The judge said he was also struck by the moment in the video immediately after Arbery is shot.""After Ahmaud Arbery fell, the McMichaels turned their backs,"" he said. ""They walked away.""
 


Defense attorneys asked for a lighter sentence of life with the possibility of parole, pointing to the men's lack of criminal history and what they said were lives of community service before the 2020 killing. Advertisement     ""Greg McMichael is a good man,"" defense attorney Laura Hogue told the court, pointing out his service in the military and as an investigator with the prosecutor's office. ""He's not a perfect person, none of us are, but he's lived a good life, a life dedicated to service, and that does count for something.""Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, asked the court for an even lighter sentence than the mandatory minimum, arguing that, unlike the McMichaels, Bryan had expressed remorse over Arbery's death.""Whether it's part of the record or not, he expressed remorse over Mr. Arbery's death even before he was arrested on national television,"" Gough said. ""The Arbery family has not accepted that, and they don't have to, your honor, and we can understand why.""According to Gough, Bryan said that he wished he hadn't left his front porch and told one of the police officers he sometimes wished he had hit Arbery with his truck to prevent the shooting from taking place.But prosecutor Linda Dunikoski argued for all three to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, saying they were taking acts of vigilantism by arming themselves to confront Arbery.Dunikoski took issue in particular to Hogue comparing the men's actions to those of a neighborhood watch, telling the judge that members of a neighborhood watch are there to monitor and be good witnesses.""That's what neighborhood watch is supposed to be, not somebody running after people in a residential neighborhood,"" she said.She asked the judge, in handing down his decision, to take into account Travis McMichael's demeanor on the stand when he testified.""[Travis McMichael] said that was the worst day of his life,"" she said, raising her voice. ""Well, how did that work out for Ahmaud Arbery?""Greg McMichael, Dunikoski said, has at times used his past as a law enforcement officer for his defense and, at others, seemed to ignore his training and experience for actions that would benefit him. Advertisement     It was Greg McMichael who in May 2020, she said, took the video of the fatal shooting, gave it to his attorney, and leaked it, hoping it would help his case.She said he had ignored his law enforcement training and released evidence in an ongoing investigation.""He believed it was going to exonerate him,"" she said. ""He and his son believe they didn't do anything wrong, and that is a lack of remorse or empathy.""

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19, as the Omicron variant surges nationwide.US coronavirus cases are currently higher than they’ve ever been, averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily (itself an undercount), with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages, according to Walensky, who briefed reporters on Friday. More than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide. Advertisement     “While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group, pediatric hospitalizations are at the highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic,” Walensky said. “Sadly, we are seeing the rates of hospitalization increasing for children 0 to 4, children who are not yet currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.”As of Jan. 1, the rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations among children under 4 was 4.3 cases per 100,000. That’s almost four times higher than it is among kids 5 to 17, who are eligible for vaccination, according to Walensky, and more than twice the hospitalization rate seen in this age group at the same time last year. She added that CDC data does show that children above the age of 4 are more likely to be in the hospital if they are unvaccinated.Walensky pointed out that some unknown number of these cases are incidental — children who test positive when they are hospitalized for non-COVID reasons. Many of the case reports of children come from asymptomatic kids who enter the hospital for elective procedures or other illnesses, she added, complicating the picture for epidemiologists trying to figure out risks for kids.George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at UCSF, said these numbers show that COVID is widespread, is infecting children, and some proportion of them will be hospitalized. “Hospitalizations are going up. There's no reason to think that they wouldn't go up in children,” he said, adding that “children don't seem to be as unsusceptible to this as they have been to earlier strains.” Advertisement     But he thinks it’s too early to say that the proportion of infected children requiring hospitalization is growing nationally, partly because the CDC data is mostly from the northeastern region. Not knowing how many of these hospital cases are incidental makes the numbers even harder to interpret. “I've seen in London, where they actually do publish these data, that a third of COVID hospitalizations are incidental findings,” he added.Still, he said that COVID-19 is a serious disease for children, and protecting them while Omicron surges across the country is paramount.“In 2020 COVID was the seventh leading cause of death in children in the United States,” Rutherford said. “It is a big deal. And people who pooh-pooh it and say 'oh, it's no big deal' are blind to facts.”Masking in school and other indoor settings is helpful, he said, but what’s most important is for parents to try to ensure that everyone their child is in contact with is vaccinated and boosted (if they are eligible).It remains an open question whether Omicron is any more likely to lead to more severe disease in kids than other variants. This did not happen with Delta, Walensky said. “We are seeing a rise in hospitalizations, both because they are coming in with COVID but also because they're screening in for COVID,"" she said. ""[We] have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic.”Throughout the briefing, Walensky also defended the CDC against complaints that recent changes to protocols for isolating or quarantining after an infection, down to five days without symptoms, were confusing to the public or subject to disagreement from outside experts. Advertisement     “This virus has changed, and it's constantly throwing up curveballs,” Walensky said in response. As this virus changes, the CDC will have to change its guidance when working with state and local public health “to provide recommendations that are most feasible and can be implemented in communities across the country,” she said. “The past few weeks have been challenging for all of us.”

Advertisement     No one in the house, though, seems to be enjoying themselves. Throughout the show’s eight episodes, the members of the house are palpably distressed, consumed with the need to succeed while watching their peers soar to heights they know they might not achieve.Even Chase “Lil Huddy” Hudson, a founding member who has become a breakout star, is stressed. Credited with helping to start an emo revival among Gen Z, Hudson was signed by Interscope Records, and here he seems to realize he needs to leave his old friends behind to advance his music career. Hudson approaches this dilemma with the awkwardness of a first-year college student trying to dump his high school girlfriend during Thanksgiving break. It’s clear he wants to move on — he has moved out of the Hype House into his own mansion — but he’s very aware that his clout was a major factor in the group’s success. Without him, what do they have?“Chase is the person who made the Hype House what it was. Because he's not here, everything in this brand falls on me,” Petrou remarks in one scene, noting in another that Hudson could lift any member to new heights by just posting them on his page every once in a while, but doesn’t.The Hype House was started in late 2019 by Hudson and Petrou and at one point counted bonafide TikTok sensations like the D'Amelio sisters (Charli appears briefly in the series, but isn’t interviewed) and Addison Rae among its ranks. Today, though, many of the stars have moved on, leaving Petrou to lead a stable of less experienced and less famous creators. “Less famous” is all relative; everyone in the house has millions of followers on TikTok, but the remaining team does not enjoy the same recognition as its superstar alumni. Advertisement     “We were like a family… it was so much fun just creating content every day, and now times have changed,” Petrou laments, interspersed with nostalgic clips of old Hype House videos.This is a problem for Petrou, who is trying to keep the Hype House afloat financially. He’s having trouble motivating his posse of mostly indistinguishable white dudebros to contribute to the house’s bottom line (one scene cuts from Petrou lecturing the group about their laziness to a shot of one member throwing a potted plant at another’s sleeping form).While Petrou frets to the camera about working 10- to 12-hour days to fulfill the group’s brand partnership deals, which pay for everything in the house, members like Connor Yates, 23, and Michael Sanzone, 19, lounge around acting like, well, young people who have no adult supervision and very little responsibility. “I’m so bored!” Yates complains.Ironically, the interesting thing about the majority of the Hype House members, considering their popularity, is how boring they are to watch. The majority are so unmemorable that I couldn’t name most of them, and very few outside of Hudson and Petrou have a storyline over the course of eight episodes. They all blend together, a mass of white, good-looking young people lounging around the house, eating snacks in sweatpants, and occasionally doing pranks or generic dances on TikTok.Larray, a YouTuber and semi-involved Hype House member, explains in one scene why he no longer goes to the house as much. “The vibes don’t hit,” he says. Advertisement     Larray and fellow YouTube star Nikita Dragun (who is friends with many of the members) are by far the most watchable cast members, which is odd because Dragun’s not actually in the Hype House and neither of them found fame primarily on TikTok. They’re so peripheral to the collective that you have to wonder if production brought them in to make up for the dull Hype House crew (they are also, notably, the only POC on the show).The YouTubers could certainly carry a show by themselves. Dragun is compelling (that’s how she became so famous!), but it often feels like she’s on a totally different show. She discusses the ins and outs of running her makeup line, which she developed after failing to find products she wanted as a trans woman, and drives around Los Angeles in her fuschia sports car complaining about Trisha Paytas attacking her on Twitter. I could have watched hours more of just that. But this is Hype House — she eventually has to drag herself back there to do things with the crew. She gets the boys into makeup and heels, and though it’s not as entertaining as watching her cut loose, it’s a reprieve from the monotony of the uninspired TikTokers.
 


Larray, who is known for his YouTube comedy, is also a standout, discussing his rise to social media fame and how it has impacted his life. Larray is extremely dynamic on camera, with a unique presence. In one poignant scene, he discusses how he became estranged from his parents when he came out as gay. His own crew seems more tightly bonded than the Hype House’s, from his loving grandmother and aunt in Compton to his roommate Ravon, who used to be a fan and got Larray’s attention by posting a Carpool Karaoke–style video featuring a cutout of the YouTuber in the passenger seat. Advertisement     Meanwhile, the members of the house who do have storylines mostly made me sad. Vinnie Hacker, a creator who looks like he stepped out of an Abercrombie catalog, openly struggles. As Dragun describes it, Hacker is “extremely sexualized” on TikTok because of his hot bod, but he’s really just a gamer at heart who wants to go on Twitch rather than post thirst traps.The other two members who get substantial screentime are young couple Alex Warren and Kouvr Annon, both 20 and original Hype House members. Both Warren and Annon open up to the cameras about their tumultuous childhoods and the instability they experienced before finding each other and the Hype House. This history contextualizes Warren’s thrumming anxiety, which radiates off him every time he’s onscreen. He’s constantly talking about making sure he gets more views, how popular he is, and how to remain popular.This leads him to plan more and more ambitious prank videos, with middling results. In one attempt, Warren hurts his ankle and spends many subsequent scenes hobbling around. In another, sadder scene, he convinces Annon to hold a fake wedding for a video, which he is convinced will get a good amount of views. Annon is quietly crushed; she says she would marry Warren for real, but he makes it clear he’s only interested in a stunt wedding. Annon tells the cameras she's ready to have a family with Warren, even though she’s only 20. Aware of the mismatch, the rest of the house awkwardly proceeds with the fake nuptials.
 


“I think it's a little cruel to be to honest, but at the same time, like I guess anything for views,” Dragun quips. (Warren later admits the video didn’t perform the way he had hoped.)All of this highlights the central issue, which is that the Hype House is a shell of its former self. There’s a lot of pressure to perform well, and the TikTokers’ mental health seems to be affected by these expectations. Even Petrou’s Hail Mary attempt to reclaim the former magic — a big group trip to Joshua Tree, where they can all create together in a new setting — ends in disappointment. After a night of fighting and bad vibes, Petrou slumps to the ground outside. He recites the names of Hype House girls who have made it big: Charli, Dixie, Addison.“I wish that they ever talked to me,” he says.“I’m just so scared of having to go back to where I came from,” Petrou says (he also opens up in the show about having a difficult upbringing). Annon later tells Petrou the same fear drives Warren, who admits on camera to being “very depressed.”The drama unfolding in Hype House reminds me of the TikTok sound slash Taylor Swift lyric: “I think I’ve seen this film before, and I didn’t like the ending.” Content houses like the Hype House have been popular since YouTube celebrities became a thing, and they aren’t a guaranteed path to fame and fortune. Perhaps the most well known, Jake Paul’s Team 10, was also once the darling of the social media scene and it launched several stars; Petrou himself was even briefly a member. Advertisement     However, in the years since, the Team 10 house has been accused of being host to bullying and sexual assault, and Paul was accused of exploiting the members and taking their profits. The house was raided by the FBI in 2020 after Paul was investigated over the looting of an Arizona mall.But perhaps most relevant to the members of Hype House is that many Team 10 members have vanished into obscurity. Many still work in the industry, like Nick Crompton, who was able to parlay his Team 10 experience into becoming vice president of commercial innovation and artist strategy at Universal Music Group, and Alissa Violet, who works as an Instagram influencer. But their clout is mostly gone, and they have been supplanted by newer, shinier objects — mainly, well, the kids of the Hype House.At the end of the show, Petrou seems to be wrapping his mind around the fact that the Hype House may not be long for this world. “It just doesn’t work anymore; I think it’s just time to shut [the Hype House] down,” he says.
 


In the final episode, Petrou reveals many of the key members, including Annon and Warren, have moved out, although they are still in the collective. It still exists, but the dysfunction makes you think: Is the Hype House still here because of the Netflix show, and not the other way around?If I was conspiratorially minded, I would say it’s like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous. “I feel like a kid who has all the toys in the world, but no batteries to operate them,” says Petrou in the last episode, head in his hands. Every single Hype House member seems miserable, and you just want to give them a hug, a nice place to sleep, and a 24-hour social media break.Hype House is certainly an interesting insight into the machinations of content houses and the struggles that come with them, but it is not a very fun or interesting show. By the end, I was begging the Hype House to break up and end our misery — as well as theirs. ●

92,"""This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the court. ""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community.""","As any true Kardashian/Jenner fan would know, Kylie Jenner is due to give birth to her second child with Travis Scott any day now, after initially keeping her pregnancy a secret for months. However, many fans have now started to theorize that Kylie has actually given birth already — and they have the receipts to prove it. The theory — which immediately went extremely viral — bolstered other pregnancy clues spotted by fans, including the fact that Kylie’s birthday had been an uncharacteristically low-key affair and her recent reunion with former ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, which was seen as a way to repair the public’s perception of their relationship ahead of the news of a second pregnancy. Kylie went on to confirm the theories less than a month later, taking to Instagram to announce her pregnancy with a video charting its most special moments so far, alongside a caption tagging Travis. Now, the same TikTok user has done even more detective work and has come up with a new theory — that Kylie has already given birth and is keeping the news under wraps from the public. While the rest of her family were seen taking a shot with the host at the end of the show, Kylie turned away from the camera and did not consume the alcohol. Although the reunion didn’t air until June, Andy shared an Instagram video from the set on the date it was filmed — April 23. Emily points out that if Kylie already knew that she was pregnant by April 23, her due date would have been in the last week of December at the latest — meaning that baby number two should probably be here by now. And there’s further evidence to suggest that Kylie may have given birth weeks ago, starting with the Kar-Jenner’s famous Christmas Eve party on Dec. 24. Kylie opted to skip the annual bash and wasn’t seen in any of the photos, despite her 3-year-old daughter Stormi attending and being filmed alongside her cousins on Instagram. Interestingly, the toddler can be seen wearing a protective face mask in one of the brief clips that Khloé Kardashian shared to her story — the only family member to do so — suggesting that her household is taking particularly strict measures against COVID-19 at the moment, perhaps due to its vulnerable new addition. The plot thickened on Dec. 26, when Kourtney Kardashian’s fiancé, Travis Barker, shared a photo to his own social media page that had a pink-rimmed Comotomo newborn bottle in shot. Followers quickly realized that the current Kardashian/Jenner children are too old to be using this bottle, and some even noted that it was the same brand that Kylie used for Stormi when she was born. Kylie and Travis also used the holiday season to make a slow but carefully coordinated return to social media following their hiatus after the Astroworld tragedy, prompting speculation that they are building up to a big announcement. Kylie made her first post since the Nov. 5 tragedy on Christmas Eve, sharing a throwback photo of mom Kris Jenner. And for New Year's, she posted a black-and-white photo of herself showing off her bare bump and reflecting on the “blessings” and “heartache” 2021 brought her. Travis also posted for the first time since Astroworld on this date, sharing a black-and-white photo of himself looking at the ground. He simply wrote: “Always” alongside a brown heart emoji — something which appeared to be significant as Kylie shared two of them in the post’s comments, and Khloé four. Travis’s choice of caption also appears to be significant, with fans suggesting that “Always” or “Infinity” could be the new baby’s name after they noticed Kim Kardashian used the infinity emoji as a caption on a family photo on Jan. 4. These posts mark the first time the pair have posted on social media since 10 people died at the Astroworld tragedy seven weeks ago. Some fans have suggested that the couple are attempting to distance the news of their new arrival from the festival by sharing these interim posts. Just yesterday, Kylie took to Instagram again with more photos of her growing bump — which she captioned with the song lyrics “I am woman.” She also showed off her pregnancy body in videos posted over New Year. But despite using her Instagram comeback to try and dispel speculation that she’s already given birth, we know from her birthday posts that she’s no stranger to saving old videos and photos to share at a later date to throw fans off the scent. And, once again, her nails may have given the game away, with her choice of New Year’s manicure uncharacteristic to say the least. Celebrity nail technician Lisa Kon posted a close-up photo of Kylie’s fresh French manicure to her page last week (above), and fans quickly picked up on the fact that Kylie’s nails are much shorter than her usual style, which can be seen below. This suggests that the beauty guru has trimmed down her nails so as not to scratch her newborn when changing diapers and other day-to-day tasks that come with being a mom. Finally, claims that Kylie has secretly given birth reached fever pitch on Sunday, when she was suspiciously covered with blankets as she, Kris Jenner, and Corey Gamble were photographed departing a private jet. Of course the decision to cover up Kylie’s body raises questions, but her decision to fly at all while heavily pregnant is also highly suspicious. Pregnant women are advised against flying after 36 weeks, which Kylie would be well over if she became pregnant in April. And, finally, fans have also been quick to point out that this wouldn’t be the first time that Kylie has kept details of her pregnancy and delivery private. Back in 2017, she not only went into hiding and kept her first pregnancy a secret for the full nine months, but didn’t even announce the arrival of Stormi until Feb. 4, 2018 — three days after giving birth."

By the time the villagers knew Facebook was coming to town, it was already too late. Three weeks later their local councilors in the idyllic Dutch hamlet of Zeewolde voted 11–8 to rezone a swath of fertile farming land half the size of Central Park and hand it to Facebook to build its “hyperscale” data center — the largest in Holland.The local councilors, including those who voted in favor of the data center, engaged with the company for almost two years prior to the vote — but without knowing that “Tulip,” the mysterious entity they’d been negotiating with, was Facebook. In fact, the councilors were among the last to know, finding out only after Facebook issued a press release revealing Tulip’s true identity ahead of the vote. Advertisement  Facebook’s demand for secrecy around its data center in the Netherlands is the latest example of Big Tech’s aggressive but covert strategy to squeeze concessions from local governments. The veil of secrecy minimizes public scrutiny and backlash, often until it is too late.“It is very strange. Everything is normally very transparent — but with data centers, it is like a big black mystic box,” said Lars Ruiter, a former municipal councilor from Hollands Kroon, who told BuzzFeed News that his village found itself in a nearly identical situation in 2017 with a secret Microsoft data center project.
 


Since the Zeewolde vote, a firestorm of public criticism has compelled the Dutch national Senate to pass a parliamentary motion asking the government to halt the project pending a national policy on data centers. But such motions are usually not legally binding, and opponents of the data center are leaning on the commitment of the Netherlands’ newly formed government to present such a policy.Data centers are the cornerstone of cloud computing. They allow you to access your Google drive from any device anywhere in the world, upload photographs to your Instagram account, and stream Netflix. The business is extraordinarily profitable: Last year, Amazon’s cloud service, for example, had earned over $40 billion in revenue as of October. But data centers like the one Facebook proposed suck up enough energy to power a small town, use millions of gallons of water a day to cool their servers, and typically provide few jobs. This has raised questions about their sustainability, their impact on communities around them, and Big Tech’s insistence on building them in secret.In 2019, officials in Texas approved $10 million in tax breaks for a data center operated by a developer named Sharka LLC — later revealed to be Google. In Iowa, Microsoft has built at least three data centers while shielding its name from the public, according to the Des Moines Register. Facebook was believed to be using a shell company in Utah to push through bills favorable to data centers as far back as 2016.In the Netherlands, Facebook encountered a national and local bureaucracy eager to attract a major US tech giant but wary of the environmental costs and public resistance. So in late 2019, when Facebook first began exploring the possibility of building in Zeewolde, its identity was known only to a few senior officials in the national government. The mayor of Zeewolde found out a year into negotiations in early 2021, the King’s commissioner of the region a short time later. The people of Zeewolde were the last to know.Meanwhile, the company embarked on a bare-knuckle offensive to secure the land, despite Dutch bureaucrats noting that the project in Zeewolde violated the National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment and suggesting a different site.But Facebook was adamant about its chosen location. It even asked the government to designate its data center a project of “national importance,” a Dutch national policy normally intended to expedite land acquisition and project clearances for vital infrastructure like the national electricity grid.“The designation of a data center of national importance has never been done, so this would be difficult to explain and create a precedent for the establishment of (more) other data centers,” a Dutch bureaucrat tersely noted in an internal memo obtained by De Telegraaf. “It also seems undesirable to us to state that the location in Zeewolde is of national importance.”
 


Sandra Beckerman, a member of Dutch Parliament from the Socialist Party, said the laws around projects of national importance were drafted during the 2008 financial crisis and had been misused in the past. “The idea was to speed up projects in order to create jobs,” she said, which meant “far less democratic control by either local, regional governments or the public.” Large companies, she said, had “profited hugely from this law while local communities are deprived of rights they used to have.”Facebook also pushed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy to lean on the state-owned electricity utility to prioritize the company’s demands for its electricity substation, warning that it would consider establishing the data center in another country if its demands weren’t met. “Tulip offers us little or no time to continue working on this: they are already asking for a clear signal from EZK this or next week,” another memo said, noting that Facebook was actively lobbying the Dutch government to take urgent action. EZK is the Dutch acronym for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.The ministry’s bureaucrats worried that prioritizing Facebook’s demands would distort the expansion of the Dutch national grid. But they had little leverage to negotiate. “They have a preferred position because they have a lot of money and they can pay for that,” said Ben Sonneveld, a councilor who voted against the project. “They were treated differently than others who do not have the money and have to wait.”In the end, an accommodation for the substation was made, but demand to designate the project a data center of national importance was denied.
 


Rob Smeets, a former Zeewolde councilor who opposed the project, resigned from his post weeks before the crucial vote, telling the Dutch press he had done so under pressure from his own party after flagging unspecified conflicts of interest in the negotiations. He was replaced by Hank Parisius, a party colleague who voted in the favor of the project. Had Smeets stayed, Facebook’s margin of victory would have been a much narrower 10–9.Smeets told BuzzFeed News that he stood by his statement to the Dutch press but declined to elaborate on his allegations. Parisius did not respond to a request for comment.Beckerman, the MP, said years of budgetary cuts had disempowered local governments by making them far too reliant on property taxes. Facebook’s new data center could contribute up to 2 million euros a year in taxes to Zeewolde’s municipal budget, according to the mayor’s office. “Local and regional governments don't have the power to fight large companies,” she told BuzzFeed News. “They are willing to work with these tech companies because they are always in money troubles.”
 


Facebook’s data center project in Zeewolde and the company’s efforts to hide its involvement from the people who live there are particularly contentious because they touch on two emotive national issues: land and green energy, both of which are in short supply.The Netherlands is one of Europe’s more densely populated major nations, much of the acreage lies below sea level and is protected from flooding by oceanfront dykes, and also among the most reliant on fossil fuels. But the country is also the landing point for a bundle of transatlantic undersea telecommunication cables and home to one of Europe’s biggest internet exchanges, making it a compelling destination for data centers like Facebook’s.The Netherlands is also a tax haven. The Tax Justice Network ranks it fourth in the world behind the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda for “​​global tax abuse,” and eighth for “financial secrecy.” Which is worth noting, because when the first tranche of land for Facebook’s data center in Zeewolde was acquired, the sale was made to a shell company called Polder Networks. Company documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show Polder’s sole shareholder is a company called Liberation Management, which advertises itself as a discreet consultancy with offices in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Polder and Liberation did not respond to requests for comment, but Facebook spokesperson Kim van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News, “Polder Networks B.V. is the legal representative of Meta in the Netherlands that builds and manages the data center.”This combination of corporate secrecy, tax discretion, and telecom connectivity has meant Amsterdam is now home to one of Europe’s biggest concentrations of data centers — but much of the data in the Netherlands serves users around the world. Advertisement  “Two-thirds of the data center capacity in the Netherlands is used for companies and residents not in the Netherlands,” said René Buck, founder of Buck Consultants International. Last year, a Buck Consultants International study commissioned by the Dutch government suggested that large-scale data centers offer little direct economic benefit to the communities that live around them.
 


“We often spread data needs throughout our data center infrastructure — in fact, we currently serve traffic quickly and reliably around the world,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News. “So there is no guarantee that user traffic in the region will be served exclusively by this facility.Data centers consume large amounts of energy, but with many big tech companies eager to burnish their green credentials, they are increasingly located near sources of renewable energy. Many data centers in the Netherlands are monopolizing scarce green energy supplies for their own use to the chagrin of local communities.In 2017, for instance, Microsoft announced its massive data center in the Netherlands was buying up 100% of the electricity produced by a giant wind farm not far from Amsterdam. Microsoft touted this as an example of its commitment to sustainability, a perspective faithfully reproduced in sections of the press. Back in the Netherlands, commentators noted that the wind farm produced enough energy to power 370,000 homes — but all the energy was being sucked up by a single American company.Beckerman told BuzzFeed News outrage was building among citizens irked to see their tax dollars funneled into renewable energy investments that largely benefited foreign companies. “People can’t pay their energy bill, and 50% of the energy bill is made up of taxes,” she said.The municipality of Zeewolde estimates Facebook’s data center would use twice the energy used by the whole town. Ben Sonneveld, a Zeewolde councilor who voted against the project, said the company had not been upfront about how this green energy would be sourced.
 


Most of Zeewolde’s energy comes from about 400 windmills on the outskirts of the town. Project opponents like Sonneveld fear that, much like Microsoft’s data center in neighboring Holland Kroons, Facebook's arrival in Zeewolde would mean more common lands lost to windmills. While the company has made no specific references to investing in wind farms in Zeewolde, the secrecy around the project thus far has meant residents fear they will only find out about any potential wind farms when it is too late.“I calculate that we need another 140 windmills,” Sonneveld said. “So where do we put them? Nobody knows.”Zeewolde Mayor Gerrit Jan Gorter, a strong proponent of the project, told BuzzFeed News that Facebook had not received any financial incentives or tax breaks to invest in Zeewolde and that a data center in the town did not violate planning guidelines. He argued that the data center will bring jobs and investment to the region. The town council is looking to build more windmills in Zeewolde, he said, but the windmill project predates and would not be directly connected to the data center project. Gorter said Facebook’s data center intends to use “100% green power” by purchasing green certificates (known as ""guarantees of origin,"" or GVO) across the European electricity network. A GVO is essentially like a carbon credit, but for renewable energy.Gorter said the secrecy around Facebook’s data center was standard operating procedure when attracting new investment to the region to ensure that the local government did not discriminate between companies.“The actual name of the company should not make a difference as they only have to decide whether a company meets the requirements for establishment in Zeewolde,” said Gorter, referring to the recently concluded council vote on the project, “and that does not depend on the name of the company.”And Facebook argued that despite the secrecy around the project, it only has the best of intentions. ""We understand and respect that any major project and change can lead to questions and concerns. It is therefore good to emphasize that we do everything we can to be a good neighbor for everyone in the area, such as the farmers and residents of the municipality of Zeewolde,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News.
 


As late as 1972, the entire province of Flevoland, where Zeewolde is situated, was a shallow brackish marsh. Every acre in Zeewolde, residents said, was painstakingly claimed by damming an inlet of the North Sea — the culmination of a decadeslong process that began in 1924 and ended sometime in 1984.“It’s a very young village, it’s the youngest village in our country. The land is very fertile. So to give 166 hectares of fertile land to metal boxes is beyond our imagination,” said Susan Schaap, who said she moved here 23 years ago. “Zeewolde is a beautiful village. There’s a lot of woods, there’s a beach, there’s sun, there’s a lot of sand, there’s a lot to do for children.”Schaap is the administrator of Stichting DataTruc Zeewolde, a Facebook group of residents opposed to the data center in their village.
 


“It’s not like it’s a data center where they store all this data for maybe payments, hospital applications, or, you know, medical things,” Schaap said. “They have all this information stored from people, which they sell to advertisers.”For now, the public backlash against the deal has slowed the sale of the land. A spokesperson for the Netherlands’ Central Government Real Estate Agency said the land would be transferred to Facebook only if a set of mandatory sustainability requirements were met.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is slowly walking back its public support for the data center despite doing everything in its power to help Facebook. When BuzzFeed News asked the ministry for its formal position on Facebook’s data center, its spokesperson deferred to Zeewolde’s municipality.Beckerman, the opposition MP, said the various accommodations offered to Facebook stood in stark contrast to the experiences of the ordinary Dutch citizen when interacting with their local government.“I guess people are really fed up with the government always acting in the best interest of these large companies,” Beckerman said, adding this was “another example of a government putting too much energy and time and money in these kinds of companies.” ●

In the beginning, it was scary, but it was also relatively simple: Stay home. Shut down. Wear a mask. Stay 6 feet apart. Get your shot.Now, though, things feel a lot more complicated.You can get together safely with vaccinated loved ones over the holidays, but maybe you should reconsider. Omicron appears to be more infectious, but less deadly; though you should still worry about Delta, which is less infectious, but more deadly. Schools are still open — until they’re not, sometimes not even virtually. Social media is full of posts from friends either out partying or at home quarantining. Please still wear a mask in public, but not a cloth one, even though it’s still common to exercise in most gyms without one altogether. Rapid tests are useful but hard to find and maybe not so useful after all. Fully vaccinated means two shots, but also get your booster. If you have COVID but don’t have symptoms you should isolate for 10 days — no, wait, it’s five now — but then only reenter public in a mask if you can test negative, but also if you can’t find a test, that’s OK too. Advertisement  As Americans prepare to enter their third straight year of the coronavirus pandemic, clarity feels hard to come by for many.“Honestly I’m more confused now than I was all of 2020,” said Luis Luna, a 28-year-old advertising accounts manager in Austin. “So many friends and family got infected in December, and everyone had different symptoms. It’s just hard to keep up with instructions from the CDC and most government agencies.”
 


Ileana Schinder, an architect in Washington, DC, was in tears as she described the stress and concern she has for her two young children who are lurching back and forth between classroom instruction and remote learning with each new outbreak in their class. Schinder, 45, said she feels hollow and exhausted, as if she’s run a marathon in pursuit of a bus that keeps driving forward one block at a time, over and over. “I’m an architect. I should be able to design my way out of this mental labyrinth, but I can’t,” she said. “Can you?”The world looks markedly different than it did when COVID first swept and shuttered the globe. There are now multiple vaccines that are safe and effective at preventing serious illness. More than 4.6 billion people around the world have had at least one shot. We know infinitely more about the virus, including how to test for it relatively cheaply and easily. We have new lifesaving treatments. “This is not March of 2020,” President Joe Biden assured a weary public just before Christmas. “Two hundred million [Americans] are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.”And yet as Omicron now infects record numbers of people globally, filling up hospitals and closing businesses and classrooms, there is a lingering and strange sense of déjà vu, even if it also feels different this time.
 


“Earlier in the pandemic, I was actually really scared I could end up killing my mother. That was a very real fear,” said Allison Clough, a 50-year-old mother of two teens in the Bay Area who asked to be identified by her middle name so as not to embarrass her kids. “I don’t think that’s very likely anymore. I don’t feel scared in that way, but it’s ruining our lives again. I guess it’s kind of confusing.”As regular people struggle to make sense of this point in the pandemic, experts are also wondering how we got here — and how we haven’t done a better job of preparing for it. “We’re in a difficult time. We’re in a strange time,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “We’re in a time where we’ve had two years of experience with this disease, with this virus, and it continues to evolve … But as it evolves, we’re still in many ways kind of chasing it.”
 


Arthur Caplan, medical ethics director at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, was far more blunt and sweeping in his assessment of the current state of confusion. “I would say we’re in a cacophonous, disorienting, deteriorating mess,” he said.“Many people have no idea what to do about something simple like masking,” he continued. “Huge numbers of people are frustrated by the complete failure to provide adequate amounts of test kits. Parents are furious they’re not getting consistent policies that should have been planned weeks ago about what happens to their kids. Messaging from the CDC and other government authorities has become a mishmash of confusion for many people. Most people I talk to don’t know what fully vaccinated means and no one seems to be helping them understand it. And the internet is awash with escalating misinformation and conspiracy content.“Otherwise,” Caplan joked, “things are good.”
 


It is somewhat inevitable that the pandemic and people’s decision matrix have become more complex, given both the evolving nature of affairs and the virus itself. Even before the Omicron variant emerged, requiring yet more study and analysis, people around the world were already trying to adapt their lives around COVID. Workers were returning to offices. International borders had reopened. People were dancing in nightclubs again, albeit in many places that check vaccine cards at the door. We got to celebrate Thanksgiving.Omicron then arrived at a time when each person’s perception of risk was already changing, at an inflection point in public thinking. After a summer dashed by Delta, many had already begun to imagine a world where COVID would be with us for quite some time. The new variant’s incredible infectiousness, and apparent relative mildness for vaccinated individuals, has only seemed to deepen a sense of inevitability for many people. As comic Isabel Hagen joked, “Making plans in 2022: I can’t get covid this week, but I could next week?”“It’s with us. It’s omnipresent,” said American Medical Association President Gerald Harmon. “We’re trying to adapt to that and we’re trying to avoid being overrun, not only in our day-to-day lives but in our healthcare systems.”“We want to have this in the rearview mirror and we can’t quite get there,” Harmon said. “It always seems to be alongside us in the passing lane, and every now and then it gets ahead of us.” Advertisement  The AMA was especially critical this week of the CDC’s evolving guidance on quarantine and isolation, which has seesawed on whether a negative test was necessary for asymptomatic people to reenter public life after five days. The guidance has even confused US senators. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, whose communication skills have come under intense scrutiny, had defended the decision by arguing the tests don’t definitively show whether someone is still infectious, but large sectors of the public have not been able to keep up with this nuance.With an unmistakable sense of incredulity, Harmon released a statement on Wednesday in which the AMA president appeared aghast at the CDC. “Nearly two years into this pandemic, with Omicron cases surging across the country, the American people should be able to count on [the CDC] for timely, accurate, clear guidance to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities,” he said. “Instead, the new recommendations on quarantine and isolation are not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus.”Harmon told BuzzFeed News his intention was not to assign blame and that he still has trust and confidence in the CDC, but that he felt a duty to speak out at what he saw as mixed messaging. “When I see something that’s a little bit incongruent, it makes me a little bit uncertain,” he said.In defending the CDC, one prominent scientist who spoke with BuzzFeed News — but asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the questions — said they believed there is a “false assumption” that experts are all-knowing all the time. “There’s this idea in the public that the knowledge is kind of static: ‘Just tell us what it is! Why are you waffling around?’” this scientist said. Advertisement  “But the knowledge is accruing day by day and it’s going to change day by day as the data changes. It’s not something that can be reduced to one simple sentence because there’s all these ‘if not this, then that, and if not that, then this.’ It gets very geeky.”“I don’t think the scientists and the public health experts are confused. But there is uncertainty,” they said, citing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. “It’s a different thing, though, to not be confused and to know what’s going to happen. The scientists don’t know what’s going to happen, but they’re not confused about what does happen.”For regular Americans, though, it has been somewhat hard to keep up. “In my opinion, the CDC has been frustratingly unclear on defining a mask’s effect on determining close contacts,” said Roger Yamada, a 38-year-old attorney in New York City. “How do we assess cloth masks vs. surgical masks vs. KN95/KF94/N95 masks? Or does it not matter at all?”“More than anything it’s just annoying,” said Daniel Golson, a 28-year-old social media editor in Los Angeles, who with his friends is navigating the maze of testing and isolation guidelines after an outbreak among some of them on a New Year’s trip to Montana. “I want to do the right thing to prevent me from potentially infecting others, but I also don't want to unnecessarily spend money to have to stay in a place and not go home if I don't need to.”
 


Public health officials have been clear that this Omicron wave is not like previous surges. Top White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci has said it was “very prudent” for the CDC to try to change its guidance based on the emerging data on the variant’s transmissibility and period of infectiousness, in order to try to avoid massive staff shortages across every industry and effectively keep society running. Fauci also said this past weekend that the US was entering a new stage of the pandemic where hospitalizations, not total caseloads, should be the focus of public attention.But the prominent scientist said it was evident there was something of a fissure between experts and the public. “The American public has become over decades science illiterate,” they said. “Scientists tend to talk in a different language than regular people can understand. It’s kind of a mismatch between those who communicate and those who want to be communicated with not talking the same language.”
 


Caplan, the NYU medical ethicist, said he believed that due to this scientific illiteracy, it was natural that people have become confused, even angry, by the shifting messages. “If you have lousy training on critical thinking and scientific methods in your high schools and junior high schools then it’s no accident that citizens don’t know how to interpret what’s going on in a plague,” he said.Clough, the Bay Area mother, said her friendship circles seem torn in two by those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to trying to live in what they feel is their new reality. “Some of my friends are worried school closures are going to be a drag and others are still afraid they’re gonna die,” she said. “It’s a little hard to navigate between all that.”Tensions are also high in her community, where whether or not your children will be in class can depend on a county line. Everyone she knows is vaccinated, including her kids and their friends, but there seems to be politics everywhere. She’s noticed people again walking solo on the beach but still wearing a mask, which she thinks they’re doing as some sort of statement. She said she was accused of wanting to murder teachers when she raised a statistic about the extremely low risk of children becoming extremely ill or dying from COVID. “Just looking at the numbers, the chance that even without the booster shot my 13-year-old is going to end up seriously ill is vanishingly small,” she said, “but it’s become so politicized in my extremely liberal community that it’s almost like some people want to hold on to the possibility of that against all this data.”In DC, Schinder, the architect and mother, begrudgingly admitted she’s even begun to question her own Democratic politics when she looks with jealousy at photos of friends’ children in Republican-led states where schools have stubbornly stayed open through most of the pandemic. How is it fair, she wonders, that her city’s leaders seem to be prioritizing people’s right to go to bars over her kids being in a classroom?
 


“If you’d have told me that two years down the road my kids wouldn’t be in school, I’d have thought that we didn’t yet have a vaccine, a health solution. But we’ve moved on from that. We have a health solution,” Schinder said. “What pains me is we’re still adapting every decision to those that effectively decide to ride bicycles without a helmet, to those that ride in cars without seatbelts. I think it’s time to move on.”A group of former Biden expert advisers might agree with her. Six scientists who served on the president’s transition health advisory board on Thursday published a series of opinion pieces in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for the administration to now focus on what they called “the new normal of life with COVID.” Omicron, they said, had “created concern about a perpetual state of emergency.”They advocated, among other things, for changes and improvements to testing, vaccine mandates and technology, and data collection. But more than anything, they said the focus needed to be on the future, not the cloud of the current crisis. “We think a lot of work still needs to be done to see through that smoke to see how this is going to end, and start laying down steps for how we will be able to live a normal life,” one of the scientists, Rick Bright, told the New York Times.Both the APHA’s Benjamin and the AMA’s Harmon said they also felt more of a focus on modeling was needed to better predict and respond to future iterations of this virus and others so as to avoid more chaos. That could include extensive new investment in public health infrastructure and preventative medicine, such as vaccines.“The nature of the virus is unpredictable, but that’s the nature of any enemy,” said Harmon, a retired Air Force major general. “Using a military analogy, we need to not fight the current war or previous wars, we need to plan for future engagements. We need to think of asymmetric warfare with this virus.”Still, Harmon said, right now an urgent challenge is to try to reach those weary soldiers on the homefront who are finding themselves, like Clough in the Bay Area, struggling to see the way forward.“Even when things seem nutty, I don’t have the energy to develop strong opinions and advocate for them like I did in the first shutdown,” Clough said. “I can’t muster the same passion for it that I had earlier. I feel tired. I feel a little bit resigned to whatever is going to happen.” ●

95,It’s almost like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous.,"


Sidney Poitier, the trailblazing Bahamian American actor whose commanding talent and immense charm helped him shatter racial barriers in Hollywood and pave the way for generations of Black talent, died Thursday. He was 94.His death was announced by Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis, who said in an address that his country was mourning the cultural icon.“We admire the man, not just because of his colossal achievements,” Davis said, “but also because of who he was, his strength of character, his willingness to stand up and be counted, and the way he plotted and navigated his life’s journey.” Advertisement  The first Black man to win an Oscar, Poitier was revered around the world for helping to advance US racial dialogue in the turbulent 1960s through his art and celebrity.At their core, his most celebrated performances — a wandering and wry ex-soldier helping a group of nuns build a chapel in Lilies of the Field; the patient yet stern teacher to an unruly London high school class in To Sir, With Love; a cerebral detective battling racism and crime in the Deep South in In the Heat of the Night — were each built off a quiet elegance and beguiling grace that were unmistakably Poitier’s own.A lion of American cinema, Poitier has been championed as a pioneer and personal role model by some of the country’s most celebrated Black entertainers, including Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, and Oprah Winfrey. At a 1992 event honoring Poitier, the actor was stunned to discover civil rights icon Rosa Parks was in the audience. She, too, admitted to being a Poitier fan.“It’s been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones —milestones of artistic excellence, milestones of America’s progress,” said former president Barack Obama in honoring the actor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 — some 42 years after Poitier’s character in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner dreamed of his biracial children one day growing up to be president.
 


Poitier was born two months prematurely in Miami in 1927, and his parents were impoverished tomato farmers visiting from the Bahamas. At a loss, his mother took her weak baby to a fortune-teller who assured her: “Don’t worry about your son. He will not be a sickly child. He will walk with kings. He will step on pillars of gold. And he will carry your name to many places.” (Evelyn Poitier lived long enough to see her son become the first Black Best Actor winner.)Raised in the Caribbean nation until he was a teenager, on an island he once said had just two white people on it, Poitier grew up unaware of the racial politics simmering just across the sea in the US. “No one ever told me, ‘You must be careful because there are things out there that are not friendly [for Black people],’” he later said.After arriving in the US, and a brief service in the medical corps during World War II, he was rejected from New York City’s American Negro Theater because of his accent. Fueled by the sting of rejection, he fastidiously listened to radio announcers, mimicking their enunciation to shed his own until he was accepted into the same theater group just six months later.A career on Broadway followed, but cinema proved more difficult due to the scarcity of roles for Black actors that weren’t steeped in racial stereotypes. “It was difficult. [Black actors] were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,” he told Winfrey in 2000. “Not only was I not going to do that, but I had in mind what was expected of me — not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.” Advertisement  His early screen roles reflected his unwillingness to cater to Hollywood’s restrictive demands in favor of more challenging fare: a Black doctor caring for a bigoted white criminal in 1950’s No Way Out (so controversial it was banned in the British-ruled Bahamas and parts of the US); a clergyperson in apartheid South Africa in Cry, the Beloved Country (1951); and an inner-city high school tough brimming with untapped potential in Blackboard Jungle (1955).In 1959, he became the first Black man to be nominated for a competitive Academy Award for his role as a prison escapee in The Defiant Ones — a film he later said he was only able to do because he agreed to act in another film he found more problematic, 1960’s Porgy and Bess.He also starred in the 1959 milestone premiere of Lorraine Hansberry’s now-classic play A Raisin in the Sun, the first play ever written by a Black woman to show on Broadway. “Never before,” declared the writer James Baldwin, “had so much of the truth of Black people’s lives been seen onstage.”
 


But it was during the 1960s that Poitier truly came into his own, delivering a series of performances that would leave indelible marks on American cinema.He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1963’s Lilies of the Field, cementing his place in movie history as the first Black man to take home an Oscar. (Hattie McDaniel had won the Best Supporting Actress prize in 1940 for her role in Gone With the Wind.)Not expecting to prevail in a category that included Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Rex Harrison, and Paul Newman, Poitier had prepared no acceptance speech but took the stage to thunderous applause.“Because it is a long journey to this moment, I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people,” a visibly emotional Poitier told the Oscars crowd in his acceptance speech.
 


His most prolific year came in 1967 with the release of To Sir, With Love; In the Heat of the Night; and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, one of the most notable films to so directly address and debate the racial politics that America was grappling with during the decade. As Poitier’s character meets the supposedly enlightened parents (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, in his final role) of his white fiancé (Katharine Houghton), the four must confront the prejudices and fears of the era in 100 minutes of domestic discussion.“You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it’s got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight of you be off our backs!” Poitier’s character tells his father (Roy E. Glenn) in one of the film’s most memorable speeches. “You think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man.”By 1967’s end, the most famous Black man in cinema was also the industry’s top-grossing box office star of the year.
 


Poitier’s most iconic characters were, by and large, honorable men — endlessly patient, reliably affable, and wholly stripped of any semblance of sexuality — a conscious choice, he said, because of the pressures of history weighing upon him.Citing Quincy Jones, Winfrey later told Poitier he had “created and defined the African American in film.”“It’s been an enormous responsibility,” he acknowledged. “And I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.”
 


His character choices also earned him his detractors, though, with some turning on him for supposedly playing exclusively to white America. “He thinks these films have really been helping to change the stereotypes that Black actors are subjected to,” African American playwright Clifford Mason wrote in a famous 1967 New York Times piece titled “Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?” “In essence, they are merely contrivances, completely lacking in any real artistic merit. In all of these films he has been a showcase nigger, who is given a clean suit and a complete purity of motivation so that, like a mistreated puppy, he has all the sympathy on his side.”Poitier told Winfrey the “Uncle Tom” backlash was hurtful but not totally unexpected in the turbulence of the civil rights era: “It was far from the truth, but I understood the times. There was a public display of all the rage that [Black people] had built up over centuries.”“What the name-callers missed was that the films I did were designed not just for Blacks but for the mainstream,” he said. “I was in concert with maybe a half dozen filmmakers, and they were all white. And they chose to make films that would make a statement to a mainstream audience about the awful nature of racism.”The criticism led Poitier to a “crossroads” in his career, as he termed it, moving him behind the camera to the director’s chair.Apart from reprising his In the Heat of the Night role in two sequels, his career in the 1970s was most notable for the many films he directed (and in which he also occasionally starred): the 1974 comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Billy Cosby and Harry Belafonte; two more Cosby films, Let’s Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977); and 1980’s Stir Crazy, featuring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. (He also helmed the 1990 vehicle Ghost Dad, one of the most terrific flops in movie history.)
 


As the decades continued, Poitier delivered largely forgettable roles on television and in cinema, but his iconic status had already been cemented in the American cultural canon.It took almost 40 years for a second Black actor to win the Best Actor prize, with Denzel Washington claiming the statue in 2002 for Training Day.Poitier was in the audience that night, too, having been bestowed an Honorary Oscar for his work in the industry inscribed with the words, “To Sidney Poitier, in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.”As Washington took the stage, Poitier looked on, beaming.“Forty years I’ve been chasing Sidney, they finally give it to me. What do they do? They give it to him the same night,” Washington joked. “I’ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I’ll always be following in your footsteps.”

96,This woman lives in a house truck — but she doesn’t want you to think it’s always as glamorous as the internet portrays it to be.,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019. Advertisement     I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends.“That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing. Advertisement     Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake. Advertisement     “It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

WASHINGTON — Prosecutors say Anthony Williams of Michigan joined the mob that stormed the US Capitol. With federal charges pending a year later, Williams filed a request in court shortly after 2 p.m. on Thursday asking for permission to leave the country for a 10-day trip to Jamaica.Two hours later, the judge delivered her ruling: Absolutely not.In a one-paragraph order laced with disbelief that Williams would make such a request at all under the circumstances, US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell explained that Williams’ request not only was inappropriate given the status of his case but also that his timing was terrible. Advertisement     “This Court will not commemorate the one-year anniversary of this attack on the Capitol by granting defendant's request for non-essential foreign travel when he is awaiting judgment for his actions on that day,” Howell wrote.When and how people charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection can travel has been a fraught issue in these cases before. In February, Jenny Cudd of Texas asked for permission to go on a work-related bonding retreat to Mexico. The ask was not unheard of; it’s common for judges to allow defendants facing nonviolent offenses to travel if they’re complying with their pretrial release conditions. But Cudd’s request, the fact that the prosecutor didn’t oppose it, and the judge’s approval made her a lightning rod for criticism that the Justice Department and judges were treating alleged Capitol rioters with kid gloves.When Florida couple Dana Winn and Rachael Pert asked to appear by video for their December sentencing instead of traveling from their home state to Washington, DC, US District Judge Trevor McFadden rejected the request.“Defendants found the means to travel to Washington, D.C. to commit the crime to which they have pled guilty,” McFadden wrote at the time. “Defendants can therefore find the means to return to Washington, D.C. to be held accountable for this crime.”
 


Williams is facing a five-count indictment, including one felony charge for obstructing an official proceeding. According to his charging papers, the FBI received a tip that he had posted on Facebook about being at the Capitol on Jan. 6. After getting access to the account through a search warrant, the government alleged that it found videos and photos that showed him inside. In one video, the person identified as Williams talks about storming the building and pushing back against police officers. “We took this fucking building,” he says in the video. The FBI also pulled messages that he had allegedly posted, including, “Was proudest day of my life lol felt like the founding fathers were smiling down on us in that room.”Those words partly doomed Williams’ effort to get to Jamaica. He had been allowed to go home after he was charged and arrested in March. In his travel request, his lawyer wrote that he had been in a romantic relationship for “more than a year” and was hoping to meet his girlfriend’s family, who live in Negril, located in the western part of the country. He would leave in late January, stay for 10 days, and work at a local nonprofit during the visit.The pretrial services officer, who supervises Williams’ compliance with his pretrial release conditions, didn’t oppose the trip, but the prosecutor did.Howell began her order by recapping the request: “Defendant, while on pretrial release and facing charges including a serious felony offense, stemming from his alleged actions on January 6, 2021, wishes to leave the Michigan winter to spend ten days in the warmer climes of Jamaica to meet the family of a woman with whom defendant has been in a committed relationship for ‘more than a year.’”She continued: “Although such a meeting may be an important step in defendant's personal relationship, defendant surrendered his entitlement to unfettered international travel when, also ‘more than a year’ ago, on December 30, 2020, he allegedly announced his intent to ‘Storm the Swamp,’ and one week later, on January 6, 2021, followed through by joining a mob at the Capitol that, in his words, ‘took [that] fucking building,’ an event he allegedly viewed as the ‘proudest day of [his] life.’”The judge concluded with the denial, invoking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack.Williams is due to appear before Howell again on Jan. 21 for a hearing on the status of his case. His lawyer declined to comment.

A stockpile of as many as 1 million COVID-19 tests sat in a Florida warehouse and expired, Gov. Ron DeSantis admitted on Jan. 6 as the state and the rest of the country are facing a steep demand for tests and a surge of new infections.But rather than let the tests go unused, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed the state to extend the expiration date of the tests, allowing them to be used until March as the state, and the rest of the country, faces a surge of new COVID cases due to the Omicron variant. Advertisement     The governor's office had previously brushed off questions about the stockpile's expiration, but when asked during a press conference, the state's Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie admitted that somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million tests had expired at the end of the year.""We tried to get them out,"" Guthrie told reporters. ""But there was not a demand for it.""Yet last week, Floridians reportedly waited up to three hours to get a COVID-19 test as cases and potential exposures spiked due to the more infectious Omicron variant. And on Dec. 21, officials in the state's most populous county, Miami-Dade, reportedly asked state officials to send any available tests to meet the spiking demand.""We are asking that all possible tests that come through the state for distribution be allocated to Miami-Dade given the surge in demand in our community for testing options,"" a spokesperson for the county mayor's office told Local 10. Advertisement     In a letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, the FDA extended the expiration of the tests to 15 months due to Florida's ""ongoing stability studies."" The extension marks the second time Florida has requested an expiration date extension for that particular batch of tests.The tests, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said, were not at-home tests and must be administered by professionals.
 


DeSantis on Jan. 6 said tests were being sent out to local jurisdictions as requested. Demand for COVID tests had slowed down in September, when the tests in the stockpile were first set to expire, he added.""There was no withholding of anything,"" the governor told reporters.State officials at that time requested permission from federal health officials to extend the use of the tests for three more months, Guthrie said. That request was granted, but still the tests sat unused and expired between Dec. 26 and Dec. 30.Florida officials then requested another three-month extension to use the tests.""The thing is, if they're not authorized, if they're not accurate, we don't want to send inaccurate tests,"" DeSantis said.The existence of the unused tests became public when Florida agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried put out a statement about them, pointing out they were about to expire. Advertisement     ""Given the Governor's lack of transparency throughout this pandemic, there's no known public information about these tests or how soon they expire,"" she said on Dec. 30 in a statement. ""With omicron infections exploding throughout Florida, I beg of him to release these tests immediately to local counties and cities, and to stand up state-sponsored testing sites. To let these tests expire while Floridians anxiously wait for hours in testing lines is negligent at best, and heartless at worst.""Fried, a Democrat, is currently running for governor.DeSantis's office at first brushed off questions about the tests, with his spokesperson Christina Pushaw telling a local NBC 2 reporter that Fried's allegation was ""bizarre.""After DeSantis admitted the tests had expired, Pushaw then inaccurately tweeted that the tests had expired before the Omicron surge, leaving out that an extension of their use had been authorized.Fried, in turn, accused DeSantis and his office of lying and now attempting a cover-up.""The governor of the third largest state lied to you about COVID tests,"" she tweeted. ""When we caught him, he used your tax dollars to come after me for telling you the truth.""

Federal prosecutors say a key FBI informant in the alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan was a “double agent” who was “working against the interests of the government” by trying to destroy evidence and prevent arrests.The confidential informant, Stephen Robeson, played a central role in the investigation that led to the arrest of 14 men for allegedly participating in a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October 2020. At the direction of his FBI handlers, Robeson reached out to potential targets, organized meetings, and paid travel expenses for people to attend such events. Advertisement     Now the government appears to be disowning its own operative, saying he deceived the FBI and at times actively aided targets of the investigation.Defendants have claimed that it was overzealous government informants, including Robeson, who hatched the alleged plot to kidnap a sitting governor. The defendants have denounced the case as entrapment and an example of “egregious overreaching,” claiming they never would have contemplated the purported crimes without the informants’ involvement.In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors said that Robeson violated the terms of his agreement with the FBI, including by possessing firearms despite having felony convictions, offering the use of “charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks,” and offering a drone to “aid in acts of domestic terrorism.”In addition, the filing said that Robeson failed to record “pertinent conversations and events,” didn’t tell his government handlers about other recordings he’d made, tried to delete recordings, and attempted to warn “at least one of the defendants shortly before their arrest” in October 2020. Advertisement     Last month, Robeson was charged with fraud in state court in Wisconsin. He was also charged last March with a gun crime in federal court to which he ultimately pleaded guilty, under a highly favorable plea deal that involves no jail time despite his multiple prior convictions. Despite that, the Justice Department has remained largely silent on his activities in the Michigan investigation, not even confirming his role as an informant — until now.The prosecutors’ statements may have significant implications. Defense attorneys have been trying to get Robeson’s communications admitted as evidence, because they want to show that instead of just observing and informing on the accused, he pushed them into a plot they would never otherwise have come up with or agreed to. To that end, the lawyers last month identified dozens of statements by Robeson they hope to bring up during the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 8 in Grand Rapids federal court.The government’s response, laid out in the new filing, has been to disavow Robeson entirely. In the filing, they call him “an unreliable declarant” — legal speak for a liar — and say that his statements cannot be used as evidence.Robeson’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Attorneys for several of the defendants also declined to comment.Defendants have also sought to introduce communications between FBI agents and their informants, saying they help prove that the government planted specific ideas about violence in their heads. Advertisement     For example, in August 2020, agent Jayson Chambers wrote to an informant known as Dan: “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”But in Thursday’s filing, prosecutors said that any statements made by the agents that the government has not specifically cited in search warrants, charging documents, or other formal court filings should not be admitted in court. Although they were working for the FBI on an active investigation at the time they uttered those words, prosecutors say they were “the agents’ own statements and not the statements of the United States government.”The Justice Department has previously stated its intentions to keep those agents off the stand.Chambers was removed from the witness list five days after BuzzFeed News reported that he had incorporated a security business and that an online troll linked to the business had been tweeting about the case before it became public. Another agent has been accused of perjury in a separate case.Defense attorneys, however, are expected to try to call both of them, as well as Robeson, and to question them before the jury about their actions in the investigation.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

As millions of COVID cases spread across the US, teachers and parents have been thrown into chaos as some school districts revert to remote learning, leading to rising tensions as families try to limit exposing loved ones to the virus.Without universal childcare in the US, many parents rely on schools and are exhausted by the prospect of balancing at-home learning responsibilities on top of careers or other caregiving. Teachers, meanwhile, fear they can’t provide effective instruction with so many students either at home with illness or kept from schools by their parents. Advertisement     And then there’s the disarray for teachers who are also parents, a group that is struggling to protect the health of their students and that of their own children. BuzzFeed News spoke to multiple teachers who are parents, many of whom have made the difficult choice to keep children home given how much the coronavirus is spreading in schools — a frustrating move for educators who believe that in-person learning is always better.Some are taking lessons home for their kids or making them up independently while also leading their classes and volunteering free time to support unions. They’re more burned out than ever and afraid they’ll be the ones to bring home the virus.“It feels unfair,” said Andrea Keller, a teacher at PS 96 in the Bronx and a parent of 4-year-old twins. “We, as teachers, have to sacrifice the health of our own children to accommodate other people’s children.”Keller used one of her sick days Wednesday to stay home with one of her children who has croup, a side effect of COVID that’s essentially an infection of the upper airway, but she said her classroom was practically empty that day anyway. In addition to her own family, Keller said nearly half her students tested positive for COVID over the holiday break. Advertisement     Her school’s attendance has been lagging since classes resumed Jan. 3, Keller said, and for people like her who are teachers and parents, they face additional complexity as the new year begins — teachers don’t want to go to work at the expense of their family’s safety.“I’m just biding time until I can get a good lesson or a good amount of kids,” Keller said. “The school has to open so other people can have free childcare, but now my kid is sick because I went to school and I brought home the virus. And now I have to stay home and lose a sick day so that you can send your kid to school for babysitting because they’re not getting an education right now.”For teachers who are parents like Keller, she said it feels like the decision is made without any concern for what teaching in person would risk for her own children, who are too young to be vaccinated against COVID.“It starts the domino effect of now, you insist that your kids have in-person schooling, so now I have to show up to teach your kids, but that doesn't address my own children and their needs,” Keller said.School districts in cities including Pittsburgh, Detroit, St. Louis, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have opted for temporary virtual learning, citing health and safety concerns.Parents across the country responded with outrage and a sense of hopelessness at the prospect of once again balancing full-time work or childcare with homeschooling — and their reactions reflect a situation in which there are few good options. But the worst option, experts say, is to further hollow the divide between parents and teachers. Advertisement     “I don’t think we want to set up or exacerbate potential conflict between parents and teachers, when so many parents are teachers as well,” said Dan Ehlke, associate professor of health policy at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health.The pandemic has stressed the issue of inaccessible childcare in the US, Ehlke added. A side effect of this is tension between teachers unions and parents. In Chicago, students missed a second day of school Thursday after the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and school administrators failed to reach an agreement. Some Chicago Public School parents responded to the union’s vote to switch to remote with frustration, saying they were not prepared and couldn’t afford to miss work.“I don’t think it’s easy for anyone involved in this,” said Lori Koziana, a teacher at Mather High School in Chicago who told BuzzFeed News she was home sick with COVID. “I just want us to find a middle.”
 


Koziana said she isolated for a week and tested negative before returning to classes on Monday, when 32 of her students were absent (CPS ceased testing students before they came into buildings).“I go to great lengths to make sure I’m healthy,” Koziana said, adding that she distances from her own students and only walks in the school’s hallways during specific low-traffic periods of the day.But by Wednesday she had the virus.“It’s very difficult at the high school level to social distance in any meaningful way when you have thousands of kids in hallways moving from one class to the next,” she said, adding that she supports the union’s vote for a temporary switch to remote learning to allow local healthcare systems to catch up with demand.Her sons, one a high school sophomore, the other a senior, are isolating at their father’s house, she said, but one of them is developmentally delayed and the other is severely immunocompromised. Remote learning isn’t an option for CPS students, so she has to send them back to school as soon as their isolation ends or they won’t keep up.“A lot of these considerations are getting intertwined with labor relations,” Ehlke told BuzzFeed News, adding that it's “atrocious” some districts justify labor-related decisions like salary cuts or benefits changes for teachers who opt to work from home for reasons involving the pandemic.Ehlke and his wife are teachers and parents of three children, and he said it's easy to have conflict within families like his when educators must prioritize other kids’ health over that of their own. Not to mention the distraction and burnout caused by exhausting disagreement over COVID responses, he said, which has set up districts for major teacher shortages across the country, even before Omicron hit.Because the American school system is so localized, the experience for parents who are teachers varies from place to place, he said. With each town making its own COVID protocol, it's difficult for teachers who are parents to find a situation that works for their careers and families. For example, a teacher may work in one district and send their child to school in another — but what happens when their own child goes remote and they have to go to work in person? Or when they bring COVID home to their unvaccinated children?
 


“That’s where you see particular conflict,” Ehlke said.One solution, Keller said, would be to implement more restrictive in-person measures. For example, her classroom roster has nearly doubled compared to last year, the school has stopped staggering when kids eat, and students aren’t tested as they enter the building.“It would be helpful if we could just admit that right now this variant is super contagious and is spreading in schools,” Keller said. “Nobody wants to talk about that.”A one-size-fits-all policy won’t work, Ehlke said, but he hopes multiple districts could coordinate on a regional or county basis to make decisions and avoid “unnecessary chaos.”“I think this is an artificial divide,” Ehlke said of the tension between teachers and parents. “I think we need to make it clear that we are all in this together.”“It’s not an us versus them thing,” said Takiah Ogunlusi, an eighth-grade teacher in Griffin, Georgia. “That’s a big part of the conversation that’s missing: People don’t realize we [teachers] have children too.”Ogunlusi added it’s because she agrees with other parents that she chose to send her 11-year-old to in-person classes, but she has anxiety her oldest child will infect her other kids who are too young to be vaccinated.“The reality of the situation is that kids have contracted the virus over break,” Ogunlusi said. “At the very least, there should be a true remote option.” Advertisement     
 


Andrea Castellano, a parent who teaches in Brooklyn, also decided to keep her fifth-grader and eighth-grader home in Queens after the holidays. More than half of her third-grade class has been absent since classes resumed Jan. 3, and she’s just trying to get students to meet basic mental and physical wellness so they can focus on their academic achievement.Pitting teachers against parents is a conversation only some communities can afford, she said, because families of color have been disproportionately affected by COVID. Demanding that schools stay open ignores the potential effects on teachers and parents of color, too.“Those are the people that have also kept their children in remote as long as possible, and who are reluctant to send them back right now,” she said.Her children’s father has COVID right now and is isolated, so Castellano is gripped by concern that if they get sick, it will be because she brought the virus home from work.“The guilt I [would] have,” she said. “I stood outside my door yesterday. And I was like, ‘I don't want to go inside because I'm scared to give it to them.’”

On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection, President Joe Biden gave a speech condemning former president Donald Trump for his role in inciting violence and undermining democracy, a striking departure for the president who has spent his first year in office avoiding dwelling on his predecessor.Biden’s speech, delivered on Capitol Hill, carefully avoided naming the former president but focused on keeping the record straight on the violent pro-Trump insurrection and the threat to American democracy that Republicans have stoked in past years. Yet it was clear who he was talking about. He repeatedly brought up the “former president” and the lies he told before, during, and since the 2020 presidential election to try to undermine the results. It was Biden’s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office. Advertisement     “His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. He cannot accept that he lost,” Biden said. “For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election, he tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol.”His decision to focus on the former president comes as Democrats weigh whether anti-Trump messaging could sink them in the midterms and as they try to outline what their party stands for instead of only what they stand against. Ultimately, Biden’s (accurate) portrayal of Trump was an apparent shift to address the ongoing threats to democracy, including restrictive voting laws that ultimately undermine elections across the board.Biden’s tiptoe around actually naming Trump was obvious. The president himself addressed the decision. “I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked why he didn't say Trump's name. ""It's way beyond that.”In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack, Trump called Biden’s speech “political theater” and a “distraction.”""It looks like he saw the speech. I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something about what it looks like to meet the moment in the country,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in response to Trump’s statement during the press briefing Thursday. Advertisement     Psaki did not immediately respond to an inquiry by BuzzFeed News about some of the thinking around the speech, including whether Biden might talk about Trump more as the midterms approach.""Biden's right. This is a crisis in democracy,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a progressive consultant with Left Flank Strategies. “Coming up with an actual plan to solve it, which we don't have a ton of time left before the midterm elections, I think that's like a really crucial thing that a lot of people, especially progressives, feel a lot of urgency about."" He added that Biden’s most direct attempt to hold Trump accountable came as “a welcome development.”Perhaps no instance best encapsulates how striking it is for Biden to focus a speech so heavily on Trump than a comment he made last month — “I don’t think about the former president” — when asked about the report that Trump tested positive for COVID before a September 2020 debate.Biden has previously addressed Trump on certain matters. In December, he pointed out that Trump had taken a COVID-19 booster shot — ""one of the few things he and I agree on"" — before going on to condemn ""companies and personalities"" peddling lies about the pandemic. He obviously also struck a direct contrast on the campaign trail not only in his own election but in other contests since.""You can't tell the story of Jan. 6 without talking about the former president,” said Addisu Demise, an Oakland-based Democratic strategist. “[Trump] invited people to Washington, incited them to violence, I would say, and in my mind it would be a denial of history to erase him from the day.” Advertisement     Demise said he doesn't expect Biden's focus on Trump to carry into the coming weeks and months as Democrats prepare for the midterms and the next presidential election, because it would distract from talking about his own agenda and achievements. But rather, he said, it would have been ""malpractice"" not to talk about Trump's role in the attempted insurrection on its anniversary.Looking at the bigger picture, though, Demise said it wouldn't make sense for Biden to rag on Trump, who, despite his ongoing political pull, should not be the focus of this presidency.""He was elected in large part to turn the page on the Trump era. And if he continues to focus on that, it takes him away from his job, which is to focus not on yesterday, but on tomorrow,"" Demise said.Democrats have spent a lot of time working to keep the record straight on the events of Jan. 6 against efforts by Republicans to rewrite history, and Biden’s speech was true to that. From the start, Democrats built a detailed case illustrating Trump’s role in inciting the violence, including during the impeachment trial last year — which he was acquitted of by Republicans. Their efforts continue today: One of the commemorative events Democrats are hosting on the anniversary of the insurrection is a moderated discussion featuring the Democratic leaders of each chamber of Congress and renowned historians.""I think using this anniversary to stand up for our country, our ideals, and what we believe in as a nation is critical,” said Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist and former Biden adviser. “The scars of that day still haven't healed for so many, and part of the way we recover as a country is to ensure that our democracy stands.""

WASHINGTON — Democrats lined up to greet former vice president Dick Cheney in the House chamber Thursday, a rare moment of outreach to a onetime party villain who is now one of the few high-profile Republicans to fully acknowledge what happened before and during last year's fatal Capitol riots.His daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is under attack by her own party as she continues to speak out against former president Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Advertisement     House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro was one of several Democrats to pay their respect to the former vice president during a short procedural session in Congress marking the anniversary of the Capitol attack.“I believe he cares deeply about this country,” DeLauro told BuzzFeed News. “We have different views on issues. I think that's important that he's here. I think it speaks to the strength of the institution and the strength of our democracy.” ​“This isn't about partisanship,” she said. “This is about, you know, what this citadel of democracy represents, for him, for me, for Liz Cheney, for all of us here.”Reps. Lizzie Fletcher, David Cicilline, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Eric Swalwell also spoke to Dick Cheney.“In this fight, he’s an ally,” Swalwell said later. “And this fight, for the soul of America, is the only one that matters.”The former vice president, member of Congress, cabinet secretary, and White House official has not exactly been beloved by Democrats over the last half-century. Throughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Cheney was portrayed by Democrats in and out of Congress as the dark force driving the president and the functional Republican power center, from the Iraq War to any number of domestic political fights. But Cheney, and his now out-of-style brand of neoconservatism, is not aligned with where the party is today. Advertisement     The current Republican Party leadership, he told reporters Thursday, is “not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years.”The House of Representatives did not have scheduled votes Thursday, and many members have stayed out of DC this week. Some House Democrats served food to US Capitol Police officers and campus staff to thank them for their actions one year ago. But Republicans in particular were not eager to be at the Capitol for the first anniversary of the insurrection, where they inevitably would have had to face renewed questions about the actions party leaders took and conspiracies Trump hawked that inspired hundreds to riot.Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz are scheduled to hold a public response to the anniversary, after Trump canceled a press conference with the same agenda. Like other House Republicans, Greene and Gaetz skipped the ceremonial events Democrats held. They instead appeared on Steve Bannon’s War Room.“We’re ashamed of nothing. We’re proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 and we’re actually going to walk the grounds that patriotic Americans walked from the White House to the Capitol,” Gaetz said on the program. The two promised to make the same “legitimate arguments about election integrity” at Thursday’s press conference.Cheney was not the only Democratic villain of the early 2000s to make an unusual reappearance for the insurrection anniversary. Karl Rove, for years Bush’s top political adviser, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed condemning the riot “apologists” in the Republican Party for not being honest about what happened on Jan. 6. “If Democrats had done what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6, Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so,” he wrote. Advertisement     Republicans, instead, have been most merciless with Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee investigating the insurrection and a prime political target of Trump’s in this year’s elections. Cheney was removed from a Republican leadership position last year after voting for Trump’s impeachment.“My daughter can take care of herself,” the former vice president told reporters.

Like most people on Jan. 6, 2021, I was glued to my screen. I watched as the news of the riots at the Capitol played out on Twitter, on TV, in my group chats, and in my work Slack. The last year has been about understanding how the destructive event happened, why, and what happens next.Cynthia Rivera has been the exhibitions manager at the Bronx Documentary Center for eight and a half years. Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, she worked with photographers around the country on exhibitions related to issues that were central to the narrative in those four years — immigration, the climate crisis, and the “end of truth.” For Rivera, everything seemed connected: “We asked ourselves the question, is this a one-time event or is this a segue into something much bigger, much more chaotic, and the truth of what our democracy has become?” Advertisement  On Jan. 6, as a mob attacked the Capitol and assaulted police officers, some photojournalists who had planned on covering Trump’s morning rally realized they were in for much more. Many photographers were there for the Capitol riot. No one knew exactly what was going to happen or that people were going to storm the building, but they had gotten word that something might go down that day. ""The BDC spent a lot of time analyzing Trump's presidency, leading up to and during,” Rivera said. “It was a moment in history that seemed unreal, but we could also understand why this was happening and what led up to this moment.”Christopher Lee was in Washington that day photographing for Time magazine. ""There were a lot of photojournalists who were following the groundswell of conspiracy and anger. For me, it wasn't surprising, but it was shocking,"" he said. ""For a person who has a lot of experience covering traumatic events abroad and the violence that people can inflict on each other, I had the privilege of stepping away from that when it got too dangerous or difficult. As a native Texan and someone who lives and works in Texas, that quiet chaos and that anxiety really followed me back home [after Jan. 6]."" According to the Department of Justice, Texas constituted the second-highest number of people who were charged that day.“It wasn't until a year after the insurrection, of information unraveling, that we were able to have a full view of what happened that day,” Rivera said.We look at the exhibit, which opens in the Bronx later this month, one year after the riots.

WASHINGTON — Federal charges for the Jan. 6 insurrection began pouring in the day after the attack and haven’t stopped. The case count passed 700 just before the end of 2021. BuzzFeed News has tracked every case filed. One year in, here’s where the prosecution effort stands.The basics
 


The sprawling prosecution effort has been unprecedented in its scope. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday presented the latest statistics trying to convey the massive scale: More than 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants. Nearly 2,000 seized phones and other devices. More than 300,000 tips from the public. More than 20,000 hours of video footage. The government has routinely asked for extensions to the normal deadlines that apply to criminal cases, citing the scale of the prosecution effort and delays in developing a system to manage the massive amount of evidence.Judges and defense lawyers have at times pushed back, particularly in cases where alleged rioters were held in jail after their arrest. But for the most part, judges have allowed longer time frames. Some of the earliest cases are only just starting to wrap up. Mark Leffingwell of Seattle was the first person to face federal charges; he was arrested at the Capitol after punching two police officers. He entered a guilty plea in late October and is due to be sentenced on Feb. 10.New cases are still being filed, some rooted in tips sent to the FBI right after the attack. Take defendant Michael Oliveras of New Jersey. On Jan. 8, 2021, an anonymous tip came in about a Parler user who’d posted about being at the Capitol during the riot. The FBI matched the Parler account to a phone number linked to Oliveras. Citing that and other evidence, a prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against him on Dec. 8 — 11 months after the first tip.
 


Justice Department officials said in the days that followed the insurrection that they were prepared to prosecute anyone who committed a crime on Jan. 6. In a speech marking the first anniversary this week, Garland said the DOJ was still “committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law” — “there is no higher priority,” he said. The fact that most people who stormed the Capitol were allowed to leave and scatter across the country complicated that effort, but Garland said there was no deadline or case count milestone when they’d wind down.The government’s position is that between 2,000 and 2,500 people went inside the Capitol. That number doesn’t include people who assaulted police officers or members of the media outside. Prosecutors haven’t shown much appetite so far for charging people who crossed police barriers onto the restricted Capitol grounds but didn’t go inside or commit other crimes, although they have set precedent for that; Infowars host Owen Shroyer is being charged for being in a restricted area outdoors. On Jan. 6, Shroyer was with Infowars founder and right-wing activist Alex Jones, who hasn’t been charged.
 


The first plea deal became public in April, when heavy metal musician Jon Schaffer of Indiana pleaded guilty to two felonies for obstructing an official proceeding and going into the Capitol with a weapon (a can of bear spray). Schaffer had been a member of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing group that’s featured prominently in the government’s exploration of ties between extremist organizations and the insurrection. He agreed to cooperate and hasn’t been sentenced yet.The pace of guilty pleas has picked up since the summer. Prosecutors focused early plea deal offers on defendants they’d charged solely with misdemeanor crimes from the start; 150 of the 174 guilty pleas have been for those less serious categories of crimes, such as illegally being in the Capitol and parading. In 11 cases, prosecutors have agreed to let a defendant charged with a felony plead down to a misdemeanor.The US attorney’s office has also locked down guilty pleas from defendants in several high-profile cases involving more serious crimes: Jacob Chansley of Arizona, previously referred to as the “QAnon shaman,” who was photographed posing shirtless and wearing horns on the Senate floor, was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction. Four other members of the Oath Keepers are cooperating after pleading guilty to conspiracy. Former Olympic athlete Klete Keller is potentially facing two years in prison.
 


Two defendants opted to plead guilty to the full slate of crimes they were charged with instead of making a deal with prosecutors. Pleading guilty often comes with the benefit of having charges dropped, but defendants give up certain rights and may decide they don’t want to work with the government. Antionne Brodnax, a Virginia-based rapper known as Bugzie the Don, pleaded guilty to a set of misdemeanors for illegally going into the Capitol. He told the FBI he was filming a music video and used a photo of himself sitting on a SWAT vehicle in front of the Capitol as the cover of an album titled The Capital. Matthew Perna of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to a felony for obstructing Congress as well as misdemeanor counts; in a video filmed on Jan. 6, he said: ""lt's not over, trust me. The purpose of today was to expose Pence as a traitor."" Their respective lawyers did not return requests for comment.
 


Probation. Incarceration. Home detention. Financial penalties. Community service. Social media limits. The sentences handed down so far have largely reflected the nature of the crimes featured in the first wave of plea deals — minimal to no jail time for low-level misdemeanor offenses. Even in misdemeanor cases, there’s a lack of consensus among judges about what just punishment looks like for joining an insurrection. The small number of rioters who pleaded guilty to more serious crimes, like assaulting police and obstructing Congress, stared down far more time behind bars — setting the stage for higher-stakes sentencing hearings this year as more felony cases slowly start to resolve. Advertisement  
 


The first sentence to cross the five-year mark went to Robert Palmer of Florida, who pleaded guilty to repeatedly attacking police outside the Capitol using a fire extinguisher and a wooden plank. His plea agreement estimated less prison time on the table if he got credit for accepting responsibility. But at his Dec. 17 sentencing, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed with prosecutors that he’d blown up that opportunity by posting a fundraising pitch online after entering his guilty plea that suggested that he’d acted in self-defense; that narrative was false, Palmer admitted to the judge.
 


Once incarceration is off the table, what makes for a harsher or lighter sentence can be up for debate. Probation means resuming normal life with some conditions and restrictions. Danielle Doyle, whose former coworker at the Oklahoma City Thunder reported her to the FBI, pleaded guilty to the parading misdemeanor and received the shortest period of probation to date — two months. Most probation terms have ranged from one to three years. US District Judge Trevor McFadden also ordered Doyle to pay a $3,000 fine, a penalty that the government hadn’t asked for. Several judges have added financial consequences in the mix, with some saying they thought it might be more effective than a short stint in jail to make rioters feel some “hurt,” in the words of one judge.
 


As part of nearly every plea deal entered to date, defendants are agreeing to pay restitution to the feds — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and between $1,000 and $2,000 for a felony plea. Any fine levied by a judge as part of a sentence is on top of that. Advertisement  
 


The government’s cooperators include the four members of the Oath Keepers conspiracy case and Schaffer, Matthew Greene of New York, charged in one of the Proud Boys conspiracy cases, Gina Bisignano, a Beverly Hills salon owner who recorded video of her experience entering the Capitol, Keller, the former Olympian, and Josiah Colt of Idaho, who traveled to DC with several codefendants whose cases are pending. Another 101 defendants who took plea deals also agreed to a type of partial cooperation: submitting for a final interview or giving investigators a last look at their social media posts and any photos or videos on their phones.
 


Adam Johnson of Florida was captured in a viral photo smiling and waving as he carried a lectern with the speaker of the House’s seal through the rotunda. But his guilty plea was notable for other reasons. Prosecutors learned that Johnson had expressed plans to write a book about his experience at the Capitol — in the government’s words, to “potentially profit off his illegal conduct on January 6, 2021.” He became the first defendant who had to agree to a provision in his deal that he would give the feds any money he earned from content he produced related to Jan. 6 for five years.

Chansley is one of three defendants pursuing appeals of their sentences after pleading guilty. The others are Scott Fairlamb, a New Jersey man sentenced to 44 months in prison after he admitted to punching a police officer in the head, and Rasha Abual-Ragheb, also of New Jersey, who was sentenced to three years of probation and two months of home detention after pleading guilty to the parading misdemeanor. Plea deals significantly restrict a defendant’s ability to appeal; one of the only arguments they’re allowed to raise is that their lawyer was ineffective. All three cases are in the early stages of the appeal process.The crimes
 


Weapons that prosecutors say rioters brought with them or improvised, and in some cases used on police: guns, knives, bats, chemicals, stolen police gear, flagpoles, a “Trump 2020” sign, pieces of metal and wood, crutches, a skateboard, stun devices, a crowbar, and a firecracker.
 


Rioters engaged in violent clashes throughout the afternoon with officers from the US Capitol Police, the DC police force, and other federal agencies who responded to the scene. Police body camera videos made public as part of the prosecutions have provided harrowing first-person footage of the physical and verbal assaults on officers that day. The US attorney’s office has put the number of cases involving allegations of attacking or interfering with officers at more than 225, including those in which defendants are charged with the broader offense of civil disorder.
 


The assault on the Capitol was a mob event, but the overwhelming majority of defendants are being prosecuted as individuals. In a few dozen cases, however, prosecutors have presented evidence alleging that clusters of rioters planned to take action to disrupt Congress’s certification of the election. In addition to the Oath Keepers conspiracy case, which has steadily added more defendants over the past year, there are conspiracy cases involving purported members of other far-right groups, including the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters.
 


On Jan. 12, Michael Sherwin, then the acting US attorney in Washington, told reporters that his office had created strike teams to build cases involving more serious crimes related to the insurrection, including seditious conspiracy. But no one has been charged yet with sedition or the separate offense of insurrection; both are rarely brought charges, and the government would almost certainly face legal challenges to their use. Nearly 300 people have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a felony that can carry significant prison time.
 


The FBI continues to search for suspects in connection with pipe bombs found midday on Jan. 6 outside the respective headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. The feds have offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to an identification and have repeatedly promoted surveillance footage of a person seen wearing a sweatshirt and carrying a bag the night before.
 


Charging papers are full of social media posts and other alleged statements by defendants denouncing former vice president Mike Pence for what they believed was his betrayal of former president Donald Trump. But some of the most violent language was reserved for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Charging papers describe alleged rioters asking where they could find Pelosi or bragging later about going into her office. In the case of Pauline Bauer of Pennsylvania, prosecutors said she was captured on a police body camera saying words to the effect of, ""Bring Nancy Pelosi out here now. We want to hang that fucking bitch.” Steven Billingsley of Ohio was allegedly recorded on video saying, “No, we do want to hurt Pelosi. I do. Yeah, I would hang her from that big— You see that tree over there? We'd put a rope and hang her.” Richard Barnett of Arkansas was photographed with a foot on a desk in Pelosi’s office, and left a handwritten note that read, “Hey Nancy Bigo was here biotch [sic].”
 


The most common felonies are for obstructing an official proceeding, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, and assaulting police, which carries varying maximum penalties — as little as 1 year or as much as 20 years — depending on the extent of the violence, whether a weapon was used, or if other felony crimes were involved.
 


The vast majority of defendants are facing the same four base misdemeanor charges: illegally entering a restricted area, disorderly conduct in a restricted area, disorderly conduct in the Capitol, and parading or demonstrating in the Capitol. The first two counts carry up to a year behind bars, and the second two have maximum sentences of six months incarceration.The logistics
 


The federal district court in Washington has marshaled all of its resources to handle the flood of Capitol riot prosecutions, spreading the hundreds of cases across all of the active judges as well as senior judges (judges who are semiretired and can take lower caseloads). The latest available court statistics show that by September 2021, the number of new criminal cases filed in DC over the previous year had gone up by 83.9% compared to the year leading up to September 2020. President Joe Biden’s two nominees to the DC district court so far, Judges Florence Pan and Jia Cobb, were confirmed in the fall and have slowly started taking on cases.
 


Fights over which defendants should stay in jail after being arrested offered early perspective on how prosecutors were assessing the ongoing danger posed by alleged rioters and how judges were thinking about these cases. Some prominent conservatives, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have described incarcerated defendants as “political prisoners,” but the majority of people in pretrial detention are charged with assaulting police. The rest are either facing other serious felony charges, had their bond revoked for violating release conditions, or are in custody on unrelated criminal charges. Advertisement     
 


Evan Neumann, charged with assaulting police at the Capitol, fled the United States and is seeking asylum in Belarus. Michael Adams of Virginia, charged with misdemeanors for going into the Capitol, was arrested in April and released while his case was pending. He failed to appear for a July status hearing, however, and the judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest; he was also facing a warrant as of May for an unrelated offense in Virginia. His location remains unknown, according to his lawyer. A federal grand jury returned an indictment in July charging Jonathan Pollock of Florida with multiple counts of assaulting police at the Capitol; he has not been arrested.
 


On June 1, a prosecutor filed a notice in court that they were dropping charges filed in January against Christopher Kelly of New York. To support the original complaint, the FBI presented information provided by a confidential source about Facebook messages purportedly sent by Kelly that suggested he’d gone into the Capitol. A search warrant for the Facebook account yielded messages about being at the Capitol; charging papers against Kelly also featured two photos of a person identified as Kelly standing outside. A few months later, it appeared the government had revisited the strength of the evidence. In dismissing the case, the prosecutor wrote: “[U]pon reflection of the facts currently known to the government, the government believes that dismissal without prejudice at this time serves the interests of justice.” Kelly’s lawyer told BuzzFeed News in an email that his client “never entered the Capitol building at any time. This was completely contrary to the charges he faced so the Government had to dismiss.”
 


No defendant has succeeded yet in convincing a judge to toss out the charges against them. In a series of long-awaited decisions in December, five judges presiding over six different cases — including two conspiracy cases involving members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, and one involving a person charged with bringing a firearm to the Capitol — rejected legal challenges to the government’s decision to bring the felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in connection with the events of Jan. 6. These rulings came from a collection of judges whose pathways to the bench were politically diverse: two were nominated by Trump and the other three by former president Barack Obama. (Two defendants have died while their cases were pending.) Advertisement     
 


No one charged in connection with Jan. 6 has gone to trial yet, but dates are on the calendar in several dozen cases, including the Oath Keepers conspiracy case. Two defendants are set for trial as early as February: Robert Gieswein of Colorado, who is charged with repeatedly assaulting police with chemical spray and wielding a baseball bat as he made his way to the Capitol, and Guy Reffitt of Texas, who is charged with bringing a handgun to the Capitol.
 


Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House of Representatives for inciting the insurrection, but he was acquitted in February after a trial in the Senate. He hasn’t faced criminal charges. Hoping to find some other legal route to hold him accountable, Democrats in Congress and police officers who responded to the riots have filed civil lawsuits, arguing that he conspired to interfere with the certification of the election and that he’s liable for the physical and emotional injuries they sustained. A judge is set to hear arguments on Jan. 10 on motions filed by Trump’s initial push to get three of these cases tossed out. ●

What if, later today, you found a pipe bomb outside? And what if the bomb were real, not some hoax or mistake? And what if the bomb had been there for hours — maybe you’d cut through an alley and walked right near it, or maybe you’d even passed the bomber with your dog on a normal night on your own street, and not even known that explosives were inches away from your body?What if the bomb was outside your office, and there was another one, at the office up the street?What if, in the absence of resolution, the only reasonable conclusion is that the bomb was meant for you?That’s exactly a situation that’s unfolded in Washington. For four months, the FBI and reporters have posted silent, eerie, looping security footage of an “unknown individual” in a hoodie and Nike Air Max Speed Turfs, walking the nighttime streets of Capitol Hill — in an alley, then out, stopping, then gone. Authorities believe this person placed pipe bombs at both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5. There are urgent ads with grainy screengrabs of the person around the city asking for information, and escalating rewards alongside direct-to-camera appeals. “No arrests have been made,” Washington police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday during a congressional hearing. “No suspects have been identified.” Advertisement  One Democrat described every job she’d ever had as preparing her for different points of her life and career, with an exception. “I don’t think anyone at the DNC would tell you that they were prepared to be a target,” she said. “It was, frankly... No one can prepare you for that.”At midday on Jan. 6, a woman running an errand happened to spot what looked like a bomb outside the RNC and told the building’s security guards. “Holy shit, it is a bomb,” she overheard one shout.
 


“I'll never forget this as long as I live,” a Republican official said in a recent interview. He’d been walking into a meeting in Florida, where the committee was holding events, and received a call from the party’s operations head, even before the cops arrived. “Hey.” A pause. “We have to evacuate the building. I'm letting you know. It’s currently happening. There was a device found outside.” Advertisement  “I was like, ‘OK. Do we know anything about it yet?’”“It’s definitely a bomb.”“I’m trying to wrap my head around this — like, maybe he’s wrong!”In Washington, waves of police and federal officials descended on the RNC: the bomb squad, the FBI, dogs, everything. They evacuated the entire block, including the few dozen Republican staffers there that day. At that point on Jan. 6, a person waiting outside the buildings said, people were still getting off the Metro and walking around with kids in strollers, just a few blocks away from the east side of the Capitol. Then, watching it all unfold, she noticed something strange: “sirens going past us instead of toward us.”The rally to pressure Congress into overturning Donald Trump’s election defeat had become a mob, barreling into and past police barricades — broadcast in real time, blood spilling on the white steps — as senators spoke inside the Capitol about certifying the results. This is the forward-rewind unfolding of the insurrection: making sense of the entire situation took hours, then deepened with days, and is still hard to process in full. The cop getting crushed in the doorway, the crowd chanting “hang Mike Pence,” the rioters beating another cop with Americans flags, the video of lawmakers hustling toward elevators. As the woman waiting outside the RNC that day put it, “Only in retrospect did you place yourself in time.”
 


That afternoon, they'd locate a second bomb at the DNC, the police would evacuate some of the congressional office buildings, the authorities would detonate the bombs, the media would begin reporting about the devices. The Democrat said she’d actually heard that the bomb was really a bomb from the news — nearly everyone was working remotely because of the pandemic, and the day was chaotic. It had begun differently, busily: Democrats were celebrating Georgia senate wins the night before and working on Merrick Garland’s nomination that day.“I remember hearing from CNN and others, I think CNN was reporting it as breaking news that these were actual pipe bombs,” the Democrat said. “It was shocking when it was an actual bomb.”One way of considering the party committees is as a barometer of political health in American society: It’s not good. Over the last half-decade, they’ve become places where you might experience conspiracy theories, real email hacks, and finally, actual bombs. And you don’t have to particularly like the RNC or DNC to not want the people who work there to die in an explosion. If you talk to some political operatives — and this is a sample of just a few people, not everyone — you may find either a wearied acceptance or real anxiety. “You learn how to deal with them, and that sounds like a terrible thing, but you communicate, you stay in contact with the security officials,” the Democrat said about “suspicious packages” and threats, and the way it can be complicated and time-consuming to fully understand what’s going on. But, she also said, “something just this scary hasn’t happened to us where we had a real bomb outside of the building.”After a decade that included the WikiLeaks nightmare in 2016 and congressional baseball shooting in 2017, many political entities have added all manner of security protocol, both digital and physical. Only weeks before Jan. 6, the RNC upgraded its security cameras; some of the first images of the bomb suspect came from their footage. These days, they also have a system that can blast emergency alerts to employees simultaneously three different ways, as in: “RNC important message: Capitol Police are investigating a security concern near RNC headquarters in DC. Please remain away from the building.” Advertisement  “Is that now?” one of the Republicans said recently when it was read to him.That was the first alert the party sent on Jan. 6 at 1:32 p.m., as police and operations personnel cleared the building.The Democrat said she experienced the strange displacement of not being physically near colleagues because of the pandemic, which on the one hand, was good, given the nature of the problem. On the other, “We weren’t together, and we haven't been together for about a year now, right?”
 


There still is no way of knowing if the explosives had anything to do with the attack on the Capitol, or if it was a horrific coincidence; there aren’t any known suspects. There has, however, been an effort to minimize the chaos of the day. Since January, Trump has said little about the violence or the threat of more on Jan. 6 — including the bombs — all of it directed toward lawmakers, police officers, or fellow citizens. He still sends statements about how the election was stolen from him and has remarked that people like Pence didn’t do enough to help him — writing from a place where there will seemingly never be resolution or regret. In his wake, other Republican politicians and supporters have advanced the idea that the people inside the Capitol might not have been pro-Trump, or that the event everyone watched on TV might not have been that bad; others have opted to just move on. “I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,” Kevin McCarthy said outside the White House on Wednesday, as Trump continues questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. “I think that is all over with.” Advertisement  Meanwhile, one of the Republicans I spoke with remains shaken by something that happened on Jan. 6, unrelated to the pipe bombs or bombing suspect. As you may have seen, police arrested an Alabama man with 11 Molotov cocktails, lots of ammo, and handwritten notes about specific public officials. Police claim that when the man returned to his parked truck that evening, he told them that the mason jars in his truck contained a specific mixture of chemicals that works like napalm. For the Republican, just the idea of a weapon like that, used against anyone...“The stuff blows up, it would stick to their skin, like burn their skin off. OK, like, wow. That’s something,” he said, with emotion. “For people you don’t even know, that’s something.”As bad as Jan. 6 was, and nothing can really compare to multiple deaths and the visual of the smoky Capitol, the prevailing takeaway when you think hard about the day and closely examine the videos and details is how much worse it could have been: What if police hadn't evacuated lawmakers? But it’s true even in accidental ways. What if someone had kicked one of the bombs? What if nobody had found them, and a bomb exploded on Jan. 8 during the national security panic we were already having? Imagine if someone had rear-ended the truck with this homemade napalm inside.One detail that got a little lost in the overlapping chaos and compressed timelines: The police found the Molotov cocktails when they evacuated all the buildings around the RNC; he had parked on a side street nearby. ●

One year after former president Donald Trump's supporters tried to overturn an election, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a dire warning at the scene of the attack: The threat to democracy and the potential for political violence continues, driven by new, Republican-led voter restrictions across the country.“Those who stormed this Capitol, and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy,” Biden said. “They didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage."" Advertisement     He asked: ""Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?""Both Biden and Harris emphasized how, in the aftermath of the attempted insurrection, the fragility of American democracy and the need to actively defend it has been clear, evoking hard-won battles for the vote by Black civil rights leaders.""If we do not defend it,” Harris said, “Democracy simply will not stand.""One year on, there are hundreds of criminal cases stemming from the riot winding their way through the court system. Far-right extremism continues to adapt and worm its way into the mainstream. And Republicans continue to push conspiracy theories around the election and stall voting rights reforms in the Senate. Advertisement     “New laws are being written not to protect the vote but to deny it,” Biden said. ""Not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it. Not to strengthen and protect our democracy. Because the former president lost, instead of looking at election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections. It’s wrong. It’s undemocratic.”He continued: “Let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results.""Biden and Harris made the case that the Jan. 6 attack was not only a physical threat to democracy but that the election denial ideology behind the attack also spurred a series of voter restriction bills from Republican legislators across the country.In the past year, 19 states have passed laws that restrict voter access, on the same basis that drove hundreds, including groups of white supremacists, to storm the Capitol grounds, assault and demean police officers, and hunt for elected officials while a gallows hung on the Capitol lawn: the false narrative, pushed by Trump, that Biden stole the election.Biden called Trump out in his address on Thursday morning, pointing to his actions spurring on the attackers on Jan. 6 and his continued attempts to spread misinformation and inflame election denial conspiracy theories. Advertisement     “For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election. He tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. But they failed. They failed,” Biden said.“His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,” he said. ""He cannot accept that he lost.""Harris compared the need to defend democracy from extremists today to the blood spilled in the battle for civil rights in decades past.“What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building,” she said. “What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.”“On Jan. 6, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful,” Harris said.“The 'big lie' didn't just drive the insurrection,” said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice. ""It has driven a wave of anti-voter laws across the country, laws to restrict voting and pull cut back on voting rights and laws to change who does the counting — sabotage on top of voter suppression.""Waldman said Biden has been “more muted than would have been ideal” about voting rights and the threats to democracy over the past year, but that he sees the president being more proactive now: between his remarks this week and plans to travel to Georgia next week specifically to talk about voting rights reform.Voting rights advocates said it was important to hear Biden clearly and specifically condemn anti-democratic forces. But they ultimately have their eyes on key voting rights legislation. Advertisement     Protecting American democracy, voting rights advocates said, means going beyond holding those responsible for Jan. 6 responsible for their actions — the real goal is passing those voter protection measures, which a majority of Republicans in the Senate oppose. Biden directly pointing to voting reform bills as a means to stem the tide of anti-voter access bills underwritten by election denial ideology was a welcome sign to voting rights advocates.“Republicans will say, Oh, he's politicizing this solemn day of remembrance or whatever,” Waldman said. “Every major speech by presidents that are effective at a moment like this have a political purpose,” he added, referring to the Gettysburg Address and Bill Clinton’s speech after the Oklahoma City bombing, a right-wing terrorist attack.On the eve of the anniversary, Rev. Leah Daughtry, campaign manager with Fighting for Our Vote, said that she wanted to see Biden make a clear connection between the events of Jan. 6 and the need for voting rights protection to counter the ongoing threats to elections and democracy in the US.“I want to see Joe Biden remind us of who we are, of what our principles are, what our higher calling is, and then I want to see him tie that to the existential threat that we have right now,” Daughtry said. “That we shouldn't take for granted that what happened on Jan. 6 can never happen again. That he is fully committed with everything that he and the administration has to ensure that our voting rights are protected.”Two bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would represent the most significant defenses to voters' rights since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. The first bill would set national standards for elections, outlaw gerrymandering, enshrine the right to vote by mail, and standardize voter ID laws. The second would reestablish antidiscrimination protections stripped away from the Voting Rights Act by two Supreme Court decisions in recent years, which has left voters of color, in particular, vulnerable to having their access to voting cut off by state and local officials. Advertisement     “In response to Jan. 6, it would stop the voter suppression wave,” Waldman said.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the Senate to pass voting rights reforms in response to Jan. 6 in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Monday.“January 6th was a symptom of a broader illness — an effort to delegitimize our election process and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration — they will be the new norm,” Schumer wrote.Senate Democrats support both bills — but that’s not enough to get past Republicans, in an evenly divided Senate where it takes 60 votes to pass any legislation because of the filibuster. The current challenge for Biden and Senate Democrats is to convince Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to support changes to Senate procedure that would provide an exception to filibuster rules, preventing Republicans from shooting down voting rights legislation.“I mean, it's just been a series of unfortunate events and fumbles,” New Georgia Project CEO Nsé Ufot said about how the Biden administration has handled the voting reform bills. Advertisement     While voting rights advocates acknowledge that Biden may not have more forcefully called out Republicans for stalling voting reform — the way activists have — because he may need them on his side to pass other aspects of his agenda, Ufot said she’s disappointed he hasn’t used his years of experience and relationships in the Senate to push harder for voting rights bills.“I did not serve four decades in the United States Senate. I can't whip votes. I can't get my former colleagues to get rid of the filibuster. They can,” she said. “So there are things that I can and should be doing, as an organizer, as an activist, as a citizen. And there are things that only the president of the United States can do.”Daughtry, by contrast, said she thought Biden has been forceful already in pushing for the bills. ""I want to see him continue to double down with his colleagues, his former colleagues in the Senate, to put the full resources of the administration to work in ensuring that we can pass voting rights legislation,"" she said.“The buck stops with the United States Senate, and they've got to do their jobs to preserve democracy,” Daughtry said. “It is not the president's job alone.”

Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported. Advertisement     Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims.""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover. Advertisement     The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him. Advertisement     “The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture.It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

Far-right domestic extremists like those who attacked the US Capitol a year ago have faced criminal charges from law enforcement and crackdowns from social media companies. But they have not gone away.On the contrary, they have evolved and adopted new strategies while regrouping, recruiting, and muscling their way into the mainstream with worrying success, experts say. And their ranks are growing. Advertisement     “Many of us thought these groups would splinter and fall apart and go underground after the FBI started going after them. But that hasn’t really been the case,” Heidi Beirich, cofounder and chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit focused on transnational hate and far-right movements, told BuzzFeed News.Indeed, as the country marks the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history and prepares for the consequential midterm elections in the fall — where extremists, such as MAGA supporters, could again try to undermine the will of voters — extremism researchers and government officials are warning that homegrown extremists pose a greater threat to our democracy than they did before Jan. 6, 2021. They just look a bit different now.“The threat of domestic extremism today is perhaps less obvious. We’re not seeing the Proud Boys organize massive marches in Washington, DC, or militias storming capitol buildings every weekend. But what’s happening is gravely serious,” Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told BuzzFeed News.In a new report published Tuesday, Holt wrote that domestic extremists were “battered by the blowback [they] faced after the Capitol riot, but not broken by it. In fact, the sentiments espoused by domestic extremist causes are as public and insidious as ever.”  Advertisement     Far-right extremists, he told BuzzFeed News, are increasingly seeking legitimacy by latching onto mainstream conservative causes; they are taking a decentralized approach, preferring to operate in small groups or cells; and they are switching their focus from national actions to hyperlocal initiatives, like focusing on school board and city council meetings.There have been several reports in recent months about far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, including members of the neo-fascist street gang the Proud Boys, showing up and intimidating officials making decisions on health measures and school initiatives at community meetings.Holt’s report highlights how extremists’ ideas are increasingly finding fertile ground among disaffected conservatives and leading voices in the Republican Party who are teaming with them to fight “culture wars” on topics like vaccines, race, and education.Beirich said that shift is a serious cause for alarm.“When I look back at the last year, the thing that I find most astounding isn’t really about the groups we’d label extremist — it’s about what’s happened with the Republican party… The infiltration of extremists into its ranks,” she said.
 


She cited extremist and white supremacist ideas such as the “great replacement theory” — the false idea that white people are being purposely replaced by nonwhite immigrants — being peddled by GOP politicians and Fox News commentators as evidence of the radicalization of the conservative right and “extremism going mainstream.” Advertisement     “I’m hard-pressed to even call them fringe ideas anymore,” she said. “They’re not confined to extremists. You can’t call it a fringe idea; it’s a mainstream idea among conservatives.”The experts’ concerns were backed Tuesday by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who said that authorities over the past year “have improved and strengthened our approach to combating this dynamic, evolving threat.”In the wake of the pro-Trump mob attack on the Capitol, President Joe Biden made combating domestic violent extremism one of his top priorities and enlisted leaders across government agencies to help. Department of Justice and FBI officials, in particular, have led the charge. They have testified in front of Congress on several occasions about the threat posed by extremists, particularly those on the far-right side of the political spectrum. With Jan. 6, they are at the forefront of not only the festering extremist problem but also one of the largest criminal investigations in US history.More than 700 people, including several with military experience and many associated with white supremacist and anti-government extremist groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, have been charged in the sweeping federal probe into the Capitol attack that was blamed for the deaths of five people and dozens more injuries. The images of the rioters stomping on Capitol police officers, crashing through barricades, bashing in windows with poles adorned with the American Flag, and storming the halls of Congress are seared into the American consciousness.While the Biden administration has made some strides in the fight against domestic violent extremists, Mayorkas said the threat of them remains “very grave.”Some experts think the US government was slow to respond and will have trouble tackling the problem of extremism.Beirich said authorities should have taken steps a decade ago to quash the rise of far-right extremism and white nationalism, “when this stuff really was on the fringe [and] it could have had a massive impact.” Advertisement     Now, with it so deeply entrenched in the mainstream political right and white supremacist and anti-government groups backing them up with threats of violence, she fears it may be too late to turn the tide.“If 2024 is contested like 2020 was,” she added, referring to the upcoming midterm elections, “we’re going to have major civil unrest in this country.”

Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up. Advertisement     Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree?JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago. Advertisement     SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character. Advertisement     
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what???? Advertisement     SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

115,“Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?” President Joe Biden asked during a speech at the US Capitol.,"


Australian authorities canceled the visa of the world's No. 1 tennis player, Novak Djokovic, on Thursday after he failed to provide appropriate proof regarding his exemption from rules requiring foreigners to be vaccinated, officials said.The decision was made after the Serbian player was questioned overnight at a Melbourne airport by federal officials amid widespread anger Down Under that he was granted a medical exemption from COVID vaccination to play at the Australian Open. Advertisement     “The visa for Novak Djokovic has been canceled,” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on the Australian breakfast news show Sunrise. “Obviously that follows a review of the exemption that was provided through the Victorian government process. They were looking at the integrity and the evidence behind it.”“It’s a matter for him whether he wishes to appeal that, but if a visa is canceled somebody will have to leave the country,” he added.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was made out of the desire to continue to be vigilant in the pandemic.
 


A source told BuzzFeed News that Djokovic and his coaching team were still at the airport and planned to file a legal appeal, but they did not expect to be successful.“They expect to be on the flight back home later in the day,” the source said.The top-ranked singles tennis player, who is seeking a record 21st Grand Slam title, was quizzed by border officials for several hours after he landed late Wednesday Australian time.According to Reuters, his father told Serbian media that the player was made to wait alone in a room at the airport under ​​armed guard pending a final decision.“Not the most usual trip Down Under,” Djokovic coach Goran Ivanisevic posted on Instagram from the airport at around 5 a.m.
 


Djokovic’s beliefs and behavior have made headlines throughout the pandemic. In April 2020, he said he was opposed to vaccines and that he wouldn’t want to be required to receive a shot in order to travel. Just months later, he and his wife tested positive for COVID after he organized and played in exhibition matches that flouted social distancing recommendations. In October 2021, he said that questions about his vaccination status were “inappropriate.” Advertisement     The tournament’s defending champion had surprised many Tuesday when he posted on social media that he had been granted an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia. But, as Melbourne’s Age newspaper first reported, it was not clear whether Djokovic had brought sufficient evidence to prove his exemption reason.Under Australian law, foreigners traveling into the country must have a visa and be fully vaccinated. Tennis Australia and officials in Victoria, where Melbourne is located, made similar requirements for players who wanted to participate in the Open without first undertaking a mandatory 14-day quarantine.But Australian immunization officials had outlined some temporary vaccine exemptions for its citizens, which include people who have had a PCR-confirmed case of COVID in the last six months. It is not clear if these apply to foreigners seeking to enter Australia, but tennis officials had pointed to these exemptions in their decision to allow Djokovic to participate.That Djokovic was granted an exemption to play in Melbourne, which endured one of the longest lockdowns in the world as Australia sought to keep COVID cases at zero prior to widespread vaccination, caused a massive outcry in the country.Tennis and Victorian officials stressed his application had gone through a “double blind” review process, but large sections of the Australian public and media railed against the decision. Advertisement     “I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in,” former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis wrote on Twitter.Asked about the tennis player’s exemption at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Djokovic would need to ""provide acceptable proof"" for his claim that he couldn’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.""We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,"" Morrison said. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else, and he'll be on the next plane home.""On Wednesday, Morrison’s government indicated that they would have a say on whether Djokovic would be allowed into the country.“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said in a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone.”“No individual competing at the Australian Open will be afforded any special treatment,” Andrews said.Hunt, the health minister, said the rules were tough but fair. ""Australians have had to do it tough,"" Hunt said, ""and Australians in many different states and territories have had to show their vaccination records in some cases to enter premises and cafés and other things, and it's not unreasonable to have exactly the same requirement for all who enter this country.""

Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly. Advertisement     
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning. Advertisement     The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered.Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites? Advertisement     Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account. Advertisement     
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life. Advertisement     Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost.Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible. Advertisement     
 


“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him. Advertisement     “The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture.It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

Twelve people — eight of whom were children — died Wednesday morning after a massive fire ripped through a Philadelphia apartment building, officials said.The duplex was owned by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, whose properties are home to about 80,000 low-income residents.At a news conference, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called it ""without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history.""""Losing so many kids is just devastating,"" he added. ""Keep these babies in your prayers.""There were 26 people living in the building, and the death toll was feared to rise due to the ongoing nature of recovery efforts, First Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said. At least eight people escaped on their own, and two — one adult, and one child — were transported to the hospital. Advertisement     City officials said in a statement Wednesday night that one child who was rescued from the building later died.""It was terrible — I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,"" Murphy said. ""We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.""Officials earlier on Wednesday, as recovery efforts at the scene were ongoing, had given a death toll of 13. They revised that number to 12 fatalities Wednesday night.There were at least four smoke detectors in the building, but they didn't go off during the fire, Murphy said. According to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, he added, four smoke detectors had been installed in 2019, and two more were installed in 2020.The agency's CEO, Kelvin A. Jeremiah, said in a statement that the building's two units ""were last inspected in April 2021 and May 2021 respectively,"" and that ""all smoke detectors were operating properly at that time.""“This unimaginable loss of life has shaken all of us at PHA,"" Jeremiah said. ""It is too early for us to say more.""The cause of the fire is under investigation, though it is ""not necessarily considered suspicious,"" Murphy said. Though he could not say whether the building was overcapacity, he said 26 residents is ""a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.""Dinesh Indala, Philadelphia Housing Authority's Vice President of Operations, told CBS Philly they had not been aware how many residents were living there, saying the ""count for the number of people on that property is too high"" but adding that it could be due to ""people coming and visiting"" for the holidays. Advertisement     The mayor, meanwhile, urged the public not to ""make judgment on the number of people living in the house.""""Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,"" Kenney said. ""Maybe they were relatives or people that needed to be sheltered.""The names of those who died were not immediately released, but heartbroken neighbors said they remembered seeing some of the youngest victims playing outside over the years.“I knew some of those kids — I used to see them playing on the corner,” 34-year-old neighbor Dannie McGuire told the Associated Press. “And some of those kids have lived here as long as us.”

Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported. Advertisement     Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims.""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover. Advertisement     The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up. Advertisement     Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree?JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago. Advertisement     SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character. Advertisement     
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what???? Advertisement     SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly. Advertisement     
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning. Advertisement     The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered.Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites? Advertisement     Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account. Advertisement     
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life. Advertisement     Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost.Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible.

“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

Leah Frances is a photographer behind a popular Instagram account, American Squares, and the author of a book with the same name. “I couldn’t believe that name wasn’t taken,” she told us from her home outside Easton, Pennsylvania. Frances got started on Tumblr in 2013, after seeing some photographs by Stephen Shore when she worked at the Wall Street Journal.“I was so blown away that I went out and bought a camera and flew out to LA and walked around taking pictures.”Her work focuses on the interiors of diners — the very American restaurants modeled after the café cars on trains and grew in popularity in the early half of the 20th century. “My photographs are mostly empty of people, yet pushed-back chairs or half-finished meals on tables show that life did occur here,” she said. “Pictured are scenes where things once happened, never happened, or might still happen. Yet I don’t want us to be buried in collective amnesia: Things were never ‘normal.’ For example, if a political figure, even if they’re wealthy, if they sit beside you at a diner and eat a $4.99 hamburger suddenly they’re authentic. They’re working class. But of course, we all know it’s more complicated than that.” Advertisement  
 


Frances said her interest in her subject matter comes from having grown up consuming a steady diet of mid-century American film, though she lived in Canada. “I was really curious about how those symbols I saw growing up were represented today,” she said. “Someone once told me that my work is like that of an anthropologist, finding things and symbols that are from that time and comparing them to how they feel today.”“I feel like if you don't know my work, it reads as nostalgia, which I'm kind of trying to get away from,” she said. “There's a whole other side of it.” Advertisement  The locations she chooses are particular. Left behind by declining economies, the diners also reference an idealized American mythology. “I do always frequent the places I photograph, which I think is important,” she said. “I like to sit and watch and spend time and spend money and experience the place while I'm taking these photographs.”We’re sharing her photos here as we start 2022, and how businesses and communities are faring in the neverending pandemic years.

125,"The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.","Viewers of Netflix's latest offering Don't Look Up got an interesting surprise recently when they realized a phone number used in the movie actually belonged to a sex hotline. The apocalypse movie, which follows the world's reaction to the news that a planet-ending comet is heading straight for Earth, has been the talk of social media since its release last month. The first focus was, of course, the ensemble cast, which is made up of A-list heavy hitters such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and Ariana Grande. Then it was the seemingly real-life parallels as scientists tried in vain to convince the world that the meteor was real and would have devastating global effects — something which appeared to reflect global warming. But the conversation surrounding the movie recently took a turn for the unexpected when viewers decided to call a phone number that's advertised in the movie. At one point during the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Dr. Randall Mindy, appears in a commercial for tech company BASH in order to put people's minds at ease about the comet. The commercial then shows a phone number, promising ""peace of mind"" if viewers should call. So, of course, some people watching at home thought they'd investigate... Upon finding out that it directed the caller to a sex hotline, one viewer tweeted: ""Kudos to you Don't Look Up to having the BASH hotline for their asteroid stress prevention hotline being linked to a Hot Singles in Your Area phone number."" It's not yet confirmed if use of the phone number was intentional. However, director Adam McKay recently revealed that he'd purposefully left a shot of the film's camera crew in the final edit after people assumed it was an error."

Andy — like many — rang in the new year with ~perhaps~ one too many drinks. And while a boozy New Year’s Eve might not seem far from the ordinary, it just so happened that Andy’s night was broadcast live to the nation. In the unlikely event that you missed it, the beloved host was the center of attention this weekend following several comments he made live on CNN during New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the night’s festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila, which — toward the latter half of the four-and-a-half-hour broadcast — escalated into chaos (or TV gold, whichever you prefer). As the alcohol seemingly got to work, Andy burst into several on-air rants, taking aim at a number of public figures ranging from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to showbiz pals like Ryan Seacrest. However, the night arguably peaked when he turned his attention to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. Despite Anderson’s failed attempts to defuse the situation, Andy declared live on-air that de Blasio was the “crappiest” mayor in NYC history, and went on to tell CNN viewers that “the only thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has been.” Inevitably, clips of the live moment wound up going viral. And while the drunken rant was largely well received by those who tuned in, not everyone was so impressed with Andy’s good-humored outburst. In fact, the backlash prompted a number of reports which falsely claimed that Andy had been fired by the network, with one article even quoting “TV insiders” who alleged that staff from CNN were “embarrassed and angry.” Although, these reports were swiftly debunked by a representative for CNN who informed BuzzFeed News that they are firmly standing by their host and are excited to welcome him back for next year’s installment. And now that the dust has finally settled, Andy is setting the record straight on exactly what went down behind the scenes. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show on Tuesday, the Bravo star hit back at the false reports that staff at CNN were left “angry” by his NYE antics. After Howard asked if he had seen the reports, Andy slammed the “unnamed sources” responsible for “making up” the claims and proceeded to shed some light on the situation. “Listen, I will not be shamed for having fun on New Year’s Eve. That’s why I’m there. That’s why they bring me there,” he began. Offering a little more clarity, Andy highlighted that the viral clips that attracted the most backlash — namely, his de Blasio rant — were taken from the final portion of the broadcast. “It’s a four-and-a-half-hour show,” he said. “The booze started kicking in at around 11:30, so everyone is focusing on kind of the last 45 minutes or hour that we were on the air.” “I kicked into high gear with 45 minutes left, so we had done 15 interviews before that point, you know,” he added. Taking a stand against the criticism, Andy made it clear once again that he doesn't feel bad for ringing in the new year with a bit of laughter. “I won’t be shamed for it! I had a blast! Anderson had a blast! We left and we were like, ‘That was fun, what a fun New Year’s Eve,’” the host explained. “No apologies for my drinking on New Year’s Eve. None.” The TV star was subsequently asked to shed light on how his performance really went down with CNN execs. In response, he revealed the single piece of advice he was offered by the president of CNN, Jeff Zucker. “The only direction that I get every year from Jeff Zucker is: ‘Have fun,’” Andy said. “There you go. That is my job.” And, according to Andy, providing CNN viewers with some festive joy was his top priority — this year, more than ever. “It was not only a middling year,” he explained. “It ended in a car crash of COVID and Betty White dying on the day of New Year’s Eve, who everyone loved. So it was like, we’ve gotta kick it into gear. We’ve gotta have fun. A lot of people are at home spending their evenings with us.” But, while he may not be sorry, many of us know that a drunken night doesn't often go without consequences the next day. And so — like many others — Andy had a couple of regrets on Jan. 1. Speaking on his own SiriusXM radio show on Monday, the Watch What Happens Live host revealed that his “only regret” was making fun of Ryan Seacrest. Discussing the dig once again with Howard Stern on Tuesday, Andy revealed that he dropped the showbiz mogul a text the next day to apologize for throwing him “under the bus” on air. “I did wind up kind of starting to throw ABC under the bus, and that is my only regret from the night,” he said. ""Because I really like Ryan Seacrest. He’s a really nice guy."" He admitted: “I was kind of enjoying the rant! I was like, ‘It’s really fun being on CNN and just ranting like a nutty guy! This is fun!’ So I kept going, and that I felt bad about. And I texted Ryan the next morning.” Well, it seems that all’s well that ends well. And if Andy’s setting the tone for 2022, I think we can expect a lot of fun."

WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

130,"Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl. Experts say it’s medically implausible and the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.","


A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project.The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that. Advertisement     “It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect.In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.”This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023. Advertisement  Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California.But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself. Advertisement  A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later.Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input. Advertisement  The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?”
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water. Advertisement  “If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?”
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was.Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river. Advertisement  “Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.”The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.” Advertisement  While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions.“Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day, as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads and accounts for the majority of cases across the nation.The 1,017,376 cases recorded on Jan. 3 by the New York Times come with a few caveats: The long holiday weekend caused a backlog in reporting cases, which boosted the number reported on a single day. Meanwhile, testing has been hard to access, which means more people may be positive than what has been recorded. Advertisement     What we do know is that the country is in a very steep growth period for new cases, with a seven-day rolling average of 480,916. This new phase of the coronavirus pandemic has strained testing availability, disrupted businesses, and frustrated those who are fully vaccinated but catching Omicron, although the vaccines are reducing serious illness and death.
 


Still, the number of people hospitalized with COVID is surging past the peak of the Delta variant wave in early September 2021, and the percentage of PCR tests turning up positive is at the highest it’s ever been during the pandemic, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Advertisement     Bay Area resident Brittany McCulley woke up with a sniffly nose, itchy throat, and a minor cough Tuesday morning and immediately went to get tested for COVID. The 22-year-old hairstylist is 27 weeks pregnant, fully vaccinated, and received a booster dose to protect her from the virus. The test was positive.“I immediately started crying,” McCulley told BuzzFeed News, adding that she felt “absolutely horrified,” “scared,” and “exhausted” by the news. “I’m tired of people acting like nothing is going to affect them, that if they get it, it’s fine because it’ll be ‘mild,’ while it poses serious risks to other people around them.”
 


McCulley will now miss work and two prenatal doctor’s appointments over the next 10 days.“I’m going to struggle to pay bills now,” she said.She believes she was exposed at work because coworkers have also begun to feel sick. McCulley said her major concern is potential complications to her pregnancy, such as preterm labor (a risk researchers have stressed for pregnant people who contract the virus). Advertisement     People such as McCulley, who tested positive after the holidays, posted on social media about their need to change flights at the last minute or voiced concern that family members may also test positive.
 


Doctor's appointments, school schedules, and employers have all been thrown into a confusing reality about how to best mitigate the virus and continue in any form of normalcy. Those testing positive also said they are feeling ashamed of putting colleagues and loved ones at risk.“I’m frustrated more than anything because I wish I hadn’t exposed any of my coworkers, but I didn’t know,” said Lark W., who works at a rock climbing gym in Salt Lake City.Lark (who did not share their last name for privacy reasons) is fully vaccinated and has a booster shot scheduled for next week. They were exposed to COVID on Dec. 26 and took at-home tests on Dec. 29 and 30, each of which returned a negative result. Advertisement     “I did the best I could with the resources I had,” the 22-year-old told BuzzFeed News.Citing the negative tests, they made the decision to go to work. But over the holiday weekend, Lark started feeling sick. On Tuesday morning, they tested positive.“The fact that there’s so many cases makes it even more maddening that there’s absolutely no support,” they said. “I’m the ninth or tenth person at my job to test positive in the last couple months, and the best they’ve offered is reminding us of the three paid sick days we get per year.”But three days won’t make up for the extra seven days of lost income.“I don’t really care about the effect of this on my social life; I can spend 10 days at home no problem,” they said, “but I can’t afford to not work.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its isolation guidelines on Dec. 27, recommending a shorter five-day quarantine period for asymptomatic people, and then again on Tuesday with additional recommendations around antigen testing and travel.
 


Soaring cases are also coming at a time when high numbers of non-COVID patients are being admitted to emergency rooms for other reasons, experts say, straining resources. According to the HHS data, about 26% of ICU beds are being used for COVID cases as of Tuesday (of 5,448 national hospitals who report this data to the department). Advertisement     The federal government’s response has been to reiterate the importance of vaccination, the necessity of wearing a mask, and the value of testing and other available methods to stop the spread of the virus.“You can control how big an impact Omicron is going to have on your health,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday in remarks regarding the record number of reported cases. “If you’re unvaccinated, you have some reason to be alarmed.”Biden also announced that FEMA has been ordered to provide additional hospital beds and that his administration will double the number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID treatment pills to 20 million. The first batch of the FDA-approved oral drug was shipped out on Dec. 24.“They’re a game changer,” Biden said about the pill, which takes months to manufacture. “Production is in full swing.”But testing remains a frustration around the country, with long lines, a lack of rapid antigen tests, and few ways for people who test positive at home to report that to authorities. Starting next week, insurance providers will be required to reimburse people for at-home tests. Biden said a government website will launch later this month where people can request free at-home tests.The virus has also posed an issue for schools returning from the holiday break this week. Public school districts in Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have even opted to revert to virtual learning amid the rise in cases, marking a regression to safety measures made early in the pandemic. Advertisement     Although the federal government is pushing hard for schools to remain open, many have struggled with staffing as teachers and administrators become ill themselves. And students who test positive risk falling behind as classes commence.
 


Tiki Duquella is a fully vaccinated student at a private high school in Knoxville, Tennessee. He tested positive for COVID on Tuesday and will have to miss a week of school and cancel a weekend trip to New York to visit friends. While his symptoms are “very minimal,” he said, he was glad a test confirmed they were COVID-related.“I went to get a test because my school started up again and I did not want to get my classmates/faculty sick,” Duquella said. Like so many in the country, he is already struggling to catch up just days into the new year. “It’s the first week, so I feel like it will be pretty difficult to start my second semester a week behind,” he said.Peter Aldhous contributed reporting to this story.

An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads. Advertisement     The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there. Advertisement     Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours. Advertisement     NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.”Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet. Advertisement     Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project.The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that. Advertisement     “It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect.In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

138,Meet SilentSpeller: A smart retainer from one of the creators of Google Glass that could let you text with your tongue.,"


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless).""Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore."" Advertisement  Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year.""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year.""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities.""Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!"" Advertisement  Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly.""
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently. If this pandemic taught us anything, it is that time is precious and limited.""My second personal resolution is to create a personal project every quarter. I need to carve out more space to photograph the things I deeply care about with no pressure from a client or worrying about algorithms. It's the personal projects that help me remember my 'why.'""My last resolution is to continue building and growing the Black Women Photographers organization — for Black women and nonbinary photographers to be seen, celebrated, and hired — all year round. There is still so much work to be done for us to receive proper equity and inclusion in the industry.""Nolwen Cifuentes""My photo resolution for 2022 is to focus on community. Being a freelancer on top of being in a pandemic can get very isolating at times, and I strongly believe people thrive amongst communities. A big goal of mine in 2022 is to foster a photo community both online and in person. I want to host small (and safe!) gatherings with other photographers, photo editors, stylists, makeup artists — all kinds of folks within the photo industry. Ideally more in real life than online because I think real-life gatherings create deeper bonds. Throughout my career, I’ve been so blessed to have exceptional photo mentors or photographer peers I can call for questions or simply to vent, and I want to continue to expand that."" Advertisement  Celeste Sloman""I am really looking forward to working on more longform bodies of work in 2022, and to being more intentional about my photographic practice. I am really excited to experiment with content and technique and push the boundaries of the work I have been doing up until now. The pandemic has made me crave so many of the communal aspects of the creative process, and I am hoping that we will get a better handle on Covid this year so we can all get back together and make things! I do have a list of collaborations and ideas up my sleeve and I am excited to see how they materialize.""Jamie Lee Taete""I’m a pretty anxious and pessimistic person, but I’m going to make an optimistic resolution to try to put some good energy into the universe. My resolution is to take more intimate photos of people and places. I’ve spent the last couple of years photographing people either outside or indoors under extremely limited conditions (and always while having a low-level panic attack, thinking that I might be infecting people with COVID). I want to take the kinds of photos that you can only get by being close to someone for a prolonged period of time. The kinds that are only possible if COVID goes away. (I’m sure I will look back at this resolution and laugh on Jan. 1, 2023, as I’m changing into a full hazmat suit to go out and take photos amid the virus's 100th extra strength mutation.)""

139,Huge decisions will be made in the next few years about who gets water from the shrinking Colorado River. Basin tribes are fighting to get their share.,"


An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads. Advertisement     The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there. Advertisement     Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours. Advertisement     NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.”Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet. Advertisement     Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

“I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that a paternity test has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son,” he continued.“I sincerely apologize to everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately,” he added.
 


“My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you,” Thompson continued. “I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”
 


One quote shared on Instagram on Dec. 31 read: “There’s going to be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change YOU. Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder. But don’t you go and become someone that you're not. Cry. Scream if you have to. Then you straighten out that crown and keep it moving.”Another quote posted weeks prior read: “To the woman who believed that this year would be a year of peace and genuine love, I’m sorry that these days, weeks and months have been so unkind to you. I know it may not feel like it at times but you are magic, you are what happens when a dream decides to go to war with nightmares. You are a symbol of strength and survival.” Advertisement     
 


Weighing in to refute the speculation, Kardashian tweeted, “That’s disappointing my face gave that expression. Halle Berry is such a force. Absolutely Stunning and beyond talented.”“I’m barely in my own body right now,” she continued. ""Please don’t read into anything. Also please don’t tear me apart because you assumed something.""
 


Craig also claimed that Thompson had cheated on her — with Kardashian — while she was pregnant with their son in 2016. Both Thompson and Kardashian have since denied the allegation, and instead maintained that the NBA player was single at the time.
 


“Instead of focusing on any negativity, I am choosing to embrace being a mother and doing the best I can for my son,” Nichols told People. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with [Thompson].”“My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment,” she said.

142,One of the creators of Google Glass has been experimenting with a high-tech dental retainer that works as a communications tool by tracking the movement of your tongue.,"Andy Cohen has spoken out after his “stupid and drunk” New Year’s Eve rant on live TV. Andy attracted a lot of attention over the weekend after several comments he made live on CNN while hosting their annual New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. During the live broadcast on Friday night, Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila. As the night wore on and the alcohol seemingly took effect, Andy went on to throw shade at a string of public figures, including the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. However — after admitting in an Instagram post the next morning that he was “a hair over-served” — Andy later confessed that his only regret from the drunken tirade was calling out Ryan Seacrest. In case you missed it, at one point during the show, Andy made a dig at ABC’s competing NYE show, hosted by Ryan — Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve — which was being broadcast simultaneously from elsewhere in Times Square. “There's a bunch of smoke coming from Ryan Seacrest's group of losers that are performing behind us,” Andy told CNN viewers. “If you've been watching ABC tonight, you've seen nothing, I'm sorry,” he added. Recalling the dig on his SiriusXM show three days later, the Bravo mogul admitted that he felt bad about criticizing the ABC broadcast, and by extension, its host. “The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing, is that I slammed the ABC broadcast,” Andy said on Monday. “I really like Ryan Seacrest and he's a great guy and I really regret saying that and I was just stupid and drunk and feeling it.” “I was continuing the Journey rant and I just kept talking and I shouldn't have and I felt bad about that, so that is the only thing,” he added. The host went on to admit that he wasn’t happy about how his comments about Ryan had been taken out of context by the media. “That’s the problem,” he said of the coverage. “The headlines about Ryan Seacrest are all like I trashed Ryan Seacrest and I really … I hope he hears the clip.” And while plenty of viewers were completely loving Andy’s drunken jabs on NYE, others weren’t so taken with the performance, which went on to spark reports that Andy had been fired by CNN as a result. However, it seems that all's well that ends well, as CNN appears to be standing by its host in spite of the backlash. In a new statement provided to BuzzFeed News today, CNN proceeded to shut down reports that Andy had been fired by the network. ""I can confirm that Andy Cohen will be back to co-host NYE on CNN next year,"" a CNN spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. And with that, we're already looking forward to this year's edition!"

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who sought to revolutionize healthcare with a device she claimed could make medical diagnoses using just a fingerprick of blood, has been found guilty of engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors by making misleading and false statements about the technology’s capabilities.The jury reached the verdict on Monday after deliberating for more than 50 hours over seven days following a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including former employees, investors, doctors, and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services. Advertisement     Jurors needed to determine that Holmes intentionally defrauded investors and doctors and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services in order to convict. The jury decided that Holmes conspired to defraud and defrauded investors, finding her guilty of four counts. She was found not guilty on four charges of conspiring to defraud and defrauding paying patients. The jury could not reach a verdict on three charges.“The jurors in this 15-week trial navigated a complex case amid a pandemic and scheduling obstacles,” US Attorney Stephanie Hinds said in a statement. “I thank the jurors for their thoughtful and determined service that ensured verdicts could be reached. The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes’ culpability in this large scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes.”Now it will be up to a judge to determine her sentence at a later date. Each guilty count carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, plus a fine of $250,000. Holmes could also be ordered to pay restitution. One of the investment firms she was convicted of defrauding belongs to the DeVos family.Holmes didn't immediately react to the verdict as it was read, according to reporters in the courthouse.Holmes will likely receive a sentence that’s much shorter than what the law allows because she is a mother with a young child and does not have a criminal history, Diane Birnholz, a former federal prosecutor and lecturer in law at the UCLA School of Law, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     A Stanford University dropout who was once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, Holmes, 37, captivated investors — and the public — with her vision to make critical lab tests more accessible so that, as she famously repeated in interviews and appearances, “less people have to say goodbye too soon to people they love.”The device that Theranos developed was supposedly faster, cheaper, and more accurate than all other lab equipment on the market and capable of running hundreds of tests on just a few drops of blood. But as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in 2015, in reality, the machine, which was much smaller than other blood analyzers, could run only a small number of the tests, and its results were rife with inaccuracies. Instead, Theranos relied on commercially available machines to run most of its tests, diluting the drops of blood to increase volume for some tests and using much larger samples drawn from patients’ arms for others.The company eventually dissolved in 2018 after the Department of Justice indicted Holmes and her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer, on two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud each. Balwani is set to face a separate trial this year.The case had drawn fascination among people who watched the very public rise and fall of Holmes, whose deep voice, unflinching stare, and uniform of black turtlenecks and red lipstick were captured in a variety of promotional materials and interviews, as well as in documentaries and podcasts. A scripted series featuring actor Amanda Seyfried is in the works, as is a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence. At the core of many of these projects are similar questions: How far should a Silicon Valley startup go as it seeks to disrupt an industry? How could so many wealthy, powerful people buy into a failing business? And was Holmes a delusional dreamer or simply a person running a scam? Advertisement     
 


“Whether or not there are guilty or not guilty verdicts in this case, hopefully the federal indictment and trial have already sent a message to other executives and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be careful not to make material misrepresentations to potential investors and customers,” Birnholz said. “What matters is what’s true at the time you say something, not what you hope to be true in the future.”During the trial, prosecutors used emails, text messages, documents, audio recordings, and video clips of Holmes speaking in interviews, along with testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, to argue that she was clearly aware of problems with the company’s technology and still lied about its capabilities to get money. Prosecutors also told jurors Holmes lied about the company’s work with the military and pharmaceutical giants to entice potential investors and business partners to finance its operations. Advertisement     “The real version of Theranos, where the defendant went to work every day, was dramatically different than the rosy picture that she was painting for others,” Assistant US Attorney John Bostic told jurors. “The disease that plagued Theranos wasn’t a lack of effort. It was a lack of honesty.”During their deliberations, jurors asked to relisten to a key piece of evidence for prosecutors: the recording of a call Holmes had with investigators in 2013 in which she talked about the capabilities of the company’s technology, its work with pharmaceutical companies, the military, and retail partners, like Walgreens. During the call, which was secretly recorded by one of the investors Holmes was accused of defrauding, the former CEO said Theranos was focused on “work in the Middle East and specifically Afghanistan,” as she talked about “the potential to change survival rates” overseas by putting the company’s testing devices on military helicopters.“Military is a big deal for us,” Holmes told investors during the call. “We’ve been doing a lot of work there. We’ve also been doing a lot of work for Special Operations Command in the context of missions in remote areas.”Several investors testified that they came away from this call with the understanding that the military was actively using Theranos devices. But the company’s equipment was never deployed in medical helicopters or on the battlefield, Holmes confirmed in her own testimony, even as she disputed that she had ever told anyone that. Advertisement     During closing arguments, Holmes’ attorney Kevin Downey focused on Holmes' use of the word “potential” while discussing the company’s military work in this call and in other conversations, telling jurors, “She never says Theranos devices are currently being used.”Why then, Bostic asked jurors to consider, did investors, board members, and journalists leave those conversations with the understanding that she was talking about Theranos’s present-day capabilities?Throughout the trial, Holmes’ legal team portrayed the former CEO as a businessperson who worked diligently for years to make lab testing cheaper and more accessible. And despite admitting that she had made several mistakes along the way — and ultimately failed to disrupt healthcare as she set out to do — Holmes testified that she believed her company’s technology worked.“She believed in this technology, she stayed the whole time, and she went down with that ship when it went down,” Downey said during closing arguments.Over the course of seven days, Holmes, whose downfall attracted intense media coverage and public scrutiny, denied that she’d ever tried to mislead anyone, expressed regrets, deflected blame for the company’s problems, and said that Balwani had psychologically and sexually abused her during their decadelong relationship — claims that he denies.But prosecutors told jurors that the issue of whether she was truly a victim of abuse was separate from her actions as CEO.

144,This penguin couple went on a date in their empty aquarium ,"


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless).""Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore."" Advertisement  Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year.""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year.""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities.""Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!"" Advertisement  Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly.""
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently. If this pandemic taught us anything, it is that time is precious and limited.""My second personal resolution is to create a personal project every quarter. I need to carve out more space to photograph the things I deeply care about with no pressure from a client or worrying about algorithms. It's the personal projects that help me remember my 'why.'""My last resolution is to continue building and growing the Black Women Photographers organization — for Black women and nonbinary photographers to be seen, celebrated, and hired — all year round. There is still so much work to be done for us to receive proper equity and inclusion in the industry.""Nolwen Cifuentes""My photo resolution for 2022 is to focus on community. Being a freelancer on top of being in a pandemic can get very isolating at times, and I strongly believe people thrive amongst communities. A big goal of mine in 2022 is to foster a photo community both online and in person. I want to host small (and safe!) gatherings with other photographers, photo editors, stylists, makeup artists — all kinds of folks within the photo industry. Ideally more in real life than online because I think real-life gatherings create deeper bonds. Throughout my career, I’ve been so blessed to have exceptional photo mentors or photographer peers I can call for questions or simply to vent, and I want to continue to expand that."" Advertisement  Celeste Sloman""I am really looking forward to working on more longform bodies of work in 2022, and to being more intentional about my photographic practice. I am really excited to experiment with content and technique and push the boundaries of the work I have been doing up until now. The pandemic has made me crave so many of the communal aspects of the creative process, and I am hoping that we will get a better handle on Covid this year so we can all get back together and make things! I do have a list of collaborations and ideas up my sleeve and I am excited to see how they materialize.""Jamie Lee Taete""I’m a pretty anxious and pessimistic person, but I’m going to make an optimistic resolution to try to put some good energy into the universe. My resolution is to take more intimate photos of people and places. I’ve spent the last couple of years photographing people either outside or indoors under extremely limited conditions (and always while having a low-level panic attack, thinking that I might be infecting people with COVID). I want to take the kinds of photos that you can only get by being close to someone for a prolonged period of time. The kinds that are only possible if COVID goes away. (I’m sure I will look back at this resolution and laugh on Jan. 1, 2023, as I’m changing into a full hazmat suit to go out and take photos amid the virus's 100th extra strength mutation.)""

At least two people are still missing, presumed dead, and almost 1,000 homes and other structures were destroyed after a fast-moving wildfire swept through suburban areas northwest of Denver, Colorado officials said Sunday.The blazes sparked on Thursday destroyed some 991 structures and damaged 127 others in the town of Superior and city of Louisville, as well as unincorporated Boulder County. Advertisement     Entire neighborhoods were burned to the ground, with federal officials touring the area Sunday to see the damage for themselves, including scores of burned-out vehicles, some abandoned in the middle of the road by people fleeing. “The pictures that I was seeing on the television before today don’t even come close to what you see when you look at it in person — the amount of devastation,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters at a press briefing.The fires burned more than 6,000 acres, whipped by wind gusts of over 105 mph that propelled them through abnormally dry conditions in the area.But in surreal scenes that reflected the wild environmental conditions, 8 inches of snow began falling in the area Friday, ultimately helping to extinguish the blazes.“The snow is an awesome thing for fire behavior,” Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Saturday, “and it’s a hard thing for crime scene and recovery efforts and damage assessments and all those things. So it’s a mixed blessing.” Advertisement     “In a few places, there’s still smoldering debris and smoke partially covered by snow,” Gov. Jared Polis said Sunday. “It’s really an odd and disturbing juxtaposition.”There had been no fatalities reported in the immediate aftermath of the fires, but officials now say at least two people whose homes were destroyed are missing. A third person who had been missing Saturday has since been accounted for.“We’re very fortunate that we don’t have a list of 100 people missing,” Pelle said.Officials were set to use cadaver dogs to try to locate the individuals’ bodies, but the conditions were still extremely dangerous for recovery workers.“The debris is hot, it’s all fallen in, and it’s now covered with 8 inches of snow, so search and recovery efforts are hampered substantially,” Pelle said.
 


Local officials originally suspected downed power lines had sparked the blazes, but that, too, has changed, according to Pelle.Investigators have not found any credible evidence of any such downed lines. Instead, they have mounted what Pelle described as a “very active investigation” into other possible causes. Advertisement     Acting on a tip, authorities executed a search warrant on one property, but the sheriff declined at this stage to identify it.However, he did say that a viral video of what appeared to be a barn on fire was part of the investigation.Jennifer Balch, a fire scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told the Denver Post the fires were exacerbated by a climate change–related dry spell that had turned grassland into highly flammable kindling.“Climate change is definitely a part of this story in that fire seasons are longer,” Balch said. “We don’t have a season any longer. We are now looking at yearlong fires.""Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious circle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels.Local, state, and federal officials are on the ground in Colorado to assist people in finding housing and dealing with insurance companies, but Polis said many residents are still in shock.“For many, it seems like a surreal experience,” he said. “Just a few days ago, you were celebrating Christmas at home and hanging your stockings, and now home and hearth have been destroyed, and it’s a shock. The reality, I know, hasn’t even set in for so many folks who’ve lost everything.”

146,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


US health officials may again revise guidelines that recently shortened the isolation period for asymptomatic people with COVID-19 to recommend that they test negative for the virus, the White House’s top medical adviser said Sunday.The guidance released by the CDC last week halved the number of days that people infected with the coronavirus who are not exhibiting symptoms need to isolate themselves from 10 to five, followed by five days of wearing a “well-fitting” mask in public. Advertisement     But scientists told BuzzFeed News they were surprised and alarmed there was no recommendation that people produce a negative test prior to reentering public life. Some speculated it was because many Americans were struggling to obtain rapid antigen tests.“There has been some concern about why we don’t ask people at that five-day period to get tested. That is something that is now under consideration,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said in an interview Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “The CDC is very well aware that there has been some pushback about that.”He added, “Looking at it again, there may be an option in that — that testing could be a part of that — and I think we’re going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.”
 


Fauci’s comments suggest something of a reversal for the CDC and the White House, which had previously defended the lack of a testing requirement.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week that the organization did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious.“On the other hand, we know that after five days, people are much less likely to transmit the virus, and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said.Officials said that with hundreds of thousands of Americans testing positive each day as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps the US, the shorter isolation period for asymptomatic individuals was necessary to keep the country running.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” Fauci told CNN last week. “But if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs, to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”
 


In his interview Sunday, Fauci said there was accumulating evidence that the Omicron variant leads to less serious infection and illness, especially in vaccinated individuals, but officials are still concerned that hospitals may be overwhelmed.Because of Omicron’s infectiousness, record numbers of Americans are testing positive. But Fauci said the US should shift its primary focus away from case numbers to hospitalizations.“I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all, because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Fauci said.

Twitter permanently blocked the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday for her repeated violations of the website’s policies on COVID-19 misinformation.“We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     The suspension was prompted by a tweet Greene authored on New Year’s Day in which she called COVID vaccines “dangerous” and falsely said that “extremely high amounts of covid vaccine deaths are ignored.”It was her fifth such violation of the misinformation policy. Under Twitter’s rules, her previous violations caused her to lose access to the account for between 12 hours and seven days.Her previous false tweets said, among other things, that the vaccines were “failing” and that COVID was dangerous only to people who are obese or over 65.Greene’s account had more than 465,000 followers at the time of its suspension.The Georgia Republican is not technically banned from Twitter, since she will still have access to the account for her congressional office, @RepMTG.But that account, which has more than 387,000 followers, could be banned if Greene uses it to violate Twitter’s rules.It is customary for US lawmakers to maintain separate accounts on social media because they are prohibited from fundraising and other campaign activities on their official government channels. Advertisement     In a defiant message posted on Telegram after her suspension, Greene said, ""Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth.""Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.Former president Donald Trump was banned from the platform almost a year ago following the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”Greene, who has supported Qanon and trafficked in nonsensical and racist conspiracies, has been one of the loudest voices in her party spreading misinformation during the pandemic.But she is not alone among the GOP.On Friday, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee deleted a tweet from their official account that falsely said booster shots don’t work.According to scientists and medical authorities, COVID vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious illness, even against more contagious variants, such as Omicron and Delta.The vaccines have been rigorously tested and are now under the most intense safety monitoring in US history, according to the CDC.More than 4.5 billion people around the world have received a dose.

Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

149,“You brought an editing mistake of a mislabeled photograph to our attention.”,"


A private intelligence business owned by a lead FBI agent in the Michigan kidnapping case may have tainted the “good faith and integrity of the investigation,” defense attorneys are arguing in a new court filing.The agent, Jayson Chambers, was the primary handler for a confidential informant who infiltrated the armed militant group Wolverine Watchmen and who played a central role in building the case that they allegedly plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In August, BuzzFeed News revealed that Chambers had registered a business called Exeintel that was linked to an internet troll who appeared to have tweeted about the case before it became public. Advertisement     
 


Earlier this month, prosecutors said that the government would not be calling on Chambers to testify at the federal trial in the case, slated to begin March 8, and that discussion of the agent’s “extrinsic” business should not be permitted — even if defense attorneys call him as a witness. But in their Friday filing, attorneys for all five federal defendants facing trial claim that Exeintel is relevant because it represents an “apparent conflict of interest” and they should be permitted to explore the topic at trial.In materials circulated in 2019 to promote Exeintel, Chambers cited his casework with the FBI, which the defense lawyers said proves he “was attempting to leverage his success in criminal investigations performed for the FBI for his personal profit.” By extension, they claim, it’s possible that Chambers had financial motivation for the kidnapping investigation to result in arrests — and that could explain behavior by the agent they characterize as an attempt to entrap their clients.The government charged six men with conspiring to kidnap the sitting governor in October 2020. One subsequently pleaded guilty, while five others — Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft, Adam Fox, Kaleb Franks, and Daniel Harris — maintain their innocence and claim the government “initiated” and directed the entire conspiracy. Last week, they asked for the indictment to be dismissed because of “egregious overreaching” by the government, which employed at least a dozen confidential informants during the probe.Federal prosecutors have denied those allegations, claiming the men were predisposed to commit the crimes. The Michigan attorney general's office has similarly defended its case against eight additional men who were charged with providing material support to terrorism.To underscore their theory of predisposition, prosecutors are seeking to admit evidence of prior criminal activity by several of the defendants, including two convictions by Croft in the 1990s and one by Franks in 2013. In new filings, defense attorneys say the government “mischaracterizes” the offenses to make them appear more serious, but in fact they bear “no resemblance to the charged offense” and thus have “no value with regard to showing propensity.” An attorney for Croft also noted that he was fully pardoned by the governor of Delaware for both of those convictions in 2018.A spokesperson for the FBI referred a request for comment to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously declined to discuss the kidnapping case. Jayson Chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A particular challenge for prosecutors in what is arguably the highest-profile domestic terrorism case in the country — other than those related to the Capitol insurrection — has been the conduct of the FBI agents in the probe.One agent, Richard Trask, who was held out as the public face of the case, was fired after being charged with beating his wife in July. A second agent, Henrik Impola, has been accused of perjury in a different case, and in a filing Friday, defense attorneys asked the court’s permission to question him on the stand about that allegation, which prosecutors have termed “unfounded.”According to evidence shared by the government and cited by defense lawyers in their filing, Chambers may have played a far more important role in the case than the other two. Records show he wrote 227 reports on contacts with the confidential informant known as “Dan,” compared with just five written by Impola and zero by Trask.Dan, court testimony shows, helped initiate the case in March 2020 and made hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings of the defendants, accompanying them on trips to meetings and training exercises and often paying for their travel expenses. A text message sent by Chambers to Dan in September 2020 stated, “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”The FBI has declined to state whether Chambers sought permission from the bureau to register a business while still working full time as an agent. Prosecutors have said that he never made any money from Exeintel and that he abandoned plans to quit the FBI. But public records show that Chambers did not formally dissolve his company until Oct. 29 of this year, “meaning he owned the company throughout the entire investigation of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,” defense attorneys wrote Friday.

This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context. Advertisement     On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes). We typically use these to test our colleagues in the newsroom, but we publish them for the readers who are so inclined to take them. Here’s one from July with the theme of TikTok trends, and a supernatural style quiz from October.Finally, don’t miss our favorite year-end traditions: The Best, Worst, and Funniest Corrections and The Best Grammar Memes and Tweets (most of which are from us — what about it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).What's New?Here are some of the additions and changes we made to the style guide in 2021!ableist terms: added alternatives words to use instead of those that have ableist connotations or make light of disabilities (instead of crippled or handicapped, use hampered, obstructed, or inhibited; instead of tone-deaf, use insensitive, obtuse, or oblivious).Afghan (citizens of Afghanistan), afghani (currency)antisemitism (no hyphen)copy desk (replaced copydesk); copy editor (n.)coronavirus pandemic: Capitalize the Greek alphabet name assigned to a variant by the WHO, e.g., the Omicron variant.disinformation: the intentional spreading of false or misleading information, often for political gain (e.g., a disinformation campaign); misinformation refers to falsehoods more generally, without a specific intentfirst gentleman: like first family and first lady, always lowercase as they’re not formal titles, e.g., first lady Jill Biden (first partner, anyone?)older adults or older person/people: Use these rather than senior citizens, seniors, or elderly. Do not use the elderly to refer to a group, as the term is vague and can be dehumanizing. Include age specifics when possible (e.g., “People 65 and over qualify”).

151,"The verdict came after a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Holmes herself.","


This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


Marie Bergum wanted the chance to live her own life — and make her own mistakes. Her father said that could not happen.
 


Marie was in her 30s and had an intellectual disability. As a teenager, she lived a mostly independent life like other teens and took the bus to a job at McDonald’s, where she helped work the cash register. Marie also cooked at home and took care of the dogs.
 


After her parents divorced, her father, Jim, became her legal guardian.
 


Marie did not understand what this meant when she agreed to it, and she later decided she did not want her father to be her legal guardian. (In California, where Marie is from, they call legal guardians ""conservators,"" and guardianships ""conservatorships."") Advertisement     
 


She wanted to learn how to do things like budgeting and making medical decisions instead of her father doing them for her. She said, “I need help with life!” and later said, “But I want them to show me, not do it for me.”
 


Marie worked together with some lawyers and family members who believed she could make her own decisions. She had to be careful that her father did not know about her meetings with them.
 


Sometimes Marie had to be sneaky by calling her supporters from the gym locker room because she felt she had no privacy at home. This was a risk — she said if her dad found out she was on the phone instead of lifting weights, he would call her a liar or follow her the next time she left the house. Marie said if he knew she was trying to fight for freedom to make her own decisions, he might take her phone away from her.
 


Marie’s lawyers told the courts that Jim was controlling her money, not allowing her to have sex with boyfriends, keeping her away from people he didn’t like, verbally abusing her by calling her “stupid” and “fat,” and moving her from city to city without including her in the decision. Marie told court officers that Jim did not allow her to have a lock on her door, take public transportation, cook meals, or choose how much money she could spend each week. “He started saying that I couldn’t do things because I wasn’t that smart,” Marie told BuzzFeed News. “Everything was taken away, a little bit every year.”
 


Jim told BuzzFeed News he loved his daughter, and the world was full of dangers and people looking to take advantage of her. He said, “My job is to protect her and put her on the path that she can succeed as best as she can.” He said his rules stopped her from making mistakes she might later wish she did not make. Jim said that he wanted his daughter to be happy and that being her guardian was the best way to achieve that because she, unfortunately, was not as capable as she thought she was. Jim said many of Marie’s accusations were wrong, but he didn’t take them personally.
 


There are many more stories like Marie’s. People with disabilities often must speak up for “dignity of risk”: the right to make choices freely, good and bad, to learn from and live full lives. Disability rights experts say that everyone, especially young adults, deserves the chance to make mistakes and learn from them. Advertisement     
 


Experts say it can be hard to get freedom from legal guardians who are family members. Many parents of children with disabilities get guardianship as soon as the child turns 18 because schools tell them they should. This is called the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Even if parents want to end the guardianship later, it can be hard to do so.
 


There are other options for people with disabilities to get support that do not take away their rights to make decisions. Supported decision-making allows people to choose who will help them make decisions instead of having another person take over the person’s life and make choices for them. Advertisement     
 


Disability rights experts say that supported decision-making can work for many people with disabilities. Researchers learned that when people with disabilities make their own decisions, they are more likely to have jobs and be healthier, happier, and more involved in their communities. Even the National Guardianship Association said supported decision-making is a “promising” measure that “should be considered for the person before guardianship.”
 


Marie filed to end her guardianship in March 2018. She wrote, “My human rights are being violated.” Her father disagreed and told the court, “I hate to say this, but it is a proven truth, that I must not only save Marie from outside predators just waiting for an opportunity, but Marie often requires being saved from herself and her own lack of ability to decide what is healthy and safe for her.” The judge allowed Jim to continue having control over Marie’s life. Advertisement     
 


Soon after, Marie got new lawyers so she could try again to gain her freedom. She created a supported decision-making plan and assigned family members to support her in different parts of her life, such as budgeting, housing, completing job applications, making medical decisions, cooking, making educational plans, and staying safe. This time she won, and the court removed Jim as her guardian.
 


Marie’s Aunt Nancy, together with a program manager from an advocacy center, will be her guardians for one year. Then a judge will decide if Marie can successfully live without a guardian. The court said Jim can never again be Marie’s guardian. “Jim can’t do anything to me anymore,” she said with a wide grin. Advertisement     
 


“Be persistent. Your dreams can come true. Don’t let anyone in your family tell you you can’t do things.”

Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●
 



"
154,Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.,"


Betty White, the beloved television icon whose career spanned eight decades, died Dec. 31 just weeks before she was to turn 100.Her agent, Jeff Witjas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a statement to People, he confirmed her death.""Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,"" Witjas said. ""I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don't think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again."" Advertisement     Los Angeles authorities confirmed that officers responded to her address for what was believed to be a ""natural cause of death,"" but did not provide further details. Fire officials said they responded to a ""medical aid request"" and confirmed the death of a 99-year-old woman.White was best known for her role as naive St. Olaf, Minnesota, native Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, which ran from 1985 to 1992 and earned White an Emmy Award and six nominations. Earlier this week, White told People that she felt ""so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age.""
 


While her part on the endlessly rerun series may have gotten her the most name recognition, White's career began long before The Golden Girls and went on for decades after.Her first TV appearance was in 1939, a few months after her high school graduation. She began working in radio in the 1940s before getting her first regular TV gig on the variety show Hollywood on Television in 1949. In 1951, she was nominated for an Emmy in the Best Actress on Television category, the very first time the award was given (it went to Gertrude Berg). Advertisement     
 


White worked steadily through the ’60s and ’70s, with memorable appearances on game shows like What's My Line?, Match Game, and Password. She married Password host Allen Ludden in 1963, and they remained together until his death in 1981. (""I had the love of my life,"" White told Anderson Cooper in 2011. ""If you've had the best, who needs the rest?"")In 1973, White began her stint as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She proved adept at capturing the contrast between Nivens' sweet on-air persona as ""the Happy Homemaker"" and her sarcastic, sexually voracious real-life demeanor. She won two Emmys for her performance.After The Mary Tyler Moore Show ended in 1977, White continued to take on guest and recurring TV roles. In 1983, she became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host (for the NBC series Just Men!). Two years later, she landed her career-defining part on The Golden Girls. White was originally considered for the role of Blanche, but director Jay Sandrich believed she should do something different after playing man-hungry so memorably on Mary Tyler Moore.
 


For the rest of her career, White would continue to take on roles where she played up the surprising dirty side behind her sweet exterior.While she continued acting after the cancellation of The Golden Girls in 1992 — and its ill-fated spinoff, The Golden Palace, in 1993 — her major resurgence didn't begin until the late 2000s, thanks to her role in the 2009 romantic comedy The Proposal and a 2010 grassroots campaign that propelled White into hosting Saturday Night Live. At age 88, she became the oldest person to host the show. That same year, White joined the cast of TV Land's Hot in Cleveland. Her character, Elka Ostrovsky, was written just for the pilot, but White's performance had her upgraded to a regular for all six seasons of the series.
 


Outside of acting, White was a devoted animal rights advocate, working for decades with organizations such as the Morris Animal Foundation and the Los Angeles Zoo Commission. She was awarded the American Veterinary Medical Association's Humane Award in 1987.Beyond her charity work, White was a symbol of making the most out of one's later years: She enjoyed the most popularity and acclaim at an age when most people are long retired. When she was awarded the Guinness World Record for longest TV career for a female entertainer, White said, ""I have no regrets at all. None. I consider myself to be the luckiest old broad on two feet.""News of White's death sparked an outpouring of grief and remembrances on social media. Former SNL cast member Seth Meyers said the Golden Girl was the only celebrity host he saw get a standing ovation at the show's afterparty. ""A party at which she ordered a vodka and a hotdog and stayed til the bitter end,"" Meyers tweeted.Ryan Reynolds, who starred alongside White in The Proposal, said on Instagram, ""The world looks a little different now"" without his grandma Annie.""She was great at defying expectation,"" Reynolds wrote. ""She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty. Now you know the secret.""In a statement, their costar Sandra Bullock said she would do as White did.""I don’t drink vodka … but I will tonight, on ice, with a slice of lemon with a hot dog on the other side and just be okay being sad,"" Bullock said. ""I’ll have to buy some rose-colored glasses because Betty was that for all of us.""
 


Jamie Lee Curtis remembered her You Again costar as ""full of love and creativity and integrity and humor and dedication and a life of service to animals"" in an Instagram post.""What women WANT is to live a life like Betty White,"" Curtis wrote. ""Rest easy you beautiful woman. We will carry on for you!""
 


Kathy Griffin shared a touching tribute in a Twitter thread, talking about the times she spent with White while on set.""She treated me like we were in the same club or something. She actually treated me like an equal in the comedy gurrrl world,"" Griffin wrote. ""She was as sharp and funny as she was soft and wise and no matter how long this world continues to spin, there will be only one Betty White."" Advertisement     
 


Mitchell Hurwitz, a TV writer and producer who worked on The Golden Girls, remembered White for her quick wit.""She was such an incredibly special person, so funny, so warm - and so strong,"" Hurwtiz tweeted. ""And I have a feeling she lied about her age and actually made it to 100.""

[Note: This post — the sixth annual in a series! — is a list, not a ranking, so please don't yell at us if your favorite is #27 or whatever.]1. The Stuck Ship
 


On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.) Advertisement     In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016.5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split.Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.” Advertisement     7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe). Advertisement     Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later. Advertisement     “I’m still floored at how many years have gone by and people are making this a big thing, but I also understand, because I smile every time I think of The Backyardigans,” said Jamia Simone Nash, the singing voice behind Uniqua. “Being a part of everyone’s childhood, that’s been the best part of my career.”10. Kathryn Hahn Winking
 


WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme. Advertisement     12. “No Children” by the Mountain Goats
 


A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats).The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.”15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”). Advertisement     Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself.What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post. Advertisement     20. White Girl Dancing
 


Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy. Advertisement     22. Naur
 


“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast. Advertisement     23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting. Advertisement     The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part. Advertisement     People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used. Advertisement     Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard. Advertisement     People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.”This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023. Advertisement  Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California.But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself. Advertisement  A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later.Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input. Advertisement  The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?”
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water. Advertisement  “If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?”
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was.Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river. Advertisement  “Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.”The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.” Advertisement  While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions.“Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes. Advertisement  
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause. Advertisement  
 


Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

160,It’s that time year again: Here are the BuzzFeed News staff’s “What We Tried and Loved” lists ,"


More than 500 homes were destroyed and tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate after high winds whipped two wildfires in suburban areas near Boulder, Colorado, on Thursday.Both fires were likely started by downed power lines, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said, but officials are continuing to investigate. As of Thursday evening, only one injury had been reported — debris blew into a police officer's eye — but Pelle stressed the human toll could be higher. Advertisement     By Friday morning, however, there were still no reports of fatalities, he said, adding that a person who had been reported missing was accounted for and doing well.""So that's awesome news, and actually, I think given the events that we had yesterday, pretty miraculous,"" Pelle said during a news conference.Kelli Christensen, a spokesperson for UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, told BuzzFeed News the facility received six patients in connection with the fires. Christensen did not provide any information about their condition or injuries, citing privacy laws.The Middle Fork and Marshall fires started Thursday morning and exploded as wind gusts of more than 100 mph hit the region. As of Thursday evening, the Marshall fire had burned through 1,600 acres, prompting evacuations in Superior and Louisville, as well as parts of Broomfield. Videos on social media showed people leaving stores that shut down as smoke loomed. Advertisement     
 


All 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision outside the town of Superior were destroyed, as well as 210 homes in the Old Town neighborhood. A shopping center and hotel also burned, and authorities said the full scope of damage in other neighborhoods remained unknown.""I would estimate it's going to be at least 500 homes,"" Pelle said, but added that he would ""not be surprised if it's 1,000.""The fires burned over an area that includes approximately 2,000 homes, but some neighborhoods were left standing, while others were completely devastated, authorities said.
 


The National Weather Service Boulder extended a high-wind warning until 8 p.m. Thursday for locations at the base of the foothills, but winds weakened in the area of the fires overnight. Advertisement     ""We were fortunate that the winds dissipated last night,"" Pelle said.As snow began to fall over the Boulder area Friday morning, authorities said that as long as the weather holds up there shouldn't be much additional damage from the fires.
 


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Friday and that the state has been approved for federal assistance. Still, he recognized that many things lost could not be replaced.“There’s no way to quantify in any financial way the price of a loss, the price of losing the chair that was handed down to you from your grandmother, of losing your childhood yearbooks, of losing your photos, of losing your computer files, which hundred of Colorado families have experienced today with no warning,"" Polis said.Footage from a Denver7 News reporter showed homes continued to burn Thursday night.
 


Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious cycle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels.According to the NWS Boulder, the second half of this year was one the driest on record for the Denver area.""Denver received well above normal precipitation from February through June. But since then, precipitation has flat-lined,"" the station tweeted.
 


Polis also acknowledged how unusual the timing was for a wildfire.“Here in December, who thought we would be fighting a major grassland fire?” he said.On Friday, after viewing the damage from above, Polis again spoke to the shock of watching the disaster materialize so rapidly at a time when the state and the country are grappling with yet another surge in the coronavirus. Advertisement     ""You know it feels like we’ve experienced enough tragedy and loss these last two years and then yesterday happened over the course of several hours,"" he said. ""This is our community and to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly is something that I think we’re all just struggling to believe and understand.""

161,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


The BBC has come under fire for airing a segment about the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict that featured commentary from a man who allegedly sexually assaulted one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, while failing to disclose that fact to viewers.In a statement Thursday, the network said that the appearance of lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who also had represented Epstein, did not meet its editorial standards.""Mr. Dershowitz was not a suitable person to interview as an impartial analysis and we did not make the relevant background clear to our audience. We will look into how this happened,"" the statement reads. Advertisement     In 2015, Virginia Giuffre said in a federal lawsuit that Epstein kept her as a sex slave and forced her to have sex with Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. Both men have strongly denied the allegations.Giuffre was not called to testify in Maxwell's trial, though she was mentioned hundreds of times in court proceedings. She is currently suing Andrew in New York federal court for sexual abuse.After Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking charges on Wednesday, Dershowitz appeared on BBC World News, where he was introduced simply as a ""constitutional lawyer,"" to discuss Maxwell's conviction.
 


Dershowitz criticized Giuffre during the segment, saying that the prosecutors' choice not to involve her in their case against Maxwell discredited her accusations against him and Epstein.""The government did not use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, who accused me, accused many other people because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth,"" Dershowitz said.He also addressed the ongoing proceedings between Giuffre and Andrew. He said Maxwell's conviction ""weakens the case against Prince Andrew considerably because the government was very selective in who it used.""The network immediately came under fire for the segment.
 


Dershowitz issued a statement on Twitter on Thursday morning after the backlash against his interview with the BBC.""Following the Maxwell conviction, BBC requested an interview, during which I explicitly stated that I , Prince Andrew and other people had been accused of having sex with Virginia Guffre,"" he said. Advertisement     ""I commented on the prosecution’s wise decision not to use her as a witness because of her lack of credibility. The media has repeatedly interviewed victims of Epstein’s abuse,"" Dershowitz said in another tweet. He added that it was ""appropriate"" for the network to interview him and suggested that those accused of sexual assault by Giuffre were the ""victims.""

162,"Betty White died at the age of 99. While most known for her role on The Golden Girls, her career went on for decades after.","


Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

163,Betty White has died just before her 100th birthday. The beloved icon's extraordinary career spanned over 80 years. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/.../betty-white-obituary...,"


[Note: This post — the sixth annual in a series! — is a list, not a ranking, so please don't yell at us if your favorite is #27 or whatever.]1. The Stuck Ship
 


On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.) Advertisement     In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016.5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split.Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.” Advertisement     7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe). Advertisement     Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later. Advertisement     “I’m still floored at how many years have gone by and people are making this a big thing, but I also understand, because I smile every time I think of The Backyardigans,” said Jamia Simone Nash, the singing voice behind Uniqua. “Being a part of everyone’s childhood, that’s been the best part of my career.”10. Kathryn Hahn Winking
 


WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme. Advertisement     12. “No Children” by the Mountain Goats
 


A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats).The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.”15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”). Advertisement     Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself.What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post.

Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy.

“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast. Advertisement     23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting. Advertisement     The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part. Advertisement     People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used. Advertisement     Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard. Advertisement     People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

2021 was a mix of ups and downs: leaving the house and then staying inside again, vaccines and variants. The year took a lot from us, as the pandemic continued and the number of people who died from COVID in the US alone surpassed 800,000 in December. Among those who have died in the past 12 months were some well-known figures, including Virgil Abloh and Michael K. Williams.Here's a look back at just a few of those in the public eye who died this year.

This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


BuzzFeed News did an investigation into guardianships. The reporters learned that guardianships have hurt many people with disabilities. Here are eight important facts that were found during the investigation.
 


1. America’s guardianship system is supposed to help protect people with disabilities who are unable to make decisions for themselves. However, more than 1 million adults are now under guardianship and are at risk of abuse, theft, and even death. Advertisement     
 


2. People under guardianship can permanently lose their right to vote, marry, start a family, decide where to live, agree to medical treatment, spend their money, look for jobs, or own property. They can also lose the right to hire a lawyer to fight for them, which means that once a guardianship is in place, it is often impossible to find freedom again.
 


3. Sometimes guardians are family members, but they can also be professionals with hundreds of people under their control.
 


4. The guardianship system is not always fair to people with disabilities. The guardians, lawyers, and experts may be paid with money belonging to the person with disabilities, even if that person doesn’t want a legal guardian. Also, the judges and lawyers often know each other and may not make fair decisions about the person with disabilities.
 


5. Guardians who follow the rules can be very helpful for people with disabilities. But some people under guardianship have been abused, neglected, and killed. Others have been locked up and kept away from their families and friends.
 


6. Some guardians take all the money from people’s bank accounts. Last year a guardian was charged with abuse and neglect of a person under her protection. Another person under guardianship was abused by his home care staff and died, and his guardian did not realize he was missing for several months after it happened. Advertisement     
 


7. There are no laws in the U.S. about guardianship, and there is no way to know exactly how many people are affected by it. BuzzFeed News believes that there could be 200,000 new guardianship cases in our country every year.
 


8. Judges are not supposed to put someone under guardianship without first thinking about other options, but sometimes that doesn’t happen. Young people with disabilities are often put under guardianship after graduating from school. The National Council on Disability calls this the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Sometimes parents do not understand how bad guardianship can be until it is too late to change it.

The month before your 30th birthday has been an unrelenting onslaught of bad news. You try to keep your chin up because you love your birthday — you’re an Aquarius, but also a narcissist above all, so this should be your time. Instead, you feel like you’re pressing your forehead against very cold glass, waiting for it to shatter and cut you up into a million little pieces.You’re into your second year of quarantine thanks to a pandemic that you once dismissed as “just a bad flu.” Every day you take your stupid little depression walk with your stupid little mask, and you think about your stupid little brain and how, for a fleeting moment, it convinced you that this would be nothing. You haven’t seen your family or most of your friends since early 2020; you, a genius, opted to move to New York from Toronto a year before the pandemic hit, and now you feel trapped in a place that looks like home but feels completely foreign. When you google grocery stores (you don’t recognize any of the chains) to try to find bucatini, you just find a bodega that sells nothing but 6-year-old lime chips. Your niece calls you and tells you she’s been watching news clips of you online because she misses seeing your face and hearing your voice. You have never been punched in the nose with a closed fist (surprising, since you’ve often deserved it), but this is probably what it feels like. Advertisement  Every weekend, you sit in a transparent bubble built out of plastic and zippers, encircling a little patio table and chair and heater. Your ankles are on fire, your head is freezing cold. You’re too chilly — in every meaning of the word — to ever really enjoy the pleasure of getting drunk. You bring a Corpse Reviver No. 2 to your lips, shivering, and think, Yes, this is fine.Three weeks before your birthday, your Veena Masi dies in India, a country that once told you that you belonged there and then denied you a visa for entry, right before the pandemic hit. People tell you that the canceled trip was good news — “Imagine being stuck in India for all this!” It’s cold comfort — you’re sure you were denied because of an article you wrote a year earlier, critical of the Indian government and its handling of Kashmir, but you can’t even get any confirmation of this. Your aunt was a small, spry woman who spoke very little English but always held your hands in hers and told you that you look like your mother. She was a year younger than your mom, who calls you from Canada wailing into the phone. Her family is shrinking. She didn’t see this one coming. You want to run to her and make her chai and help manage your father, but you can’t, because there’s a pandemic, and accidentally killing your mother seems worse than just letting her suffer in front of you on FaceTime. “My childhood is gone,” she says. You’re quiet, and you listen, distinctly aware that your mother’s unbearable grief is but a reminder that your childhood, too, is slipping away.Your niece’s dog, Steven “Steve” Roger Koul, a miniature dachshund your brother got when you were in the 11th grade, is starting to slow down. He isn’t eating, he seems disoriented, and his face is mostly gray. Most of his teeth have been pulled, so now he peers around the room with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. It’s cute, but still a harbinger of doom. He’s an old man, but you’re hoping he can get through the year. You think about how you once took care of him for three weeks, and he kept leaping up on the kitchen counter to eat your lunches, day after day. You cry, because now he can’t really eat any sandwiches at all.Despite opening your laptop every day for 10 to 13 hours, you have made less than no progress on your book. You sold it a year before the pandemic compressed your life, a collection of essays about...what was it again? Fighting? Fights? Being an asshole? All three, maybe. But you have lost any sense of who you are, and such a thing makes writing about yourself impossible. When you read the thoughts of your own narrator, you think to yourself, God, I hate this woman. You wonder if you should give the money back to your publisher, or perhaps try to say something so inflammatory that they just cancel it themselves. (Written in your notebook during a brainstorm: “Do a murder? Be racist against an invented ethnic group? Try to get on Red Scare?”) Advertisement  You get a haircut because you want to feel better. It comes out looking like Steve chewed on your hair and left you with jagged ends. You call your friend Barb, who looks at you with her saddest eyes because she knows it’s beyond repair — that’s how you really know things are falling apart. You cry for three days while your husband, typically bold and confident, stands awkwardly at your bedroom door, looking at you, stricken. “But I like bangs,” he says, mostly to himself.
 


Steve has to be put down two weeks after Veena Masi’s death. Your niece is handling it better than any of the adults; she calls wearing a tiger onesie and plies you with platitudes. “He was old, Boo,” she says. “It was his time.” (She is still little enough to call you Boo — will that eventually change too?) She asks if you can still play video games together, a small reassurance that she’s malleable enough to not be forever embittered by this random, cruel moment in her life. Does everything really need to be taken away from this little girl, all at the same time? She’s in remote learning again, like children everywhere, and she hates it. She can’t even hug her grandparents, something she understands, but they somehow do not, despite being 60 years older than her. “Just one hug,” your dad tells her when she visits, outside, masked, many feet apart. “I’ll put a blanket on you and then hug you.” Advertisement  Your niece becomes incensed by your father’s disregard for the rules. “Don’t you get it?” she screams at him, her pink little face becoming red. “I could kill you!”Your mom’s older sister gets COVID, so she calls to talk about that, instead of the knee replacement she desperately needs. She texts you the crying-laughing emoji instead of the crying emoji, which for once, you can’t bring yourself to find very funny.What is a little funny is that turning 30 marks the end of other people thinking you’re exceptional. When you’re young and competent, people treat you like you’re some kind of wunderkind. It’s impressive that you can do your job, that you’re climbing out of debt, that you’re forming healthy relationships. But by the time you’re 30, you’re just doing what’s expected of you. It’s mundane, your semi-tidy apartment, your shelfful of books that visitors expect you to have actually read. That seems unfair. You realize that the next few years will be spent accepting that you’re no longer young enough to be considered interesting or compelling, and not old enough to have institutional power or an advanced sense of self-confidence. No one praises you for owning an iron anymore. Who will care about your average book at your average age?Your bangs continue to grow out, by which you mean horizontally. You look like a My Chemical Romance fan club president. You would like to die, but instead, you have to be grateful to not have the coronavirus, to have most of your family intact, to be healthy, to be alive. It’s a stupid fucking list — what kind of life is it to just have to be thankful for not losing it all the time? You grind your teeth so hard that the back of your front tooth chips. Instead of getting it fixed, you spend days rubbing your tongue against it until it bleeds. Advertisement  You post a photo of your bad haircut on Instagram in an attempt to make fun of yourself, the only way you know how to cope with a mild irritant. You end up hurting your own feelings when a stranger messages you, “I love mullets on brown women!” You delete the photo and write “FUCK” in a journal for seven pages.
 


So wrapped up in your own grief about the pandemic — and the idea of turning 30, which you have decided will remain just an idea, because you are not interested in actually turning 30 — you’re only startled back into being a person when your husband’s uncle and cousin die in quick succession. He spends hours on the phone with a family he can’t touch, all the cousins who look like shades of him. While he coughs through a tear, you angrily gaze at the small Hindu shrine you’ve built on your bookshelf. You’re not religious, but this year has made you desperate so you’ve taken to periodically lighting a candle at the feet of deities while offering various deals: If you don’t kill anyone, you can force me to keep this bad haircut indefinitely. If you make sure no one in my family gets hurt before we can see them again, you can put me in a little bit of debt. Not like Erika Jayne debt, though. Little debt. Cute debt. Debt I can joke about later.When your husband sleeps, you march up to the five of them. “I thought we had a deal? I thought lighting some nag champa and considering not eating meat on Tuesdays was the price??” They say nothing. You wonder if maybe you should join a cult instead. Advertisement  Your husband’s niece comes down with COVID, a result of still having to go to work through this collective year of agony. He frets about her quietly, how far she is from home too, how no one is there to take care of her. She’s in college, she should be out having fun. Like everything, this doesn’t feel fair either.The next week, you get your first American tax bill: an absolute assault of $10,000. You can pay it, but barely, in a way that brings your bank balance so low it makes you nauseous to look at your banking app. That same week, your husband’s niece and your aunt both recover within weeks of their first symptoms. You feel Lakshmi’s eyes on your back, her face cast in porcelain. You ask; I deliver.
 


Since the pandemic has halted largely everything about your life — except, allegedly, the passing of time — the biggest bash you can throw for your birthday is to drive upstate with your husband to a little house you’ve rented for a long weekend. It’s a brick cabin in a gated community, enshrined in ice after a few storms, which makes leaving the house a treacherous journey. The owner is a criminologist and former antiques dealer, giving the home a distinct “someone was murdered here” feel. The living room smells like mothballs and overflows with more rusty telescopes than you ever knew existed. One bookshelf is dedicated entirely to fragments of seashells. The kitchen is chaos; there’s a whole shelf just for gold-rimmed goblets, two AGA stoves that never turn off and rest at a fixed but indeterminate temperature, which makes cooking a bit of a magic trick. On the wall is an 1880s-era phone that doesn’t work, probably because the house doesn’t need you calling for help while the walls bleed and the home’s aura turns you inside out. It is a good place to contemplate your mortality. Advertisement  You tug on the cord leading to the attic and find two twin beds and a pile of furs. There are cabinets and closets with thick, impenetrable locks on them. This should be...fine.But who cares? This trip is for naught, because you’re not really turning 30. To turn 30 would suggest that the year you’ve spent in quarantine counted at all. It would suggest that time has been moving on as normal, which it clearly has not, evidenced by the fact that your body has not left your neighborhood in months. You entered the pandemic at the very beginning of your 29th year, so it’s impossible that you could be leaving it at 30 — or maybe even 31.You were raised in a family that required you to call every evening and use your vacation days to come home and visit. You’ve been calling, sure, but the conversations blend together, and there’s never any news, never any new stories to tell. You’re just happy your parents are alive and faking cheerfulness for your sake. No news, no progress, no time gone. So this isn’t really your 30th. You still have time to make it on a “30 Under 30” list, because this year doesn’t count.The day before your birthday, you rush to your husband excitedly with a plan. “Let’s do drugs tomorrow,” you say, hopping lightly on your toes while he toils away in the kitchen with the impossible stove that’s always on. He’s making cassoulet, the way your favorite restaurant in Toronto makes it. For days already, he’s been slow-cooking duck, simmering ragù, toasting bread crumbs, and braising sausage. “Do you really want to trip on your birthday?” he asks. Who knows. You mostly wanted to finish a book. But this is what young people do, and you are still young, because you are not yet 30. Advertisement  “We can,” your husband says, stirring the beans that have already been cooking for 16 hours. “But I made this big meal, and I want you to be able to enjoy it.” He looks at you worried and wounded that you’re tamping down your generally robust appetite. “You’re right,” you tell him with a quick kiss on the cheek, and let him go back to his beans. You spend some time in the attic excitedly looking for a body. You can only fight who you are for so long.
 


The morning of your birthday, you wake up and your husband presents you with videos from everyone you know and love, wishing you happy birthday from their little corners of the world, all huddled away from one another in case of death. He gets you an upsettingly overpriced hair dryer. You’re 30. It feels fine. When you post a photo of yourself on Instagram announcing your acceptance of this age, you’re feted with compliments about how “you look so much younger!” or “I thought you were older, you’re so accomplished!” Both are satisfying in different ways, and you bask like a pig in shit. Advertisement  Some of your best friends have scheduled a Zoom call for the afternoon. They’re your friends, but the closeness you feel with them even after exactly a year apart makes it feel like there should be a better word for them, one that contextualizes how they kept you alive during the nadir of your persistent depression.You chat with them for hours while draining a bottle of wine. Soon, you get sleepy and try to wind it down — everyone has virtual meeting fatigue, and you don’t want to make it worse for the faces you see in these little floating cubes, people who are similarly stuck in an emotional tundra, waiting for some kind of release. But suddenly, your friends all go on mute and start dropping off from the call, one by one. Then only Seb is left, and he peers at you while chewing on his nails. “I’ll send you a new link,” he says, disappearing himself.When you click on the new link, you’re transported to the University of Minnesota’s official Zoom account. A mistake? A prank, maybe? None of your friends are foolish enough to make such an error, and none of them are cruel enough to throw you into a first-year econ class on your birthday. But now you can make out the university’s Raptor Center. More importantly, you can see an owl called Ricky, who has rickets, who has been hired for your birthday to eat a mouse whole. Ricky gives you a little hoot and murders a mouse with three bites. It is horrific. You have never been so happy in your life. Imagine being so lucky that your friends — these people you met a decade ago, or even longer — know exactly what you want, which is to watch an owl choke down a mouse in your honor.The cassoulet is perfect. You have three servings. You and your husband sleep wrapped up together, like two trees that learned to grow around each other. Maybe it’s love, maybe you’re worried something is going to crawl out of the attic and kill you. Who cares. It’s a good feeling. Advertisement  Months later, when the ice melts, your friend Jenna holds your hand across a table at dinner in Bushwick and weeps about 30 being just around the corner for her. There were so many things she wanted to do before this birthday, so much taken from her in the last year and a half as well. She dabs at her impeccable eyeliner, stopping the bleed from running down her cheeks. “It’ll be OK,” you tell her, squeezing her hand in yours. “It’s just a birthday. How bad could it be?”Your niece gets a new dog, a little puppy she has named Beans. For years, you’ve been calling your niece Bean, and so now they are Bean and Beans, two little rats you love very much. Steve lives on in Beans’ shrieky bark and Bean’s unbridled happiness.You send a few pages of your book to your editor, finally, a year after she first emailed you waiting for a manuscript. “You’re right, they’re disjointed and stream of consciousness,” she tells you. “But there’s something there.” Are you relieved? Maybe — quitting altogether would’ve been nice, too.“I think the problem is you’re still writing like you did before the pandemic. And it’s not working because you’re not that person anymore. And I don’t know if you like the person you’ve become. How are you supposed to write about someone you don’t like?” You pull on the stack of new grey hairs you have sprouting from your temple.“For what it’s worth,” she finishes, “I like who you became. I think she’s great.” It’s been years since you’ve liked yourself, even longer since you’ve been able to verbalize it, but you did once, and maybe you can again. That afternoon, you sit with who you are now, and you get back to work. ● Advertisement

When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.”Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia. Advertisement  “I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.”
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.”“I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.”Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.” Advertisement  
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context. Advertisement     On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes). We typically use these to test our colleagues in the newsroom, but we publish them for the readers who are so inclined to take them. Here’s one from July with the theme of TikTok trends, and a supernatural style quiz from October.Finally, don’t miss our favorite year-end traditions: The Best, Worst, and Funniest Corrections and The Best Grammar Memes and Tweets (most of which are from us — what about it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).What's New?Here are some of the additions and changes we made to the style guide in 2021!ableist terms: added alternatives words to use instead of those that have ableist connotations or make light of disabilities (instead of crippled or handicapped, use hampered, obstructed, or inhibited; instead of tone-deaf, use insensitive, obtuse, or oblivious).Afghan (citizens of Afghanistan), afghani (currency)antisemitism (no hyphen)copy desk (replaced copydesk); copy editor (n.)coronavirus pandemic: Capitalize the Greek alphabet name assigned to a variant by the WHO, e.g., the Omicron variant.disinformation: the intentional spreading of false or misleading information, often for political gain (e.g., a disinformation campaign); misinformation refers to falsehoods more generally, without a specific intentfirst gentleman: like first family and first lady, always lowercase as they’re not formal titles, e.g., first lady Jill Biden (first partner, anyone?)older adults or older person/people: Use these rather than senior citizens, seniors, or elderly.

No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.”It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate. Advertisement  But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future.
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day.Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted. Advertisement  “It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital.“He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3. Advertisement  Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey.“The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded. Advertisement  “It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes.Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.” Advertisement  
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking.That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything. Advertisement     “I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.”Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.” Advertisement     Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida.“I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

Governments around the world are struggling to suppress a tidal wave of the Omicron variant, which appears to be spreading faster and evading vaccines more efficiently than any previous COVID-19 variant. Most developed nations have responded to this threat by encouraging their populations to get booster shots and doubling down on vaccination efforts on their home turf.As the head of a global organization dedicated to vaccinating the world, I can see that focusing on this alone is a dangerous mistake.If the priority with each new variant of concern is to race toward reopening society by offering boosters instead of tackling the root cause — namely, the fact that nearly 3.5 billion people still have not been vaccinated — then we could face an endless cycle of resurgences and leave the door open for more dangerous variants. Advertisement     This crisis is far from over, and we will never end it until we stop the virus from spreading in all parts of the world.Even though clinical infection with Omicron appears to be more resistant to vaccines, to the best of our knowledge, global vaccination still remains the most effective way to protect people from severe disease and death. Vaccination, even in the Omicron era, likely prevents the overwhelming of health systems and slows transmission, preventing further mutations and new variants from emerging.Yet, more than a year after COVID-19 vaccines first became available, about 43% of the world — predominantly people living in the poorest countries — have not yet had their first shot.Initially, the main reason for this was vaccine hoarding by the world’s wealthiest countries, as well as export restrictions imposed by some countries on both vaccines and the materials needed to make them.This has severely hampered the global effort led by COVAX — a collaboration between Gavi, my organization, UNICEF, WHO, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — to make COVID-19 vaccines equitably available to people in all corners of the world, particularly the 92 lower-income countries that would have otherwise struggled to get access.The good news is that with 1.5 billion doses now being manufactured a month and 12 billion expected to be produced in total by the end of the year — enough to fully vaccinate everyone on this planet — global supply constraints are now easing and governments are throwing their weight behind COVAX. Advertisement     By the end of the month, COVAX will have allocated 1.6 billion doses and will have shipped over 900 million doses to 144 economies, the vast majority to lower-income countries. And by early 2022, we will have shipped enough doses to reach our original target of protecting on average around 20% of people in most of these countries, including all those most at risk, such as frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable people.However, the danger now with Omicron is that if governments once again turn their attention inward and focus all attention toward making boosters available to their citizens, it could again start to hinder equitable access and further prolong the global crisis. Or if the science determines that new variant-specific vaccines are necessary, it seems likely these new vaccines could be hoarded and not made available to those living in lower-income countries.At first glance, the case for boosters may seem strong, with evidence to suggest that a third dose can provide additional protection and prevent people from becoming infected. But while this could help to slow the spread of this new variant, we still don’t know Omicron’s potential to cause harm.Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that two doses of existing vaccines are any less effective against Omicron in protecting people from severe disease, hospitalization, or death. This means that getting boosters to low-risk people who already have some protection will only have a limited impact on fighting the disease if we don’t also radically reduce the number of people who are still unvaccinated.Yet, since Omicron emerged, we have already started to see some donor governments slowing the speed at which they are donating vaccines to COVAX, and if high-income countries increase their purchases of products, the worry now is that COVAX’s own supply lines will start to suffer. Advertisement     Boosters are only ever likely to provide a temporary fix so long as the virus is allowed to spread freely elsewhere in the world. It does now seem highly likely that the COVID-19 endgame will mean it eventually becomes endemic. But we will get no closer to that point if, with each resurgence, we don’t start addressing the cause of new variants. That must be the priority for 2022: getting primary doses to everyone.If we end up in a situation where we face Pi, Rho, Sigma, or Tao variants, and fourth, fifth, or sixth booster shots are being offered to some people while billions of others are still waiting on their first, then we really shouldn’t wonder why we are still in a state of global crisis.

175,Remembering some of the people in the public eye who died this year.,"


Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking charges Wednesday, bringing an end to the federal case in which she stood accused of assisting Jeffrey Epstein in his decadelong scheme of grooming and sexually abusing girls as young as 14.The Associated Press reported that Maxwell was found guilty of five of the six federal charges against her. She now faces years in prison.In the government’s closing argument on Dec. 20, Assistant US Attorney Alison Moe described Maxwell as a “dangerous” woman who “preyed on vulnerable kids.”“Maxwell was a sophisticated predator who knew exactly what she was doing. She ran the same playbook again and again,” Moe said. “She manipulated her victims, and she groomed them for sexual abuse. She caused deep and lasting harm to young girls. It is time to hold her accountable.” Advertisement     The 60-year-old daughter of a British media magnate, Maxwell is the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Epstein, the former financier and convicted sex offender, whose death in prison while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges on Aug. 10, 2019, was ruled a suicide. With his death coming before he faced a jury, Maxwell’s case marked a major milestone in a saga that has stretched decades, only drawing renewed attention after a series of articles in the Miami Herald highlighting how the justice system had failed the women who said they were abused.She was arrested on July 20, 2020, after disappearing from the public eye for more than a year. (The FBI tracked Maxwell to Bradford, New Hampshire, using data and coordinates from her cellphone.) She was deemed a flight risk and has been held without bail since her arrest. She was found guilty of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor. The jury found her not guilty of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, the AP reported.""I want to commend the bravery of the girls — now grown women — who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom,"" US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict was announced. ""Their courage and willingness to face their abuser made this case, and today’s result, possible.""Maxwell had pleaded not guilty to all the charges and declined to testify, claiming “there is no need” for her to do so because “the government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.” Advertisement     During the three-week trial, four women testified that Epstein had sexually abused them while they were between the ages of 14 and 17, and that Maxwell assisted in grooming them and occasionally participated in the abuse herself. According to prosecutors and the victims’ testimonies, Maxwell and Epstein sought out vulnerable young girls — particularly those in need of money, with single mothers and difficult home lives — and made them feel special and cared for, taking them shopping and to the movies, offering to pay for school, and asking them about their lives.Maxwell and Epstein were extravagantly wealthy and had many powerful, famous friends. One of the victims said they introduced her to both Donald Trump and Prince Andrew when she was 14, but did not accuse either of any misconduct. Epstein’s former pilot testified that Trump and Prince Andrew had been passengers on the private jet, as were Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, senators John Glenn and George Mitchell, and violinist Itzhak Perlman.Maxwell would serve as a normalizing presence during the meticulous grooming process, bringing up sexual topics, being naked or topless around them, and encouraging them to give Epstein massages. These massages were how Epstein typically initiated sexual contact with his victims — often with Maxwell in the room and instructing them how to touch him, to give the teenagers the impression what they were having done to them was normal, the women said. The sexual abuse would ramp up after that, often several times a week for years, with the girls at times being flown on Epstein’s private jet to visit him at his various homes.Maxwell was frequently present during these encounters, the women said, goading them into sex acts with Epstein. At times, Maxwell was also an active participant in the sexual abuse — three of the witnesses testified she had touched their breasts. One said Maxwell had her wear a schoolgirl outfit to serve Epstein tea, and another said she was made to participate in group sexual encounters with the couple and other people. Advertisement     “It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,” said one of the victims, who testified under the pseudonym Jane. “When you’re 14, you have no idea what’s going on.”This was precisely what made Maxwell “key to the whole operation,” Moe, the prosecutor, said in her closing argument.“Epstein could not have done this alone,” Moe said. “A single middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch, to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets off alarm bells.”“But when that man is accompanied by a posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that’s when everything starts to seem legitimate,” she continued. “And when that woman encourages those girls to massage that man, when she acts like it’s totally normal for the man to touch those girls, it lures them into a trap. It allows the man to silence the alarm bells and get away with molesting girls.”
 


Throughout the trial and in their closing argument, defense attorneys worked to discredit the witnesses’ testimonies, questioning whether their memories of the abuse were faulty or even outright invented. They also repeatedly accused the women of just being out for money, pointing to the fact that all four had previously received large settlements from a compensation fund for Epstein’s victims. Advertisement     They also claimed Maxwell was innocent of anything Epstein might have done, suggesting she was being treated as a scapegoat because he is no longer alive to face the consequences.In the defense’s closing argument, attorney Laura Menninger hammered these points home, claiming the women had “erroneous memories” and that their “stories have changed dramatically over time.” She honed in on minor discrepancies and details the accusers had not been certain of, even saying one was “like an actress who forgot her lines.”“As we have said from the beginning, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein,” Menninger said. “She’s being tried here for being with Jeffrey Epstein. Maybe that was the biggest mistake of her life, but it was not a crime.”In their rebuttal, the government urged the jury not to get “distracted by [the defense’s] nonsense.”“Never mind that [the accusers’ stories] corroborate each other, never mind the mountain of evidence that backs those four up, the defense is desperate for you not to believe these women,” Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said. “So they’re throwing up anything they can think of at the wall to see if anything will stick, but if you think about those arguments for just a little bit, you’ll see they don’t hold any water.”Comey hit back hard against the defense’s attempts to discredit the accusers’ memories, saying it would mean believing “all four of these women had a massive false memory event that just happened to include details of the defendant grooming them in the same way, using the same playbook.” Advertisement     “Some things you never forget because they’re seared into your brain forever,” she said.The defense also described the idea that Maxwell — a fixture in Epstein’s life — was simply unaware of the abuse as “borderline laughable.”“Of course she knew that her boyfriend, when he was spending time with teenage girls … he was doing it because he was attracted to them, because he wanted to have sex with them,” Comey said. “The suggestion that she didn’t know borders on the absurd.”Comey closed out her rebuttal by calling on the jury to “use your common sense” and believe the testimony of the four women who took the stand.“The defendant never thought that those teenage girls would have the strength to report what happened to them. In her eyes, they were just trash, beneath her,” Comey said. “Those girls would never stand up to a power couple like Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell — and if they ever did, who would believe them?”“But the defendant didn’t count on those teenage girls growing up into the women who testified at this trial — women who would be willing to take that stand and tell the truth about what happened,” she said.

The White House on Wednesday dug in against critics of the new CDC guidelines that shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five days for asymptomatic people infected by the coronavirus.Announced on Monday, the guidelines halved the isolation time — the period when people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should not be in contact with others — to five days. The five days begin when someone first shows symptoms; people should only emerge from the isolation afterward if those symptoms have stopped. They should then wear “well-fitting” masks for the next five days, according to the new guidelines, rather than continue in isolation. The change comes as COVID-19 cases hit their highest numbers for the entire pandemic, more than 240,000 cases a day on average. Advertisement     The revised policy attracted criticism from many outside public health experts, who said a negative antigen test should be required before someone ends their isolation, or that the shorter isolation should apply only to vaccinated people. The changes came just days after the CDC relaxed recommendations for infected healthcare workers to seven days of isolation, with a negative test.“Let me make clear that we are standing on the shoulders of two years of science, two years of understanding transmissibility,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday, defending the five-day guideline.Around 85% to 90% of viral transmissions, the “vast majority,” she said, happen in the first one to two days before people feel symptoms, and within the two to three days of those symptoms starting. COVID-19 symptoms include a cough, sore throat, headache, fever, chills, lost sense of taste, diarrhea, and other cold and flulike complaints.Walensky said that PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 genes could give positive results for weeks after a person ceases being infectious, making them useless in isolation decisions. The CDC did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation, she added, because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious. “On the other hand, we know that after five days people are much less likely to transmit the virus and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said, pointing to the five days of masking required after the isolation period as significant added protection. Advertisement     Nevertheless, critics such as University of Saskatchewan virologist Angela Rasmussen argue that a positive antigen test does point to some significant amount of virus still present in a patient, meaning they could be infectious. People should have that information before ending isolation, she suggested on Twitter, in response to Walensky.
 


The CDC’s relaxed policy has sparked derision on Twitter, where satirical takes on the agency’s permissiveness have (perhaps excessively) taken off:
 


But some independent experts have defended the agency’s reasoning.
 


Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday via email that he welcomed the news.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.”Yet Adalja cautioned that antigen testing would improve the protocol. “Rapid antigen tests, if they were widely available, should also be used to precision-guide these durations.”At the Wednesday White House briefing, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci cited continuing signs that the Omicron variant, now responsible for the majority of US cases, tends to cause severe illness less often.However, it’s unclear whether this means Omicron is an intrinsically less dangerous bug than previous variants. It could also be that Omicron seems milder because it is infecting more vaccinated people, who are mostly protected from severe disease.“Increased transmissibility of Omicron resulting in an extremely high volume of cases may override some of the impact of the lower disease severity,” Fauci said. “So we should not become complacent.”David Mack contributed reporting to this story.

177,"All you need is an owl, a cassoulet, and the constant specter of looming death.","


The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.

This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

181,Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests ,"


The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.

This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

183,"The summer of 2021, punctuated by extreme heat and flooding, showed that climate change is already deadly.","


By 1964, just three years after she started writing searching personal essays for Vogue, Joan Didion was plainly itching to write about something other than herself. Her life was also changing. She had published a slim novel, Run River, whose journey to the bookstore had been a grand disappointment. The title had been chosen by the publisher, and the editor had altered the form of the novel entirely, changing its experimental structure into something quite conventional. She had also married John Gregory Dunne, a sometime friend, after he’d supported her through the end of a long love affair. The pair decided to quit their magazine jobs and move to California, where they had a vague plan to make careers in television.Vogue, apparently unwilling to cut apron strings altogether, asked Didion to begin reviewing films for it. In her opening column for 1964, written just a month before she married, Didion declared her critical approach would be somewhat democratic:Let me lay it on the line: I like movies, and approach them with a tolerance so fond that it will possibly strike you as simple-minded. To engage my glazed attention a movie need be no classic of its kind, need be neither L’Avventura or Red River, neither Casablanca nor Citizen Kane; I ask only that it have its moments.She went on to cast positive votes for The Philadelphia Story, The Spirit of St Louis, and Charade. Pauline Kael had not yet quite broken through to mainstream movie reviewing and I Lost It at the Movies hadn’t yet been published, but we can see in Didion’s words a relatively similar approach. She too would spend her career insisting there were moments of brilliance even in what was unquestionably trash.
 


Didion alternated her assignment on the movies with another writer, which seems to have prevented her from reviewing memorable films. She was trying to write with flair, though, in short spaces, and most of the reviews are sprightly, wisecracking things that seem more like Parker than Didion. She hated The Pink Panther: “possibly the only seduction ever screened (David Niven vs. The Princess) with all the banality of the real thing.” She liked The Unsinkable Molly Brown, but commented that Debbie Reynolds “tends to play these things as if the West was won by jumping up and down and shouting at it.” She confessed a weakness for teenage surfing movies, “an enthusiasm I should try to pass off as sociological.” Like Kael, she too hated The Sound of Music, calling it:More embarrassing than most, if only because of its suggestion that history need not happen to people like Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Just whistle a happy tune, and leave the Anschluss behind.Gradually, though, Didion got bored with film reviews. Her review of The Sound of Music was so caustic that Vogue fired her, as she tells it. (This was another connection to Kael, who had been fired for panning the same movie at McCall’s.) In any event, she was moving on to other subjects in a column that she and Dunne soon set up at the Saturday Evening Post.
 


At the Post, Didion’s writing would undergo a major shift in tone, too. There are hints of the elegiac, distinctive earlier Didion voice in “On Self-Respect,” and in another essay she wrote for Vogue on American summers. But, given the Post’s willingness to send her into the field, she found a groove. It helped that California of the 1960s was fertile ground for twisting stories that provided Didion with the opportunity to follow a disturbing note longer than a column or two. She started off writing for the Post about Helen Gurley Brown (whom she found silly) and John Wayne (whom she did not), but it was the first of the crime pieces that hit a chord with the magazine’s readers — and also reads as the first true Didion piece.It was titled “How Can I Tell Them There’s Nothing Left?” But the title Didion would give it in her own collection, “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream,” was the one that would stick. Nominally chronicling a local murder, in which a wife was accused of burning her husband to death in the family car, Didion immediately pulled back to a wide-angle view of everything that was plaguing California, not to mention most of the rest of America:This is the California where it is easy to Dial-a-Devotion, but hard to buy a book. This is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life’s promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and a return to hairdresser’s school.The woman was eventually convicted of murdering her husband, but naturally the residents of the San Bernardino valley—the part of California Didion was describing in that long, unwinding opening paragraph—did not take kindly to being characterized this way. “I am worried about Joan Didion,” wrote one Howard B. Weeks, who also listed his profession: vice president for public relations and development at Loma Linda University. “We recognize these feelings as symptoms commonly observed in young New York writers who venture into the Great Unknown beyond the Hudson.” This letter illustrates that Didion hadn’t quite yet broken through to the mainstream; Howard B. Weeks did not know he was lecturing the woman who would become the signature American writer from California on the subject of her own home.Didion did not slide into her groove immediately. The next piece she wrote seemed almost a step away from anything that could possibly annoy anyone. It was entitled “The Big Rock Candy Figgy Pudding Pitfall.” Despite her having savaged Helen Gurley Brown and J. D. Salinger for being essentially trivial persons, one guesses this was the kind of piece Didion wrote for money. It details an effort to cook twenty figgy puddings and make twenty hard-candy trees. But it seemed to reflect a state of distress about how her domestic arrangements were working out:I am frail, lazy and unsuited to doing anything except what I am paid to do, which is sit by myself and type with one finger. I like to imagine myself a “can-do” kind of woman, capable of patching the corral fence, pickling enough peaches to feed the hands all winter, and then winning a trip to Minneapolis in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. In fact, the day I stop believing that if put to it I could win the Pillsbury Bake-Off will signal the death of something.Dunne appears in this article as a benevolent, comic figure, who upon confrontation with the supplies asks, “Exactly what kind of therapy are we up to this week?” But nowhere in this article does Didion mention that earlier that year, she and Dunne had adopted a child they named Quintana Roo Dunne. The anxiety, though, about being some kind of domestic goddess—“the kind of woman who made hard-candy topiary trees and figgy puddings”—smells of what the women’s magazines all call nesting.
 


For one of the first issues of the new year, she wrote an essay the magazine entitled “Farewell to the Enchanted City.” (Later generations of readers would come to know it better by the title “Goodbye to All That.”) This was when the first hint of her career-long obsession with the stories we tell ourselves would begin to explicitly emerge. Didion suggests that the New York of her imagination had dominated the real one the whole time she actually lived there:Some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever heard about New York, informed me that it would never be quite the same again. In fact it never was. Some time later there was a song in the jukeboxes on the Upper East Side that went “but where is the schoolgirl who used to be me,” and if it was late enough at night I used to wonder that. I know now that almost everyone wonders something like that, sooner or later and no matter what he or she is doing, but one of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before.
 


This essay is so famous it is said to have spawned its own mini genre of essays about leaving New York. Like the song on the jukebox, it expresses the feelings everyone has about a common experience. The brilliance of the essay is that even in the act of writing it Didion reenacts an emotional cliché, the narrator telling a past self how silly and stupid she was to fall for a story that everyone falls for. This self-conscious style, a personal matter conveyed at a distance, would become Didion’s signature. Even when she wrote about something as personal as her divorce, she did it at a remove, turning it over in her hand, polishing it to a shine that concealed certain roughnesses in the center.Dunne and Didion soon had a regular column in the Saturday Evening Post, sharing a byline. It looks odd to contemporary eyes, especially because of the illustration the magazine used at the top of each column, drawings of them both. If Dunne had written the column, the illustration would show his face in front of Didion’s; if she had written it, her face would move in front of his.Her columns were generally the more interesting explorations of the pair, her knack for inspiring a reaction was top-notch. Her essay on migraines would appear in that space, as would her reporting of a decommissioned Alcatraz and a devastating sketch of Nancy Reagan, then the first lady of California:She has told me that the governor never wore makeup even in motion pictures and that politics is rougher than the picture business because you do not have the studio to protect you . . . “Having a pretty place to work is important to a man,” she has advised me. She has shown me the apothecary jar of hard candies she keeps filled on the governor’s desk.Almost a month later, Nancy Reagan was still smarting from the sting, telling the Fresno Bee, “I thought we were getting along fine together. Maybe it would have been better if I snarled a bit.”This technique—appearing to let the subject simply carry on without interruption from Didion’s evaluations or thoughts making themselves absurd—became her standard mode of operation. It would be the way she would spend large swaths of her famous explorations in Haight-Ashbury. She would begin the essay with a long incantation about how the “center was not holding,” then trek into the widening abyss to find people who would reveal themselves in a line or two. Meeting two young Deadheads, for example:I ask a couple of girls what they do. “I just kind of come out here a lot,” one of them says. “I just sort of know the Dead,” the other says.The flatness of these answers spoke for the emptiness of those who spoke them. Most of the readers of the Saturday Evening Post agreed with Didion on this point, the letters unusually full of praise for her insight into the barbarians of the hippie cult, as it was popular to call them at the time. There were some objectors, like Sunnie “The Daisy” Brentwood, who continued to insist that “the majority of the flower children are good kids who are trying to improve the world and make it a better place to live.”
 


Didion’s view won out in the end, not least because this essay would become the title piece of her stand-alone 1968 collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the book that established Didion’s reputation. Reviewing it for the New York Times, Didion’s friend Dan Wakefield argued that Didion was “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation.” He pointed out that Didion was easier to interpret, for example, than another trendy young woman writer of the moment named Susan Sontag. Wakefield’s thorough celebration of the book was echoed by just about every reviewer. Some of them stumbled over the pairing of Didion’s brilliance with her gender: Melvin Maddocks of the Christian Science Monitor cryptically remarked, in what appeared to be a compliment:Journalism by women is the price the man’s world pays for having disappointed them. Here at their best are the unforgiving eye, the unforgetting ear, the concealed hat-pin style.That is one way of looking at it; though the reference to hat pins is clearly trivializing, the notion that the opinions were a “price” rather than a gift is somewhat revealing. Didion had cultivated a persona in her writing that was just as disappointed with women—Gurley Brown, the Deadheads, Nancy Reagan, the figgy pudding domestics—as it was with the “man’s world,” wherever that was. It wasn’t feminine so much as just perceptive, sharp. Certain doors of perception are more open to women, but it doesn’t mean that men can’t see what women are pointing out, if only they’d settle down, listen, and look.After Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the literary profilers came out of the woodwork. In droves, they began to interview her, attaching the beautiful photographs of her slight frame to headlines like “Joan Didion: Writer with Razor’s Edge,” and “Slouching Towards Joan Didion.” It was by then the 1970s. Alfred Kazin, that old friend of Hannah Arendt’s, promptly got himself assigned to fly out to California. He met the Didion-Dunnes in high spirits at the house they then occupied in Malibu, together writing a screenplay based on Play It as It Lays, her 1970 novel about a dissatisfied actress named Maria Wyeth that had gotten her rave reviews. Kazin noted the difference between the way Didion often spoke of herself in print: as fragile, ill, on the verge of divorce in a famous Life column in 1969, and the way she was in person, more a creature of sensible steel than frivolous silk:Joan Didion is a creature of many advantages, as is clear from her own belief that she had the sense to get born and to grow up in Sacramento before so many discomfiting things began to happen to the Golden State.Kazin continued to catalog discrepancies. Didion’s voice was “so much stronger than her own little girl’s voice!” Though the address in Malibu would seem to connote relaxation, he finds the sound of the waves below deafening: “People who live in a beach house don’t know how wary it makes them.” He called her a moralist, pointed out that she had an obsession with seriousness. He notes that always she was writing as a cultural critic, even in fiction, wanting to diagnose the ills of whatever subject she had—a propensity she shared with Mary McCarthy, though their fiction voices are far apart. He even connected her with Arendt, who had once told him that Americans seemed to despair far more than she had ever seen people do in Europe.By the time Kazin’s profile was published, Didion was, quite simply, a star. But the Saturday Evening Post, the place that had let her write lyrically about migraines, about going home to Sacramento, or that flew her to Hawaii for a piece, had folded. She looked for other homes. Life magazine offered her a contract to write a column. But the relationship soured immediately; Didion asked to go to Saigon, because many writers—including Sontag and McCarthy—had already been there. Her editor demurred, telling her that “some of the guys are going out.” Her anger at this blithe dismissal turned into the now-famous column she wrote about visiting Hawaii during the prediction of a huge tidal wave:My husband switches off the television set and stares out the window. I avoid his eyes, and brush the baby’s hair. In the absence of a natural disaster we are left again to our own uneasy devices. We are here on this island in the middle of the Pacific in lieu of filing for divorce.
 


This essay poses as self-revelation, but here the frame of marital trouble dissolves. Didion begins telling you instead how disconnected she had felt from everything, how difficult it was to feel. She confesses that she has become, as that old boyfriend predicted, someone who feels nothing. The piece is so relentlessly dark and despairing it is no wonder the Life editors were apparently startled by it. They gave it a title that reflected their bewilderment: “A Problem of Making Connections.” Subsequent deeply personal columns were not to their taste either, and Didion would end up relinquishing the contract before it was up because the editors would not run her column. She would get back at the editor for his nonchalant remark many years later, when she’d report it in The Year of Magical Thinking.This hints at something important about Didion’s work: even when she is reporting unendurable despair, feeling that her life is falling apart alongside the country’s, another engine is at work there. No person as depressed and lost as Didion purports to be could possibly draft prose this precise, words that cut so directly to the heart of her subject. In the case of the confession of her potential divorce, the engine behind it was anger, anger at having been prevented from using the full measure of her powers by an editor who considered Joan Didion less daring a writer than the “guys” going out to Saigon. It was a mistake that belongs in the museum of poor editorial decisions.Didion returned to novel writing. She occasionally contributed to Esquire, but had trouble fitting in there too. She was one of the boys, clearly, in the sense that men had noticed her writing and wanted to publish her. But she also couldn’t quite fit into their regime.Still, turning to the women’s magazines would have been intolerable for her, just when the women’s liberation movement was at its height. Like Sontag, she was no doubt being asked about her loyalty to the consciousness-raising circles that were suddenly everywhere. But she does not seem to have directly commented until finally, in 1972, she published an essay called “The Women’s Movement” in the pages of the New York Times. She listed sixteen books as inspiration. But she had clearly been moved to frustration by the “special issue on women” that Time had published some months before.Didion was not willing to grant much ground or sense to the nascent second wave of feminism. She leveled some of the most direct insults of her career at it. “It seemed very New England, this febrile and cerebral passion,” she said of the radical feminist writings of Shulamith Firestone. She referred to some of the movement’s methods as Stalinist, singling out the British writer Juliet Mitchell’s relation of Maoist practice to the consciousness-raising session. She also defended Mary McCarthy from those feminist theorists who would deconstruct her heroines in The Company She Keeps and The Group into an unrecognizable, overly politicized caricature: “enslaved because she persists in looking for her identity in a man.”
 


Yet there was something less than a total rejection of the notion of feminism going on in Didion’s article. She presented herself as merely worried that what she sweepingly saw as one unified movement had become mired in arguments over trivial issues, like the division of domestic duties such as washing the dishes.Of course this litany of trivia was crucial to the movement in the beginning, a key technique in the politicizing of women who perhaps had been conditioned to obscure their resentments even from themselves . . . But such discoveries could be of no use at all if one refused to perceive the larger point, failed to make that inductive leap from the personal to the political.Didion also thought that in their books the feminists had constructed a kind of self-delusion, one she called Everywoman, “persecuted even by her gynecologist,” “raped on every date.” Didion did not deny that women were victims of condescension and sex-role stereotyping. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine how she could, given the way she was written about in the period, given her inability to fit tidily into the male-dominated magazine world. But she found the expressed wishes of the main movement writers to be childish in the extreme. “These are converts who want not a revolution but ‘romance,’” she concluded.Didion had addressed the condition of women several times before, often in the context of writing about Doris Lessing. She wrote about her twice: once for Vogue and once for the New York Times Book Review. In Vogue, she’d had only enough space to say she did not share Lessing’s view that there was some “injustice” involved in being a woman. By the time Didion was enlisted to review the science fiction novel Briefing for a Descent into Hell, she had softened her view of Lessing, in part because Lessing had softened her view of feminist politics by then. Briefing, which as Lessing termed it, was an “inner space fiction,” was more about madness and alienation than about a critique of modern social structures. And while Didion didn’t particularly like it, she went out of her way to congratulate Lessing on what she saw as Lessing’s disenchantment with all blunt forms of political thought and action, as Didion saw feminism to be:The impulse to find solutions has been not only her dilemma but the guiding delusion of her time. It is not an impulse I hold high, but there is something finally very moving about Mrs. Lessing’s tenacity.There’s a little daylight between Didion and her rejection of feminism, here. It seemed, in a cloaked way, that she had some sympathy for the aims and hopes of those feminists whose tactics and writing she still detested. It was not much, but it was something.This is something that could not really be said for the other side. Several feminist activists wrote to the Times to complain, among them Susan Brownmiller, whose Against Our Will had been listed as one of the books examined in the essay. Pointing out that Didion had never exactly positioned herself as a leftist, and had written for the National Review, Brownmiller cryptically continued:Isn’t it interesting that the real toughies are always on the other side? I’ll take boots and blue jeans over manicured, Mandarin fingernails any day of the week.The piece would cut Didion forever out of the women’s movement. In fact, it inaugurated a common complaint about her: that she was, in her own way, acting out a certain kind of stereotypical femininity. And for all her defense of complexity, she was afraid to recognize that there were any number of interior ideological fights going on in the movement she was describing: the novelist Alix Kates Shulman was on one side of the fence, and the tract-writer Shulamith Firestone on another. But in Didion’s view they were all the same, all the Everywoman, all capable of making different choices from the ones they had made.For the rest of the 1970s, Didion mostly threw herself into film-making and fiction. She and Dunne would work on a film version of Play It as It Lays, as well as an update of A Star Is Born. She published A Book of Common Prayer. She had the occasional article in Esquire, but her energy seemed subdued. The Didion-Dunnes, who had avoided divorce more than once in the intervening years, were great party givers, and that took up time too. It wouldn’t be until the end of the decade that she’d publish a second collection of nonfiction called The White Album.
 


The title essay, “The White Album,” which begins with the famous incantation, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” is a fragmentary bit of work. Though that first line is often quoted as a kind of self-help mantra, in the essay proper Didion goes on to list delusional fantasies, finally concluding that writers especially are guilty of imposing a kind of narrative order on existence that simply “freeze[s] the shifting phantasmagoria of our experience.”Some of the elements of the essay included projects that Didion had tried to take up, and which had failed, over the years. Specifically, she mentions an acquaintance with Linda Kasabian, the twenty-three-year-old member of the Manson family who had driven the car when a group of them murdered Sharon Tate and her houseguests in August 1969.On the outside, the Kasabian story had looked like a perfect Didion subject. Here was a person who had gotten caught up in the promises of love and grooviness that were the allure of the hippie movement—the promises that, as Didion had written, at length, were bogus. Kasabian had gone so far that she got caught up in the most notorious murders in America, murders so savage they stood out in a country that treated crime as nighttime entertainment. But Didion never got the project under way. Instead the Manson murders, and Linda Kasabian, became another dreamlike element in the political and social morass of the late 1960s, years when Didion would write that she barely knew her own mind:I remember all the day’s misinformation very clearly, and I also remember this, and wish I did not. I remember that no one was surprised.In The White Album, Didion never says what shook her out of her misery at the morally and philosophically empty conditions of the 1960s, not exactly. It could have been the films she was making, or that she was finally being recognized as a proper novelist. A Book of Common Prayer was very well received. It could be that without the violence and anomie of the 1960s, she found herself enjoying life suddenly. Quintana was growing up, her marriage got past its rough point, and she was making good money.
 


It was in the 1970s that she got very lucky. She met an editor who, like her old ones at the Saturday Evening Post, was prepared to let her talent work for itself in nonfiction articles. Bob Silvers, who was now one of the two lead editors of the New York Review of Books, was happy to let Didion roam over the pages of the magazine. Her first piece was nominally a review of Stanley Kauffmann’s film criticism in the New Republic, though Didion had other targets in mind:I used to wonder how Pauline Kael, say, could slip in and out of such airy subordinate clauses as “now that the studios are collapsing,” or how she could so misread the labyrinthine propriety of Industry evenings as to characterize “Hollywood wives” as women “whose jaws get a hard set from the nights when they sit soberly at parties waiting to take their sloshed geniuses home.”Didion proceeded to mock those, like Kael and Kauffmann, who wrote about film without having any idea how a film was produced and made. She said the most they could hope for was to bring a specific brand of intelligence to film, but that it was “a kind of petit-point-on-Kleenex effect which rarely stands much scrutiny.”Kauffmann, upon reading the review, discovered that in fact he was little-mentioned in it, and that four of the quotes Didion used had come from an entirely different book he had written. He wrote in to the New York Review to state his objection, and added:A possible reason: In the December 9, 1972, issue of the New Republic, I reviewed Miss Didion’s film Play It as It Lays, referred to her novel of that name, and stated my utter loathing of both. (On much the same grounds that she substantiates in her article: the film pretended to deal with serious subjects but was patently an industry product.) Perhaps Miss Didion would dislike my writing just as much if I had praised her work. I hope so. But your readers might care to know about a possible tit for tat.Didion was typically cutting in reply. Had he reviewed her work positively, she insisted, she would still dislike his work, and “I would also have some doubts about my own.”
 


“Self-absorption is general, as is self-doubt,” she’d memorably begin that Woody Allen piece. Her complaints about Allen were pretty much the same ones she’d voiced eighteen years before about J. D. Salinger. Allen’s characters were “clever children,” who spoke in smart remarks that no serious adult could sustain as easily. They were obsessed with trivialities when they listed among their reasons to live Willie Mays and Louis Armstrong:This list of Woody Allen’s is the ultimate consumer report, and the extent to which it has been quoted approvingly suggests a new class in America, a sub world of people rigid with apprehension that they will die wearing the wrong sneaker, naming the wrong symphony, preferring Madame Bovary.She called out the one character in Manhattan who is in high school. That was Mariel Hemingway’s Tracy, a character drawn in what Didion terms “another adolescent fantasy.” She found Tracy too utterly perfect, and with no real family to hold her back from dating Allen’s forty-year-old neurotic. A man wrote in to object, at length, to the way Didion had disrespected what was obviously his favorite filmmaker. Her reply? “Oh, wow.” ●

When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

WASHINGTON — Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader and five-term senator from Nevada, died Tuesday. He was 82.His wife, Landra Reid, said he died surrounded by family following four years of treatment for pancreatic cancer. Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in May 2018 and had said in 2020 that he was in “complete remission” after experimental treatments. Advertisement  “We are so proud of the legacy he leaves behind both on the national stage and his beloved Nevada,” she said in a statement.His death was immediately heralded by his longtime Senate colleagues.“He’s gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted.Reid, who grew up poor in the tiny mining town of Searchlight, Nevada, worked his way up to the top Democrat in the Senate. A chess master of Senate procedure and political kingmaker in Nevada, Reid retired from Congress in January 2017, but he continued to be involved in politics. In the 2018 midterm elections, Reid hand-selected Democratic candidates for Senate and governor — now-senator Jacky Rosen and current governor Steve Sisolak. Advertisement  With more than 30 years in Congress, Reid has been synonymous with Nevada politics for decades. The international airport in Las Vegas was officially renamed after him just this month.Reid was first elected to the US House in 1983, serving two terms before running for Senate in 1986. Over the next three decades, he rose through the ranks of Democratic leadership, eventually becoming the party’s top leader in the chamber in 2005.For just over a decade, he and Mitch McConnell traded off the titles of majority leader and minority leader as their parties took control of the Senate. The two men had a contentious relationship that was built not solely on antagonism, but also on a grudging respect. They considered each other friends, despite years of bitter legislative battles.As McConnell noted when Reid retired, the two senators had a lot in common, despite their strong political differences, including having similar ambitions growing up. “I wanted to throw fastballs for the Dodgers. Harry wanted to play center field at Fenway. We wound up as managers of two unruly franchises instead,” he joked.
 


Reid compared their relationship to two lawyers — which both were prior to entering Congress — arguing opposite sides of a case. “I want everyone here to know that Mitch McConnell is my friend. ... So everybody go ahead and make up all the stories you want about how we hate each other. Go ahead. But we don't,” he said.Senate AccomplishmentsReid served for 12 years as Democratic leader, one of the longest-serving party leaders in history. In that time, Reid oversaw many deals and failures. Among his personal highlights, he noted his work on suicide prevention, inspired by his own father’s suicide; his push to pass the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn recent executive branch regulations (McConnell later used this to rescind several late–Obama administration actions); and his fight to combat female genital mutilation (though he noted on FGM, “There's a lot more that needs to be done. Our government has done almost nothing.”).But Reid’s biggest legislative victory was passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Not only was the law the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since Medicare and Medicaid, it took a lot of legislative maneuvering to get through Congress, much of it led by Reid and his House counterpart, Nancy Pelosi — particularly after Sen. Ted Kennedy died and was replaced in the middle of the process by Republican Sen. Scott Brown, killing Democrats’ filibuster-proof majority.Reid often spoke of Obamacare as a major legislative achievement, but also a personal one. “It would have been wonderful if we had something like that around to help my family when we were growing up,” he said as he retired in 2017, also noting that his father’s depression played a role in his push for better healthcare. Advertisement  Reid was close with Obama as well and took credit in a CNN interview as the first to suggest to the then–Illinois senator that he should run for president. “I called him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. He was stunned because I was first to suggest it to him,"" Reid told the network. “When he was reelected I got a call saying, ‘As soon as he gets off the stand, he wants to talk to you.’ One of most moving phone calls ever received, he said, ‘You're the reason I'm here.’”""I care about Obama. He changed the world,"" he added.In his farewell address, Reid said that working with the Obama administration as majority leader was a “dream job.”On Tuesday, the former president shared a letter he had written Reid before his death.“You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,” Obama wrote. “I wouldn't have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn't have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.”
 


Yet perhaps Reid’s most lasting effect on the Senate itself was his decision to invoke the “nuclear option” in November 2013, allowing the Senate to move administration officials and judges forward with a simple majority rather than 60 votes needed at the time for cloture. At the time, Reid argued that lowering the number of votes needed to confirm federal judges and nominations to the executive was necessary to end constant Republican filibusters. (He later told CNN, however, that he was inspired in part by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer telling him that Republicans were mocking him, saying he’d never go through with it.) The gambit worked in some ways; after dropping that bomb in the Senate, Reid pushed Obama’s nominees for lifetime judgeships, leaving the president with 334 successful nominations, roughly as many as former president George W. Bush had gotten through during his presidency.But the nuclear option had its drawbacks as well, and there were critics of Reid’s decision in both parties even at the time. McConnell used that rule change to confirm even controversial members of former president Donald Trump’s cabinet and to jam through lower court judges. And in 2017, as many predicted, McConnell went nuclear himself — lowering the number of votes needed for Supreme Court nominees as well, which allowed Republicans to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the high court.While Reid’s decision to go nuclear laid the groundwork for McConnell’s expansion, some liberals argued Reid was wrong not to expand the rule change to the Supreme Court himself when Republicans refused to confirm Merrick Garland, who Obama had nominated in 2016. On the other side of the argument were Democrats like Schumer, who opposed going nuclear for executive branch nominees and came to regret the rule change after it was applied to Trump’s cabinet.Reid defended the decision, even after Trump was elected, writing in a December 2016 New York Times op-ed that “the rule change has been a victory for those who want to see a functioning, open and transparent Senate.” Advertisement  “I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump’s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump,” he wrote.Reid announced in 2016 he would retire, handing the reins over to his longtime mentee, Schumer. Reid told the New York Times at the time, “I want to be able to go out at the top of my game. I don’t want to be a 42-year-old trying to become a designated hitter.”
 


Controversy and Fighting With RepublicansThough he was soft-spoken, Reid could be brash and tough, showing flashes of what drove him as an amateur boxer in his youth during political bouts. He was a constant antagonist of the Republican Party, often skirting the truth to attack the right. Famously, in the 2012 presidential race, Reid claimed in a speech on the Senate floor that Mitt Romney, who released only two years of tax returns, hadn’t paid any taxes in a decade.That was a lie. And even years later, Reid wasn’t sorry about it. When asked if he regretted making the accusation, Reid told CNN in 2016, “Well, Romney didn’t win, did he?” Advertisement  Republican megadonors the Koch brothers were one of Reid’s favorite targets and most hated enemies. He devoted lengthy speeches to the brothers, calling their dark money investments in politics bad for the country and he relished using the line “Republicans are addicted to Koch.” Friends said his fixation on the Kochs was political — he’d later argue no one on the Democratic side was doing enough to counter the Kochs, so he just did it himself — but also personal; he felt very deeply that the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision loosening restrictions on money in politics was doing damage to the country and the Kochs were the biggest symbols of that.But Reid wasn’t as harsh toward Sheldon Adelson, another Republican megadonor who just happened to hail from Nevada. Reid once argued to MSNBC that Adelson, unlike the Kochs, wasn’t “in this for money.” “He’s in it because he has certain ideological views,” he added. “His social views are in keeping with the Democrats on choice, on all kinds of things. So, Sheldon Adelson, don’t pick on him — he’s not in it to make money.”
 


Early LifeBefore entering Congress, Reid’s life was straight out of a movie script. (He even inspired a scene in the movie Casino, which lifts some of Reid’s own lines.) He was born in Searchlight, a tiny town in the desert, and grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing. His father was a miner and his mother was a washer who cleaned clothes for the local casinos and the 13 brothels operating in the town of 250 people at the time, he often recalled. Advertisement  As he grew older, Reid became an amateur boxer and, as he acknowledged later in life, got into plenty of fights outside of the ring as well. In 2018, he was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame both for his own fighting career and for his advocacy for the sport while in the Senate.
 


He graduated college from Utah State University and later got his law degree from George Washington University. While in law school, Reid earned money by serving as a Capitol police officer, guarding the building he would later preside over.Reid’s father killed himself in 1972, a death that informed a lot of his later policymaking. He cited his father’s suicide in his push for increased funding to study depression as well as for suicide prevention efforts, but also in making his case for increased background checks for gun sales, as well as for the Affordable Care Act. Advertisement  In the late 1970s, Reid was appointed as the chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position where he oversaw the state’s casinos, which had a major mob influence at the time. In 1978, a Las Vegas man named Jack Gordon tried to bribe Reid to approve new gaming machines — an attempt that led to one of the more famous confrontations of Reid’s pre-political career. Reid reported the bribe to the FBI and worked with them on a sting to ensnare Gordon. Much to the surprise of FBI agents, when Reid met with Gordon, he grew increasingly angry and jumped across a table to choke the man, screaming, “You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!” before agents pulled him off and arrested Gordon.Three years later, Reid’s wife, Landra, found a car bomb attached to the gas tank of the family’s station wagon. Reid, who wrote about the incident in his autobiography The Good Fight, believed that Gordon was responsible. Gordon had spent six months in prison after the FBI sting Reid arranged but was never officially connected to the car bomb. It’s still unclear who was responsible.In 2015, Reid’s colorful past came back to haunt him in a bizarre conspiracy theory. The Senate Majority Leader had fallen after an exercise band snapped and threw him backward, causing him to break several ribs and injuring his face. He nearly went blind in his right eye and returned to Capitol Hill with a massive bandage over it that he later swapped out for dark sunglasses as he recovered. (Reid and his wife later sued the manufacturer of the exercise band.)But some conservative blogs and right-wing pundits didn’t buy the exercise band story and offered — without evidence — an alternative. One conservative blogger, citing a friend who had visited Las Vegas and asked around, suggested that Reid had been beaten up by the mob for not coming through on some kind of promise. Rush Limbaugh also said Reid looked like he’d been beaten up and said he didn’t believe the exercise band story. Breitbart went so far as to reconstruct Reid’s bathroom in detail from sales photos of the property in an attempt to disprove his story. Advertisement  Reid responded to the conspiracy theories in a CNBC interview, calling them ridiculous and largely blaming Limbaugh. “Why in the world would I come up with some story that I got hurt in my own bathroom with my wife standing there?” he asked.
 


Family LifeReid is survived by his wife, Landra, whom he met in high school and married at the age of 19. He has often described her as his first love and the love of his life. The two have five children and 19 grandchildren.In his tribute to Reid on the Senate floor in honor of his retirement, McConnell spoke at length about Reid’s relationship with his wife. “His idea of the perfect night out is still a quiet night in, with her,” McConnell said. “Landra’s his confidante, his high school sweetheart, his best friend. She’s his everything. And, for a guy who grew up with nothing, that’s something.” Advertisement     Landra had grown up Jewish (though she and Reid later converted to Mormonism), and her father opposed their marriage. At one point, Reid punched his future father-in-law in the face and Landra and Reid ended up eloping, though Reid said her family accepted them over time.In his own farewell speech on the Senate floor, Reid paid tribute to his wife, saying, “She has been the being of my existence, in my personal life and my public life. [Benjamin] Disraeli, the great prime minister, said in 1837: ‘The magic of first love is that it never ends.’ I believe that. She's my first love. It will never end.”Reid, in his speech, also shared the advice he had given to young people asking how to emulate his success. “I didn't make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn't make it because of my good looks. I didn't make it because I'm a genius. I made it because I worked hard, and I tell everyone whatever you want to try to do, make sure you're going to work as hard as you can at trying to do what you want to do. And I believe that's a lesson for everyone,” he said.“The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada. I'm grateful I've been part of that change.”

186,The White House is defending the CDC's new isolation guidelines for asymptomatic people infected by the coronavirus.,"


John Madden, the Hall of Fame football coach turned broadcasting icon, died unexpectedly on Tuesday, the NFL announced. He was 85.""On behalf of the entire NFL family, we extend our condolences to Virginia, Mike, Joe and their families,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""We all know him as the Hall of Fame coach of the Oakland Raiders and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather."" Advertisement     Though Madden was drafted to the Philadelphia Eagles after college, a knee injury prevented him from ever playing professionally. Instead, he pursued degrees in education and used those skills to embark on a successful coaching career.After stints in college football, he was hired by the Oakland Raiders as the linebackers coach in 1967. After two seasons, he became head coach; at just 32 years old, he was the youngest to hold that position in the American Football League.
 


Over 10 seasons, he led the Raiders to win 103 games in the regular season, with just 32 losses and seven ties. They won Super Bowl XI in 1977, part of a 17-game winning streak that was just shy of what was then the NFL record for consecutive wins.As remarkable as his coaching career was, Madden had perhaps even more of an impact in media. In 1979, he joined CBS as a color commentator and would go on to become the first sports broadcaster to work for all of the major networks.He appeared on radio, in ads, and even in a couple of movies. But his work in video games was revolutionary. The first Madden NFL game debuted in 1988 and spawned a bestselling cultural juggernaut estimated to have sold at least 250 million copies. When he was first approached, Madden thought the format might have potential as a coaching tool, ESPN reported, and his expertise became the foundation of gameplay that mimicked real football.After all, football is what Madden was about.""Football is what I am. I didn’t go into it to make a living or because I enjoyed it. There is much more to it than just enjoying it. I am totally consumed by football, totally involved,"" he once said. ""I’m not into gardening … or any other hobbies. I don’t fish or hunt. I’m in football.”

188,"A distressed orca was stuck on rocks, so these good samaritans did their best to help ","


On the quiet Monday after the Christmas weekend, the CDC took many people by surprise — experts included — by releasing updated guidance for how long people with COVID-19 should isolate themselves.The new guidance halves the number of days that people should self-isolate after testing positive from 10 to five, followed by an additional five days of wearing a mask when around others. Advertisement     Crucially, the shorter isolation period only applies to people who are asymptomatic, meaning they are not exhibiting any COVID symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or fatigue. People who are still feeling sick, especially with a fever, should continue to isolate themselves.Guidance also changed for people who have been exposed to someone with COVID. Now, in a signal that our understanding of “fully vaccinated” may be changing, only people who have had their booster shot can go without quarantining. A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is recommended following exposure for anyone else: people who are unvaccinated, who got an mRNA vaccine dose more than six months ago without a booster, or who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than two months ago without a booster.“I was not aware they were going to do that,” Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA), told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “But the essence of what they said is that as we get the science better, we have a better sense, even with Omicron, of what the exposure risks are.”Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the changes.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.” Advertisement     The CDC stressed its new advice was “motivated by science” that demonstrates most transmission of the novel coronavirus occurs within the first few days before symptoms appear and then over the next two to three days.The recommendations “balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses,” agency director Rochelle Walensky said. “These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.”
 


Speaking to CNN on Monday afternoon, Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said the new guidance had been discussed for some time and called the changes “very prudent” at this current stage of the pandemic.Like Walensky, Fauci stressed that the recommendations would help the US continue to function as the country faces an unprecedented number of COVID cases in the weeks ahead due to the highly infectious Omicron variant. Advertisement     “With the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is we don’t have so many people out,” Fauci said.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” he added, “but if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”The APHA’s Benjamin said these new changes were aimed at avoiding yet more harsh lockdowns. “Without this, we go back to the total closures, which nobody has the stomach for right now,” he said. “The politics for that just aren’t there.”The changes were announced four days after the CDC said asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days if they test negative. That update was made out of concern that hospitals would be hamstrung by staff shortages as the Omicron variant spreads through medical facilities.But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they were confused why the same negative test requirement, even via a rapid antigen test, was not made for the general public to exit isolation.“I think finding ways to shorten isolation time is a great idea — 10 days is very disruptive — but with testing,” said virologist Angela Rasmussen, who called the CDC’s new changes “reckless.” Advertisement     “Seems the CDC is now just letting big corporations suggest policy and they are saying, ‘Let’s go with it,’” she added. “But it’s not the scientists at the CDC. It’s Walensky and her bosses in Washington who are dictating it, I think.”Epidemiologist Michael Mina also said that it was “reckless” to allow people to leave isolation without first testing negative, noting that he would not want to sit next to someone who tested positive five days ago.“I am 100% for getting people to drop isolation early,” Mina wrote on Twitter. “But it was always with a negative test. What the heck are we doing here?”Business leaders have been calling for changes to the isolation time for so-called breakthrough cases (vaccinated people who contract COVID) to minimize disruptions to the economy. Last week, before several thousand flights were canceled around the world partly due to sick crew members, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian asked Walensky to reduce the isolation time to five days for vaccinated people. He said the 10-day requirement “may significantly impact [the airline’s] workforce and operations.” But, according to Reuters, Bastian also said appropriate testing could play a role.When asked Tuesday why a negative test was not made part of the updated guidance, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund again emphasized that most transmission occurs early in the first five days of a COVID infection. She said that for the purpose of a diagnosis, both PCR and rapid antigen tests were best used early in the course of illness. “Some people may remain positive by PCR test beyond the period of expected infectiousness,” Nordlund said. “The importance of a positive antigen test late in the course of illness is unclear and does not necessarily mean a person can easily spread the virus.”But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they suspected the lack of a testing requirement was due to more practical concerns: “You can’t get tested!” Benjamin said. “It would’ve been an interesting component of it, but you can’t get tests. People are lining up for hours to get tests.” Advertisement     “I don’t know who to blame, but what I can say is we need to focus a hell of a lot more on testing, and that’s something we as a nation have not done well in,” he added. “I don’t know what the holdup is.”
 


The Biden administration has said it plans to send half a billion rapid COVID tests to Americans to try to meet the new demand, but those may take weeks to arrive, offering little help to people currently in isolation who may be struggling to get their hands on one.Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, called the new guidelines “quite reasonable” but said that he too would have included a negative test as an exit requirement, as well as a recommendation for everyone to use better-quality masks, such as N95s.“Do I wish they had added testing, better mask guidance, etc?” he wrote on Twitter. “Yup. But still a step in the right direction.”Bob Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News that his preference would have been for the new guidance to only apply to vaccinated people and that negative tests be required on days four and five of the isolation period. But, he said, that could only exist “in a perfect world.” Advertisement     “In the real world, shorting the isolation time is critical if we’re going to keep hospitals, airlines, and other essential services open, given the skyrocketing cases of Omicron,” Wachter said. “A testing requirement would have been impossible to operationalize given the shortage of tests, and a vaccine requirement would have been difficult to enforce.”He added, “I think that the net benefit to society of bringing people back to work on Day 6 — assuming they mask on Days 6-10, as they’re supposed to — will exceed a relatively small number of infections caused by this strategy, particularly since Omicron is proving to be significantly less severe than prior variants.”Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner who now sits on the board of Pfizer, told the Washington Post that the updated CDC guidance marked a new point in the pandemic.“The new guidance reflects a growing reality that we’re going to have to learn to live with COVID as a persistent risk, and can’t let it shut down society,” Gottlieb said.Benjamin said that as the world enters the third year of the pandemic, officials need to meet the moment with clear, calming communications, especially about the extremely low risk COVID poses to people who have had all their recommended vaccines.“We need to come to a consensus — not just as a nation, but as a planet — as to what the new normal looks like,” he said, “and how we live as this matures to a more endemic version.” Advertisement

A key FBI informant in the Michigan kidnapping case has been charged with fraud, adding to the potential complications facing prosecutors in the high-profile domestic terrorism case.The informant, Stephen Robeson, was charged last week in Sauk County, Wisconsin, with defrauding a couple out of an SUV by convincing them to donate it to an anti–child sex trafficking charity that did not exist, according to the criminal complaint. His wife, Kimberly Robeson, was also charged. Both face up to three and a half years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000 if convicted. Advertisement     Robeson, who has multiple felony convictions and lives in Wisconsin, played a central role in building the criminal case against the alleged domestic terrorists accused in October 2020 of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The investigation resulted in six men being charged in federal court with plotting the kidnapping and eight other men in Michigan state court with providing material assistance to terrorism. Court records and interviews reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Robeson, working at the FBI’s behest, recruited potential targets, organized meetings during which suspects were secretly recorded, and paid expenses for people to attend those events.But just over four months after the takedown, prosecutors made the highly unusual move of indicting their own informant and charging him in federal court with illegally possessing a firearm, a .50-caliber sniper rifle he bought from an acquaintance from church just two weeks before the arrests in Michigan. Robeson eventually pleaded guilty in a deal that offered him time served and two years probation, an unusually light sentence that was far below sentencing guidelines for a recidivist felon.The new criminal accusation against Robeson comes in state court and is not related to his federal gun charge. But like the federal indictment, it makes claims of illegal conduct even as he was still deeply involved in the Michigan probe and under the supervision of FBI handlers. According to the criminal complaint, he convinced a couple to purchase a used 2003 Chevy Tahoe and donate it under false pretenses to an organization he ran called “Race to Unite Races” that “helps combat child sex trafficking in Sauk County.”An investigation by the Sauk County sheriff showed that despite Robeson’s claims to the contrary, the group “has never been registered as tax exempt or a 501c (nonprofit) organization by the IRS.” According to the complaint, the SUV was signed over to Race to Unite Races on Sept. 3, 2020 — nine days before Robeson participated in a nighttime surveillance of Whitmer’s lakeside vacation home. Advertisement     A federal trial in the kidnapping case is scheduled to begin on March 8. Last week, prosecutors confirmed they would not be calling on three FBI agents at the center of the investigation to testify after one was charged with domestic violence and fired, a second was accused of perjury in a prior case, and a third was discovered to have incorporated a security business linked to an online troll.Despite claims by the Justice Department that the issues with the agents were “irrelevant” to the case designed to “distract the jury,” defense attorneys have leaped on them as a part of their strategy to argue that their clients were entrapped by an FBI willing to overlook misbehavior by its own operatives in order to make a case at all costs.Robeson’s criminal activities are likely to figure heavily in that tactic, and defense attorneys have said they hope to call him as a witness during the trial. On Saturday, lawyers for the federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that “government agents and informants concocted, hatched, and pushed this ‘kidnapping plan’ from the beginning.”Robeson has not entered a plea in Sauk County court, records show. Joseph Bugni, an attorney for Robeson who negotiated his plea deal in federal court, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Grand Rapids also declined to comment, citing a government policy not to comment on ongoing criminal matters. The charge was first reported by the Baraboo News Republic. Advertisement     Documents filed in federal court last week by defense attorneys include numerous transcriptions of audio recordings, text messages, and encrypted chats between Robeson, other confidential informants, and defendants in the case, including recordings made on the night of the surveillance. The attorneys claim they show Robeson and another informant were “in charge of planning and organizing"" the event, rather than the defendants. Prosecutors, meanwhile, contend they have evidence showing the men were predisposed to commit the crimes and thus were not entrapped.Other messages and transcriptions highlighted by defense attorneys appear to show that Robeson, while working with the FBI, offered financial support to the targets of the investigation through a charity he controlled. “Its [sic] all tax writeoffs the way we do it for anybody that does it,” a recording allegedly made by Robeson on Sept. 12, 2020, said. “And what we do is we created a 501(3)(c).” In separate recordings, another informant promises defendants credit cards that draw from Robeson’s charity.Robeson has been convicted of numerous crimes in Wisconsin since the early 1980s, including fraud and having sex with a minor. He has been under investigation by the Sauk County sheriff since late October 2020 and was questioned in July, court records show.Under the terms of his bond in the federal case, Robeson is required to notify his probation officer of any contact with law enforcement, but he has failed to do so, according to a filing in federal court last month, putting his plea deal on the gun charge at risk.

The family of a 14-year-old girl who was shot and killed by a stray bullet fired by a Los Angeles Police Department officer while she was in a dressing room said they want justice for their daughter.Valentina Orellana Peralta was killed while shopping with her mother at a North Hollywood Burlington Coat Factory on Thursday, the day before Christmas Eve, when a man armed with what appeared to be a bike lock began attacking customers. Chaos erupted in the store. Employees and witnesses called 911 to report the crime, but due to the panic and confusion inside the store, police arrived on the scene believing that the man was likely carrying a firearm, the LAPD said. When officers arrived, they shot and killed the man, identified by police as Daniel Elena Lopez, 24. Advertisement     However, one of the bullets that officers fired at Elena Lopez pierced the dressing room door where Valentina and her mother were sheltering in place. She died in her mom's arms.""We heard some screams and sat down and hugged and started crying,"" Valentina's mother, Soledad Peralta, said in a statement translated from Spanish to English during a press conference Tuesday. “Valentina went to lock the door to protect us. We started hugging each other tighter. We were praying. I was praying for her, and I believe she was praying for me.""Suddenly, Soledad said, something hit Valentina with a strong enough force to throw her and her daughter to the ground.""I saw white powder coming out of Valentina's body and she began to go through convulsions. Her body went limp. I tried to wake her up by shaking her,"" Soledad said. ""She died in my arms and there was nothing I could do. To see a son or daughter die in your arms is one of the greatest and most profound pains that any human being can imagine."" Advertisement     Soledad said that police did not respond to her screams for help until after her daughter was dead.""When the police finally came, they took me out of the dressing room and left my daughter laying there. I wanted them to help her, but they just left her laying there alone,"" she said.
 


Police Chief Michel R. Moore issued a statement addressing the shooting on Friday in which he promised an extensive investigation.“This chaotic incident resulting in the death of an innocent child is tragic and devastating for everyone involved,"" he said. ""I am profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl’s life and I know there are no words that can relieve the unimaginable pain for the family.""Moore said the department will conduct a ""thorough, complete and transparent investigation into the circumstances that led up to this tragedy and provide the family and public with as much information as possible."" Advertisement     In addition to the LAPD's review, the California Department of Justice is conducting an independent investigation into the shooting.On Monday night, the LAPD released a 35-minute video of 911 call recordings and edited surveillance and body camera footage of the events leading up to the shooting and its aftermath.Although Valentina cannot be seen in the video, her mother's scream can be heard after the shooting stopped.
 


In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Valentina's aunt Carolina Peralta said that her niece and sister came to California from their home country of Chile approximately six months ago.She said that Valentina's sister was working in a local restaurant and they traveled to the US to visit her. The trip turned into a longer stay, she told the LA Times, and mother and daughter had begun the immigration process in order to live in the country permanently.""Valentina was a shy girl in Chile, but everything was turning out well for her in the US,"" Carolina Peralta said. ""She was catching up with English and being more outgoing. She was happy to be with her older sister."" Advertisement     ""[Soledad] does not understand how this tragedy could have happened just when they had managed to reunite the family,"" she said.During Tuesday's press conference, lawyers for the family did not announce any legal proceedings but said that they were considering all possible options, including a possible civil lawsuit.""We want justice for our angel. Our precious little angel, Valentina,"" Soledad said.Ben Crump, one of the attorneys representing the family, said the family wanted people to know that Valentina was ""beautiful, intelligent, and had the whole world ahead of her.""He also read out loud a statement from her dad, Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, who had traveled to Los Angeles from Chile. He said his daughter once described the US as ""the safest country in the world.""""It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,"" the father's statement said. ""She had dreams, and tragically those dreams have been overshadowed by this nightmare that has prevented me from sleeping at night.""

No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.”It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate. Advertisement  But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future.
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day.Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted. Advertisement  “It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital.“He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3. Advertisement  Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey.“The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded. Advertisement  “It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes.Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.” Advertisement  
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking.That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything. Advertisement     “I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.”Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.” Advertisement     Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida.“I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it. Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of the time of publication. Advertisement  
 


AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.” Advertisement  To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement  When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes. Advertisement  
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

If any modern scientist can claim to have carried the torch lit by Charles Darwin, it was Edward Osborne Wilson — usually known as ""E.O.""Wilson pioneered the study of biological diversity, adding a theoretical dimension to nature conservation — which had previously seemed more like a moral crusade than a scientific endeavor.  Advertisement     He popularized the term ""sociobiology,"" exploring evolutionary explanations of social behavior. And he turned it all into lucid prose, becoming one of the most effective science communicators of his time.Wilson died on Sunday in Burlington, Massachusetts, according to a statement from the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.Like Darwin, Wilson stirred up a hornet's nest with his evolutionary theories. But in Wilson's case, the most violent attacks against him came not from religious opponents, but from fellow scientists. After the publication of his 1975 book Sociobiology, Wilson was pilloried by the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, who accused him of justifying eugenics, sexism, and rampant capitalism. But Wilson gave as good as he got, and emerged from the battle with his reputation intact. Advertisement     
 


Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929, Wilson might have studied birds or mammals if not for an accident at the age of 7.


After piercing his right eye with a fishing hook, he didn't seek treatment and later had to have the lens removed. The accident left Wilson with poor distance vision, as he recounts in his 1994 autobiography, Naturalist. But his left eye remained sharp, leading him to focus on what he called ""the little things.""  Advertisement     Ants became his life's work — and led to his interest in biodiversity and the evolution of social behavior. As a Harvard fellow in the early 1950s, he traveled to Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific, marveling at the diversity of the ants he observed and speculating on how they could have evolved.Back at Harvard, where he spent his entire career, these thoughts eventually coalesced into The Theory of Island Biogeography, a 1967 book written with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur. Wilson and MacArthur explored how species diverge into new forms on islands, and showed how their risk of extinction is highest if those islands — which can be patches of natural habitat in a human-altered landscape — are small. This idea still dominates the thinking of conservationists, as they strive to expand and connect fragments of remaining habitat to give wildlife a fighting chance of survival.
 


Ants are not only incredibly diverse, but they also boast some of the most complex societies in the animal kingdom.


Ant colonies with thousands of individuals work together to raise the young of a single queen. This had long posed a problem for Darwinian theory: In a natural world dominated by the struggle to survive and reproduce, why would female workers in social insect species have evolved to be sterile? Advertisement     In 1964, the British biologist Bill Hamilton came up with an answer. He argued that evolution is really about the reproduction and survival of genes, rather than individuals. So a gene can spread if it causes behavior that favors copies of itself in an animal's relatives. This ""kin selection"" theory made sense as an explanation for insect societies, because sister ants and bees — thanks to a quirk of their genetics — share 75% of their genes by descent, rather than the usual 50%.Hamilton was a great theorist, but a poor communicator. Wilson packaged the idea for wider consumption and united it with other work explaining the evolution of behavior. The final chapter of Sociobiology briefly discussed these ideas in the context of human society — too briefly, Wilson later admitted.""I should have been more politically careful, by saying this does not imply racism, it does not imply sexism,"" Wilson told the Harvard Gazette in 2011.The chapter enraged left-leaning academics led by his Harvard colleagues Gould and Lewontin, who published a blistering assault in the New York Review of Books invoking the horrors of Nazi Germany. Wilson was aghast, but fought back hard, accusing his critics of misrepresenting his positions. Wilson followed up in 1979 with On Human Nature, which dealt with the evolution of human behavior in more depth, and won the first of his Pulitzer prizes. (The second was for The Ants, published in 1991 with fellow ant guru Bert Hölldobler.) Advertisement     
 


Wilson's interest in human nature also led him to ponder the centrality of religious belief in human societies.


He lost his Baptist faith in his teens, but in his later years tried to find common ground with evangelical Christians in preserving what they view as divine creation and what he called the ""evolutionary epic.""Wilson didn't shy away from conflict. He spent the last few years of his life at odds with many evolutionary biologists after he rejected Hamilton's kin selection theory in a controversial 2010 paper published in Nature. The paper argued that kin selection had little value as a general explanation of sociality, and described insect colonies as ""superorganisms.""This echoed an old idea called ""group selection,"" which argued that social behavior can evolve because it benefits a group of animals, improving their survival over rival groups. In the gene-centric era, this had become a discredited theory. For the author of Sociobiology to embrace it, while rejecting kin selection, stunned his peers.In a subsequent issue of Nature, 137 leading evolutionary biologists signed a letter denouncing Wilson's about-turn. And in a later article in Prospect magazine, Richard Dawkins of Oxford University added: ""For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is — it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero — an act of wanton arrogance.""Arrogance, or supreme intellectual confidence? History, and the relentless struggle between competing scientific ideas, will be the judge.

Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner Advertisement  
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

199,"The CDC’s updated isolation guidance took people by surprise, including some experts.","


As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.”Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia. Advertisement  “I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.”
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.”“I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.”Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.” Advertisement  
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

The CDC is shortening the length of isolation time recommended for people with COVID-19, cutting it from 10 days to five, the organization announced Monday.If a person is asymptomatic at the end of the five days, they may end their isolation. The new recommendations also say they should continue to wear a mask for another five days when around other people. Advertisement     ""The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,"" the CDC explained in a statement.The guidance around quarantining after exposure is also changing. Previously, the CDC said fully vaccinated people did not have to quarantine if exposed to COVID-19. But in their Monday announcement, the organization said that would now only apply to people who have received their booster shot.A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is now recommended following exposure to the virus for anyone who is unvaccinated, more than six months out from their last vaccine dose, or more than two months out from getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine without a booster.If the exposed person is unable to quarantine, it is recommended they wear a mask for 10 days when in the presence of others.But even people who have gotten their booster shot should still exercise caution following exposure to the virus. Though they don’t have to quarantine, the CDC said they should still wear a mask for 10 days following the exposure. Advertisement     Regardless of vaccine status, the CDC recommends people get tested for COVID-19 five days after being exposed.The new recommendations come as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has become the dominant strain in the US.“The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said in a statement on Monday. ""CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses.""Walensky said the updated guidance should ""ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.""""Prevention is our best option,"" she said. ""Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.”

If any modern scientist can claim to have carried the torch lit by Charles Darwin, it was Edward Osborne Wilson — usually known as ""E.O.""Wilson pioneered the study of biological diversity, adding a theoretical dimension to nature conservation — which had previously seemed more like a moral crusade than a scientific endeavor.  Advertisement     He popularized the term ""sociobiology,"" exploring evolutionary explanations of social behavior. And he turned it all into lucid prose, becoming one of the most effective science communicators of his time.Wilson died on Sunday in Burlington, Massachusetts, according to a statement from the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.Like Darwin, Wilson stirred up a hornet's nest with his evolutionary theories. But in Wilson's case, the most violent attacks against him came not from religious opponents, but from fellow scientists. After the publication of his 1975 book Sociobiology, Wilson was pilloried by the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, who accused him of justifying eugenics, sexism, and rampant capitalism. But Wilson gave as good as he got, and emerged from the battle with his reputation intact. Advertisement     
 


Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929, Wilson might have studied birds or mammals if not for an accident at the age of 7.


After piercing his right eye with a fishing hook, he didn't seek treatment and later had to have the lens removed. The accident left Wilson with poor distance vision, as he recounts in his 1994 autobiography, Naturalist. But his left eye remained sharp, leading him to focus on what he called ""the little things.""  Advertisement     Ants became his life's work — and led to his interest in biodiversity and the evolution of social behavior. As a Harvard fellow in the early 1950s, he traveled to Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific, marveling at the diversity of the ants he observed and speculating on how they could have evolved.Back at Harvard, where he spent his entire career, these thoughts eventually coalesced into The Theory of Island Biogeography, a 1967 book written with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur. Wilson and MacArthur explored how species diverge into new forms on islands, and showed how their risk of extinction is highest if those islands — which can be patches of natural habitat in a human-altered landscape — are small. This idea still dominates the thinking of conservationists, as they strive to expand and connect fragments of remaining habitat to give wildlife a fighting chance of survival.
 


Ants are not only incredibly diverse, but they also boast some of the most complex societies in the animal kingdom.


Ant colonies with thousands of individuals work together to raise the young of a single queen. This had long posed a problem for Darwinian theory: In a natural world dominated by the struggle to survive and reproduce, why would female workers in social insect species have evolved to be sterile? Advertisement     In 1964, the British biologist Bill Hamilton came up with an answer. He argued that evolution is really about the reproduction and survival of genes, rather than individuals. So a gene can spread if it causes behavior that favors copies of itself in an animal's relatives. This ""kin selection"" theory made sense as an explanation for insect societies, because sister ants and bees — thanks to a quirk of their genetics — share 75% of their genes by descent, rather than the usual 50%.Hamilton was a great theorist, but a poor communicator. Wilson packaged the idea for wider consumption and united it with other work explaining the evolution of behavior. The final chapter of Sociobiology briefly discussed these ideas in the context of human society — too briefly, Wilson later admitted.""I should have been more politically careful, by saying this does not imply racism, it does not imply sexism,"" Wilson told the Harvard Gazette in 2011.The chapter enraged left-leaning academics led by his Harvard colleagues Gould and Lewontin, who published a blistering assault in the New York Review of Books invoking the horrors of Nazi Germany. Wilson was aghast, but fought back hard, accusing his critics of misrepresenting his positions. Wilson followed up in 1979 with On Human Nature, which dealt with the evolution of human behavior in more depth, and won the first of his Pulitzer prizes. (The second was for The Ants, published in 1991 with fellow ant guru Bert Hölldobler.) Advertisement     
 


Wilson's interest in human nature also led him to ponder the centrality of religious belief in human societies.


He lost his Baptist faith in his teens, but in his later years tried to find common ground with evangelical Christians in preserving what they view as divine creation and what he called the ""evolutionary epic.""Wilson didn't shy away from conflict. He spent the last few years of his life at odds with many evolutionary biologists after he rejected Hamilton's kin selection theory in a controversial 2010 paper published in Nature. The paper argued that kin selection had little value as a general explanation of sociality, and described insect colonies as ""superorganisms.""This echoed an old idea called ""group selection,"" which argued that social behavior can evolve because it benefits a group of animals, improving their survival over rival groups. In the gene-centric era, this had become a discredited theory. For the author of Sociobiology to embrace it, while rejecting kin selection, stunned his peers.In a subsequent issue of Nature, 137 leading evolutionary biologists signed a letter denouncing Wilson's about-turn. And in a later article in Prospect magazine, Richard Dawkins of Oxford University added: ""For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is — it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero — an act of wanton arrogance.""Arrogance, or supreme intellectual confidence? History, and the relentless struggle between competing scientific ideas, will be the judge.

Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner Advertisement  
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

203,"The climate crisis is here, the US is woefully unprepared, and people are already paying with their lives.","


A UK newspaper was forced to print an admission that it had violated the rights of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on Sunday after losing a privacy and copyright infringement lawsuit.The court-mandated apology and an unspecified amount of money in financial reparations mark the end of a multiyear legal battle between Meghan and Associated Newspapers Limited, the parent company of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online. The duchess sued ANL in October 2019 for violating her privacy and copyright rights after the company published excerpts from a handwritten letter she sent her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in the Mail on Sunday and in a number of stories published on Mail Online. Advertisement     ""Following a hearing on 19-20 January, 2021, and a further hearing on 5 May, 2021, the Court has given judgment for the Duchess of Sussex on her claim for copyright infringement,"" the statement said. ""The Court found that Associated Newspapers infringed her copyright by publishing extracts of her handwritten letters to her father in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online. Financial remedies have been agreed.""On Feb. 11, High Court Lord Justice Mark Warby ruled in Meghan's favor in a summary judgment, a type of verdict granted when a judge determines that no trial is needed because the evidence is so overwhelming. In his decision, Warby wrote that “there is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.""ANL's lawyers appealed the ruling, claiming that Warby was wrong to award Meghan victory via summary judgment and arguing for the right to present their case at trial — something the duchess has fought against from the beginning of the proceedings.""To permit the defense to go to trial would only have facilitated further invasions of [Meghan's] privacy,"" her lawyers wrote to the UK Court of Appeal in November. Meghan's legal team accused ANL of pushing for a trial because it would give the tabloid company ""the opportunity to profit handsomely from the media circus that would inevitably result."" Advertisement     During the appeal proceedings in November, lawyers for ANL argued that Warby made his judgment without knowing all of the information — and presented new evidence in the form of written testimony from the Sussexes’ former communications secretary Jason Knauf that showed inconsistencies in Meghan's statements to the court about the letter and her expectations of privacy.According to Knauf, Meghan composed the letter knowing that her father might give it to the press. And although Meghan swore under oath that she never coordinated with members of the media to share private information, Knauf provided the court with emails between himself and the duchess discussing what she wanted him to say in a secret briefing with two reporters who were writing what proved to be a very sympathetic biography of the Sussexes. In response to Knauf's revelations, in a witness statement filed Nov. 11, Meghan apologized to the court “for the fact that [she] had not remembered these exchanges"" and swore she “had no intention to mislead the defendant or the court.”However, the fact that Meghan — intentionally or unintentionally — was not entirely truthful ultimately had no effect on the Court of Appeal, which ruled in her favor in a judgment issued Dec. 2.
 


Although ANL said in a post-verdict statement that it was considering appealing the case to the UK Supreme Court, its publication of the apology Sunday signaled that the company has finally admitted defeat.
 


As part of his initial judgment in Meghan's favor in February, Warby ordered ANL to publish a statement in print and online that acknowledged the company violated the duchess's copyright rights. According to UK law, ""Where the court finds that an intellectual property right has been infringed, the court may, at the request of the applicant, order appropriate measures for the dissemination and publication of the judgment to be taken at the expense of the infringer.""As can be seen in an order filed by Warby on March 22, the wording and format of ANL's statement was a source of contention — down to the font size in which the text would be printed and how long the statement would remain on Mail Online's website.The agreed-upon text was published Sunday on the third page of the newspaper, with a statement on the front page directing readers to it.The same text, with links to the court's judgments, is currently on display on Mail Online's homepage and will be for the next week. (Many commentators pointed out that ANL chose to carry out the court order the day after Christmas, a day when few people typically read newspapers.)
 


In a statement issued in response to the Court of Appeal's ruling in her favor on Dec. 2, Meghan said that her win was not just for her but ""for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what's right.""""While this win is precedent setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create.""From day one, I have treated this lawsuit as an important measure of right versus wrong. The defendant has treated it as a game with no rules. The longer they dragged it out, the more they could twist facts and manipulate the public (even during the appeal itself), making a straightforward case extraordinarily convoluted in order to generate more headlines and sell more newspapers — a model that rewards chaos above truth,"" she said.""Because as far removed as it may seem from your personal life, it’s not. Tomorrow it could be you. These harmful practices don’t happen once in a blue moon — they are a daily fail that divide us, and we all deserve better.""

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O.
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well. Advertisement     Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O. Advertisement     
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M. Advertisement     
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

205,Here are some of the best gadgets that you can spend that Christmas cash on,"


If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

207,"He put nature conservation on a scientific footing, battled colleagues who were enraged by his biological explanations of human behavior, and won two Pulitzer prizes — all inspired by ants.","


Desmond Tutu, the globally revered South African Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate who played a key role in the country’s struggle against apartheid, has died at age 90.He died Sunday in Cape Town, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said. In a statement, the president praised the intellect, compassion, and leadership of the man affectionately known as ""the Arch."" Advertisement     ""From the pavements of resistance in South Africa to the pulpits of the world’s great cathedrals and places of worship, and the prestigious setting of the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, the Arch distinguished himself as a nonsectarian, inclusive champion of universal human rights,"" Ramaphosa said.The popular Tutu, known for his unwaveringly cheerful disposition, became widely regarded as “South Africa’s moral conscience” during his tireless campaign against the country’s apartheid regime during the long years of Nelson Mandela’s incarceration.As the late Mandela himself said, Tutu was “sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid, and seldom without humor.” Tutu received the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent anti-apartheid campaigning in 1984.
 


Tutu was born in the tiny gold-mining town of Klerksdorp in Transvaal — now in South Africa’s North West province. His mother was a cleaner and cook in a school for the blind, and his father was a teacher, a profession he would eventually enter himself.After three years teaching in high school, he became dismayed at the 1953 Bantu Education Act — which enforced racial segregation in all South African educational establishments — and began studying theology.
 


Tutu had been inspired by the church from an early age. He saw the white priest Trevor Huddleston working as parish priest for the Black Johannesburg slum of Sophiatown when he was 12.“One day, I was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in priest’s clothing walked past. As he passed us, he took off his hat to my mother. I couldn’t believe my eyes — a white man who greeted a Black working-class woman!” he said.This first encounter with Huddleston had a lasting effect on Tutu. When asked in his later years about why he doesn’t hate white people, he would usually respond that he was fortunate with the white people he met while he was young.Tutu was ordained as a priest in 1960, and from 1962 to 1966, he continued his theological studies in the United Kingdom, where he received his master’s degree in theology. He returned to South Africa in 1967 and taught theology in his home country until 1972, when he returned to England to serve as the assistant director of a theological institute in London for three years.He became the first Black Anglican dean of Johannesburg in 1975, and then the bishop of the Diocese of Lesotho in 1976.
 


While he was already a powerful figure within the church, it was the 1976 uprising in Soweto and other Black townships — during which hundreds of people were killed — that saw him catapulted into the consciousness of white South Africans as a campaigner for reform.He unflinchingly pushed nonviolent protest as the best means to further the anti-apartheid cause, and his outspoken campaigning inevitably led to his presence being felt more and more in the political arena. Tutu always insisted his motivation was religious rather than political, arguing that the racist apartheid system was against God’s will.In 1984, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Prize for his “role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa,” an award that sent a strong message from the international community to P.W. Botha’s regime.He gained further attention for his peaceful methods in 1986 when he intervened in the streets of Duduza after a crowd of angry Black people turned on a man they said was a collaborator with the white-minority regime.The man’s car had been set on fire “to provide his funeral pyre.” Tutu, dressed in his robes after officiating a funeral, confronted the mob, telling them their behavior “undermines the struggle,” the New York Times reported.
 


In 1986, his status grew further when he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town, meaning he became the first Black person to lead the Anglican Church in South Africa.He continued his active anti-apartheid campaign in his new role and declared in March 1988, “We refuse to be treated as the doormat for the government to wipe its jackboots on.”Later in 1988, he put himself at risk of being thrown in jail by publicly calling for a boycott of municipal elections. He welcomed the liberalizing reforms announced by new president F.W. de Klerk when he assumed office the following year, which included a lifting of the ban on the African National Congress and the long-awaited release of Nelson Mandela.
 


Mandela was freed in 1990 after 27 years of incarceration, mostly in the notorious Robben Island Prison, and Tutu stood side by side with him in front of cheering crowds at Cape Town’s City Hall only hours after he had left prison.After the end of apartheid, Mandela became South Africa’s first Black chief executive in 1994, and his administration appointed Tutu chair of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Despite saying he was “appalled at the evil we have uncovered” at times during his tenure, Tutu modeled the commission on using truth as the foundation for forgiveness, and believed this was central to healing the rifts in South African society: “Without forgiveness, there can be no future for a relationship between individuals or within and between nations,” he said.He retired from his role at the commission in 1998 and shared his experience of reconciliation processes with other post-conflict or divided societies, including Northern Ireland, the Solomon Islands, and Cyprus.
 


He became a founding member of the Elders — a group of senior global leaders, who have included Mandela, Kofi Annan, and Jimmy Carter, working together for the advancement of peace and human rights — in 2007. He chaired the group for six years, stepping down in 2013.As he grew older, Tutu continued to speak out wherever he saw injustice in the world. In 2008, he called on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to step down or be removed by force, saying, “He has destroyed a wonderful country. A country that used to be a bread basket — it has now become a basket case.”
 


He also refused to share a platform with Tony Blair in 2012 because of the Iraq War, saying the “then-leaders of the US and UK fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart.”Tutu also said the Israeli blockades of the Gaza Strip were an “abomination,” and compared the country’s policies toward Palestinians to apartheid.He announced his phased retirement from public life in 2011 at the age of 79.In spite of seeing so much injustice in the world throughout his life, Tutu always maintained a positive outlook and maintained his faith in the good of humanity. In 2014, he said, “Despite all of the ghastliness in the world, human beings are made for goodness. The ones that are held in high regard are not militarily powerful, nor even economically prosperous. They have a commitment to try and make the world a better place.”

209,These are the life hacks that we're *definitely* taking with us into 2022,"


Even though it feels like June was literally yesterday, it’s that time of year again. Many Americans are gearing up for a holiday season that is going to range from slightly untraditional to downright devastating. During this time, some of us might be looking for some comfort — some old-fashioned, otherworldly cheer. Thankfully, Danelle Manthey’s new book, American Christmas, has this in droves.Manthey, a New York–based photographer, picked up her first camera at age 16, but it wasn’t until years later that her interest in photographing fantastical Christmas displays turned into an obsession that would take her around the country — to 12 states — and last over a decade. We spoke to her about her new book and what she thinks Christmas displays will look like this year.For more photo news to get you through the holidays, sign up for our newsletter below.
 


Did you grow up in a ""Christmas"" family?My family celebrated Christmas and had the same fake Christmas tree every year. We didn’t go all out with decorations or decorate the outside of our house, but we loved to drive around my hometown, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, looking at Christmas lights. It was our annual tradition. Every year, the local paper has a map of the local light displays. The streets have clever names, like Candy Cane Lane, Church Lane, and Penguin Lane, and all of the houses on a street are decorated according to the theme.How did you find the first folks that you photographed?The first year I worked on the project, I wrote a note introducing myself and asking to take pictures of people with their light displays. My dad and niece went around to houses in Sioux Falls that they thought were the best and left the note in people’s doors and mailboxes. Some of those people contacted me, and I scheduled appointments to take their photos. Advertisement  What surprised you about people's personal inspiration for these decorations?So many folks have very deeply heartfelt reasons for decorating. For example, memories of childhood are often transformed into big public displays. Many people have charities that they donate to in conjunction with their Christmas lights, and that is really a great way to show the giving aspect of the season instead of the commercialization of Christmas.
 


You call these displays a unique form of American folk art. Could you elaborate on that?First, let's look at the definition of folk art: artistic works, as paintings, sculpture, basketry, and utensils, produced typically in cultural isolation by untrained, often anonymous artists or by artisans of varying degrees of skill and marked by such attributes as highly decorative design, bright, bold colors, flattened perspective, strong forms in simple arrangements, and immediacy of meaning. Advertisement  If we look at this definition alone, I think it clearly shows that decorating would be in this vein. The people that decorate in most situations are untrained as artists and wouldn’t consider themselves to be artists at all. One could certainly call Christmas decorations “highly decorated design with bright, bold colors.” And then we get immediacy of meaning or without and distortions of meaning. I think we can clearly say that there are not any distortions of meaning within these decorations — they are what they are: a celebration of the season. There is no ulterior motivation than to spread joy to the community.When you look at those factors, I think it’s quite clear that this — along with this level of holiday decoration being a VERY American phenomenon — is a form of folk art.
 


Are there any decorators who really stand out?I’m pretty attached to every house and person I photographed, but here are some highlights:Petey from Hammond, Indiana. Hammond is the town that is depicted in the movie A Christmas Story, and they have a leg lamp in the window to pay homage to it.Gil Gerard from Louisiana hand-built a trolley car replica like the one that runs down St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans and a paddle boat that sails the Mississippi River.Deacon Dave in Livermore, California, has amazing decorations both inside and out of his “House of the Dove.” The exterior of his home has a canopy of lights that is incredible to walk underneath. He also has a private chapel on the back of his property.And lastly, the book starts with Jim Mortensen from Windsor, California, who transforms the outside of his house into a gingerbread house by wrapping it in brown plastic with candy cane trim and a large cuckoo clock over the garage.
 


Do you see the displays changing this year, with the pandemic?Some people will not be doing their displays because of the pandemic. But I think there may be more Christmas displays this year because people are longing for this coziness, this togetherness — it seems like this year people will be reaching out to see these kinds of displays more.What was, if anything, something truly interesting about the holiday that you learned over the process of making the book?To me, Christmas has never been my favorite holiday. Always a bit too commercial and centered around gifts. This project was a way for me to take back the holiday and spend it with people who transformed it into a community event that’s about giving.

There are many things that can help you get out of a funk.Exercise. Eating well. Getting enough sleep.Watching 42 cheesy holiday romance movies in a row.OK, I’m exaggerating with that last one.It’s more like 29 in a row.All holiday romance movies have the same formula. You take one pretty, thin, usually white woman with perpetually wavy hair and ever-present makeup (even when she’s just gotten out of bed). Give her a Very Important and Real job in the big city — something like an architect or interior designer or personal shopper or generic executive. Add too many work hours and a boyfriend who won’t commit. Advertisement  Now remove her from the big city and place her in the small town she grew up in but has been too afraid to go back to for emotional reasons — preferably related to the death of a parent, because at least one parent must always be dead.And then here comes the crucial ingredient: one tall, handsome, rugged-but-not-too-rugged man, usually clad in flannel, and almost definitely also white. Give him a sad-but-not-too-sad backstory — again, dead parents are preferable — and perhaps he also lived in the big city once before as well, but he’s grown tired of it and now fully embraces the wholesome charms of a small town life.Throw these two shiny, pretty people together in a meet-cute. Maybe they literally bump into each other or attempt to buy the same Christmas ornament or become competitors in a holiday baking competition. It’s crucial that they hate each other at first, but also that they secretly want to bone each other — or they would, if boning were allowed in the strictly PG-rated world of holiday romance.Keep putting them in cute scenarios like tree-decorating, ice-skating, sleigh-riding, snowman-building, and most of all cookie-baking. The formula is pretty much done when they happen to find themselves underneath the mistletoe, and they kiss, and then there’s a misunderstanding, but it’s cleared up within 10 minutes and we get one more kiss before everyone lives happily ever after and, even more importantly, has a very merry Christmas.
 


I’ve just described the exact plot of literally dozens of holiday romances. Hallmark, Lifetime, and now even Netflix churn them out every year in increasing volumes, always with the same basic plot and varying degrees of quality (by which I mean that there are occasional gems among a plethora of very, very bad movies).Sometimes the formula changes slightly — maybe the pretty white woman has been overlooked for her dream job and the handsome white man helps her get there, or perhaps instead of being blonde, she’s brunette — but the core ingredients are always the same. Even the titles and posters are virtually interchangeable, as though the movies’ designers just spun a giant wheel and picked whatever they landed on.To top it all off, the same pool of 12 stars is used for each movie. Lacey Chabert and Candace Cameron Bure are basically employed full-time by the holiday romance machine at this point.In short, every holiday rom-com is essentially the same.And that’s all part of the magic.
 


Contrary to what my current level of obsession with holiday romances might suggest, two years ago, I had never watched one.Two years ago, I was also in the deepest depression I’d experienced in a long time.It came on like a wave in mid-November. I had felt it creeping in bit by bit before that and had mostly been shoving it away to the back of my mind, pretending it wasn’t there and it wasn’t getting worse.Some days, I couldn’t get up at all.I couldn’t stop crying, except when I just didn’t have the energy to do so. I couldn’t sleep, except when I needed to be awake, and then it took everything I had to keep my eyes open.I couldn’t feel joy. I felt as though I never would again.I don’t remember exactly why or how or when it happened because, well, I was lost in a metaphorical mind fog, but somewhere in the midst of all this, I opened Netflix, which yelled at me the way it does, by blasting a trailer as soon as the app opens. “Watch A Christmas Prince!” it screamed. I guess, it’s not like anything matters, I thought.I hit play, and the weirdest thing happened. The movie was terrible. But it was also wonderful.Within a few minutes, I felt something bubbling in my chest. Something I hadn’t felt in weeks. A small spark of happiness. Soon it had grown enough that it actually burst from me in a smile, which became a laugh. I was actually laughing. Half an hour before that I’d been, to quote Anne Shirley (as I always try to do), in the depths of despair, and now I was laughing. Advertisement  Something about that ridiculous, gloriously silly movie worked a little miracle on me. For 92 minutes, I was happy, or something like it. I momentarily forgot about my worries — that is, they’d dwindled back down to their usual undercurrent churn instead of the tsunami they’d recently become.Naturally, I did the only thing any severely depressed person experiencing a brief reprieve would do. I rewatched A Christmas Prince.And then I rewatched it again.And then I discovered the big, wide, green-and-red-tinged world of holiday romances I’d been missing out on.Christmas Inheritance. Switched for Christmas. The Spirit of Christmas. My Christmas Love. Snowed-Inn Christmas. Snow Bride. Merry Kissmas.I slipped into the increasingly familiar world of each movie with eagerness and enthusiasm, feelings which were in themselves marvels.It’s not like these holiday romances instantly cured my depression. But they did give me hope.Spending that December watching one pair of pretty white people after another fall in love got me through to the new year. It gave me enough energy to begin the work it took to actually get better.
 


Here’s the thing about holiday romances: They are far (FAR) from perfect. They’re relentlessly corny, clichéd, and repetitive. They consistently reinforce outdated notions of what a woman can and should be, taking successful heroines who love their jobs and trapping them back in their hometowns, with Men Who Know Better. They’re aggressively heterosexual and blindingly white. There are exceptions to these problems, of course, but they’re too rare — especially when it comes to diversity.And yet these holiday romances are more popular than ever. Hallmark and Lifetime, the stalwarts of the genre, each started their holiday lineups in October this year. Yes, there were Christmas movies out before Halloween had even happened. And audiences watched them.Netflix, meanwhile — a newcomer in the genre, but one that has made an impact (hello, A Christmas Prince) — waited until Nov. 1 before it dropped its first holiday romance of the season.And it’s not just that the season for holiday romance is becoming longer — there’s also more content. This year, Hallmark produced 20% more Christmas movies than it did in 2017, while Lifetime is putting out four times as many holiday movies this year compared to two years ago. Networks like OWN and Freeform are dipping into the genre and releasing holiday romances of their own. All together, there are nearly 100 (!!) new holiday romances coming out in 2019. This is on top of the hundreds-deep back catalogues that the likes of Hallmark and Lifetime replay relentlessly in between premieres.The genre is a juggernaut that shows no signs of slowing down. The ratings are there. People eat these movies up. Women eat these movies up. Advertisement  
 


Many of my friends are, if not quite as obsessed with these holiday romances as I am, at least a little bit addicted to them. Like me, they’re busy and career-minded. They’re smart and opinionated and proudly feminist. And they enjoy slipping into these time-warped rom-coms as much as I do.The truth is a lot (but definitely not all) of the things that are “wrong” with holiday romances are actually part of the appeal. More diversity is vital, but the other problems — well, they’re actually the reason we turn to holiday romances.Rather than seeing tired clichés, these movies instead hold the promise of tropes we love: the kinds of storytelling devices and visual cues and plot points we’re very familiar with — so familiar that they’re like slipping into a warm, comforting blanket. The specifics of what that blanket looks like depend on the person; I personally go positively wild for anything involving fake dating and moments when the main characters have to share a hotel room (and even better, a bed, though that’s a bit too risqué for many a Hallmark and Lifetime product). The point is, the repetition doesn’t put us off — it’s why we watch.Of course the endings are predictable. That’s the best thing about the whole genre. Going into one of these movies, you know that within the next 90 minutes, two people are going to work through all their problems and fall in love and stay in love and everything will be OK in the end.The world is chaotic and scarier than ever, the news is exhausting, and you can’t even check Twitter for silly memes without being reminded that everything is quite literally on fire. But in the land of holiday romance, the biggest problems our heroines face are whether the gingerbread recipe is going to turn out right (it will) or if she’ll ever find the antique tree topper her grandfather gave her grandmother when they got married (she will).Even the regressiveness of some of the plotlines plays a part in their popularity. Millennial burnout is very real, and so it’s no surprise that the idea of escaping long work hours and hectic city life for less stress, more trees, and a bonus handsome guy or two is appealing. We might not actually want to live that life, but we enjoy indulging in the fantasy for a little while.The holidays are hard. They’re even harder when you’re depressed or anxious or lonely. Holiday romances pick up this uncomfortable truth and flip it around: Characters who find the holidays rough rediscover their joy in them, everyone who is lonely finds a perfect someone to give them comfort and companionship, and negative feelings, when they exist, are soothed away with a cup of hot cocoa and a kiss.The true magic of holiday romances is that they allow us to escape to a place that’s controlled and neat — the opposite of the real world.Which is pretty much the best holiday gift you could ask for. ●

I don’t like Christmas, because I don’t really like anything, so very few Christmas movies actually appeal to me. I was raised by grumpy, cynical Hindus, so we didn’t celebrate much beyond rerouting gifts from Diwali to Christmas Day — but trickier is that the positivity proselytizing in holiday movies has never spoken to me. Even now, Christmas feels like a lonely time, even though I’m perpetually surrounded by people who love this holiday and want me to, I don’t know, pretend I love mulled wine (ah, yes, warm cough syrup, ‘tis the season). Advertisement     So, naturally, A Charlie Brown Christmas is the one holiday movie that speaks to me the most. It’s moody and oddly macabre for children’s programming, and it’s only moderately treacly by the end. Christmas bums me out — this year, in particular, for reasons I don’t think I have to detail in full — so maybe there’s something soothing about seeing Charlie’s pathetic little tree (an allegory for me) or watching Lucy grow infuriated with Schroeder (also me, somehow). Christmas is hard! Why are we even pretending it’s not? At least with the Peanuts gang I don’t have to pretend I’m having a nice time, and I’m not the saddest person in the room.“I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus,” Charlie Brown tells his friend in the movie. “Christmas is coming, but I’m not happy. I don’t feel the way I’m supposed to feel.” Same here, buddy. The holidays are tough for outcasts, but it’s nice when you can find someone — or something — understanding of how you feel. —Scaachi KoulHow to watch: PBS, Apple+
 


One of my favorite pandemic activities has been revisiting films I enjoyed as a kid. I recently rewatched both Home Alone movies. Although they’re essentially the same in terms of plot, the sequel is so earnest — and so filled with the exact kind of merriment I’ve been craving in our year of perpetual sadness — that there were moments that made me genuinely weep. It’s billed as a comedy, and it’s led by the talented Macaulay Culkin, who masterfully nails the precocity of Kevin McCallister (has there ever been a better child actor?!), the kid whose feeling of being an outsider in his own family manifests when they, serendipitously, board two different flights for Christmas vacation, one headed to Miami and the other New York City.Kevin, alone in the big city, makes the most of the holiday that he now must celebrate by himself. There’s scamming; he cleverly uses his father’s credit card to check in at the Plaza Hotel, orders room service, and watches movies that definitely aren’t age-appropriate. There’s New York itself; Kevin soaks up the incredible view atop the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern star as the two bandits who haven’t quite mastered the art of outsmarting a 10-year-old boy are fantastic. The scene where Stern’s Marv is accidentally electrocuted — dangerous? Probably! HILARIOUS? ABSOLUTELY! And the John Williams score is beautiful. A little sappy, maybe, but a reminder that the love of family and friends is ultimately the reason this time of the year is so special. So if you want a massive dose of holiday cheer, get to streaming, ya filthy animal! —Michael BlackmonHow to watch: Disney+
 


There is no movie I’d rather watch while getting drunk on a plane — at any time of year — than The Family Stone. It’s the perfect plane movie, the perfect holiday movie. Just a perfect movie, period.Dermot Mulroney plays Everett, the requisite hard-hearted city dweller who’s returning home to the burbs for the holidays. This year, he’s bringing his girlfriend, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker, iconic as always), whose uptight work obsessiveness and tight bun alienate her from Everett’s upscale bohemian siblings. The more Meredith tries to endear herself to them, the cringier she gets. During an infamous dinner scene, she makes anti-gay comments about Everett’s gay brother, Thad (Tyrone Giordano), and it’s only their other brother, Ben (Luke Wilson, delightful as the Cali stoner), who takes pity on her.I know a lot of people who are turned off by the redemption plotline for this anti-gay loser of a woman — but for me, the scene is so much more about how angry their mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) gets at Meredith for implying there’s anything wrong with her son. (And this movie came out 15 years ago, mind you.) Diane Keaton as the Stone family’s matriarch is what I’m really here for, even more so than absurd romantic switch-ups and zany conflicts. As a lesbian with mommy issues, can you really blame me?? I cry at the end every single time. —Shannon KeatingHow to watch: Hulu, HBO Max
 


There are many iconic lines in this 2003 Christmas movie starring Will Ferrell as a human who grew up among elves in the North Pole and who must journey to New York to find his father. Like when Ferrell’s Buddy the Elf finds out he is not, in fact, a gargantuan elf, and that his father (James Caan) is on the naughty list. He runs through the snow in hysterics, and when his friends, a trio of stop-motion figures, say hello, he screams, “Not now, Arctic Puffin!” Or later, when he’s questioned about why he smiles so much: “I love smiling, smiling’s my favorite,” he says. Or when he answers his father’s business phone at a children’s book publisher with “Buddy the Elf, what’s your favorite color?”The movie, directed by Jon Favreau, is a journey of self-discovery (one that rivals that of any Greek hero) as Buddy goes in search of his father while also trying to spread Christmas cheer. There’s something truly magical about watching Ferrell play an eccentric adult dressed like an elf, creating havoc wherever he goes. Even if we are forced to watch this giant adult baby have a romantic plotline with Zooey Deschanel — who is both horribly miscast and blonde!! — whatever, I’ll take it all just to see Ferrell in yellow tights and an adorable little hat running through the streets of New York screaming “Santa!!!!” and putting discarded, already chewed gum into his mouth, even after Santa advises him that the gum he finds on the street is not “free candy.” —Karolina WaclawiakHow to watch: Hulu, Amazon Prime
 


The British candy-coated romantic comedy, which came out in 2003, is everything a good holiday movie should be: It has an unapologetically asinine plot with protagonists you root for that barrels into a completely unrealistic batshit ending — except you don’t care, because everything works out and makes you ugly-cry.Granted, as with all holiday movies, there are plot holes to navigate. Are there so many storylines in Love Actually that you feel like you’re watching four movies at once? Yes. Could the movie have done without the entirely stupid “Colin Goes to America to Have a Four-Way With British-Starved Women in Milwaukee” storyline? Absolutely. Was I incredibly frustrated that Sarah (Laura Linney) sabotaged a night of hot sex with her work crush, Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), by simply deciding not to tell him what was happening in her personal life? Mmmm, yes.Otherwise, Love Actually checks all the boxes. I know we were supposed to care more about way-too-self-aware Sam (Thomas Sangster) and his crush on his American classmate Joanna (Olivia Olson). But let’s be honest, the romance between Jamie (Colin Firth), who retreats to a French cottage after finding his wife in bed with his brother, and his non-English-speaking Portuguese housekeeper, Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz), is the crown jewel of the plot. Even if you think all the other plotlines suck ass, Jamie’s realization and subsequent journey back to Aurélia makes it all worth it.There are other endearing storylines: The friendship between rock legend Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) and his longtime manager, Joe (Gregor Fisher), is sweeter than you think it’ll be. As is the story of how the relationship between how actor stand-ins John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) develops after they simulate some very awkward sex scenes. Advertisement     But, as is the case with your other stupid holiday favorites, this isn’t a movie where we focus on what “should” have happened. Instead, we give ourselves over to the charm of the film. So stop coming for Love Actually and start enjoying it for what it is: A VERY GOOD HOLIDAY MOVIE. —Jason WellsHow to watch: Netflix, Amazon Prime
 


Unlike Cameron Diaz’s character in The Holiday, I cry all the time. I love a good cry. I love a holiday movie that makes you weep. And if you’re looking for the same, The Holiday should be your go-to.This Nancy Meyers masterpiece is ostensibly about two women, Diaz’s Amanda, an unhappy producer of movie trailers in LA, and Kate Winslet’s Iris, a columnist in England, who swap houses for the holidays — but it’s really about what happens when you surround yourself with people who reflect you back to yourself, and who see you and celebrate you as you’ve always been. You get a contact high when you watch Iris grow from a pushover in love to someone who owns their helpful nature. Her relationship with Eli Wallach’s Arthur, an old-Hollywood legend who finds himself lost in an ever-changing neighborhood and industry, is the kind of wholesomeness 2020 needs in spades. Also somehow this movie makes Jack Black hot???? The Holiday is a perfect hug of a movie — yes for the outrageously hot Jude Law transforming into outrageously hot Dad Mode Jude Law, yes for Winslet screaming in delight while exploring her new digs, yes for the cutest movie children ever captured on film — but most especially yes for the way Meyers commits to screen how these women fall in love with the person they’ve always been, because that’s the most enduring love affair. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudHow to watch: Hulu
 


I’ve always thought of You’ve Got Mail as one of my favorite Christmas movies. A persnickety, contrarian colleague pointed out that since the Meg Ryan–Tom Hanks rom-com partly takes place during the fall, that means it’s not a real “Christmas movie.” So I rewatched and realized why it stands out as a holiday story in my head.It’s technically a movie about an idealistic thirtysomething children’s bookstore owner, Kathleen Kelly (Ryan), being catfished by her online pen pal, big-box superstore owner Joe Fox (Hanks), who pushes her indie shop out of business.The story ends in spring, when (spoiler alert) Ryan and Hanks fall in love — but it’s not about romance or new beginnings. It’s really all about the kind of melancholy that the holidays impose. Writer Nora Ephron drew on the 1940s-era screwball rom-com The Shop Around the Corner for inspiration, and that’s partly why, despite its late-nineties online dating–era update, the movie has a retro sheen and soundtrack that adds to the nostalgia.Tellingly, the story’s most dramatic arc and climax take place during Christmas, as Kelly battles for her store while putting up twinkle lights. The store’s demise happens as Kelly liquidates the books, wrapping them up as holiday gifts. She yearns for her mother amid the loss of her store, which makes sense because the holidays are so much about sitting in one’s feelings about family and relationships.The movie makes us root for Kelly’s Santa Claus–like belief in the magic of childhood (though it also asks us to root for a white lady as a victim of gentrification). Even the antiseptic chemistry between the leads feels sanitized in the family-friendly mode of Hallmark holiday fare. In short, You’ve Got Mail is a movie about the sentimentalities that prop up capitalism, and that’s what Christmas is all about. —Alessa DominguezHow to watch: HBO Max ●

It’s not just you — people are prone to moods during the holidays, and more than half feel some stress and fatigue during the final weeks of the year.“The holiday blues are real,” said Elaine Rodino, a psychologist in private practice in State College, Pennsylvania.Travel, dealing with family, and spending money are among the top reasons some people feel less than jolly over the holidays. It’s typically not clinical depression, Rodino said — more of a malaise or dread over the storybook moments of Christmas: shopping, the family dinner, and opening presents. Advertisement     “If one were to devise an experimental set of circumstances which would test the integrity of an individual’s mood control, one would invent the year-end holiday season,” wrote psychiatrist Jonathan Himmelhoch of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic nearly four decades ago in a report on the holiday blues, calling such feelings a predictable, genuine reaction to the season.“You may find yourself fighting over the remote with a sibling you haven’t seen in a year,” psychologist Pauline Wallin, author of Taming Your Inner Brat: A Guide for Transforming Self-Defeating Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. “Of course it is not about the remote, but power and competition, and the feelings around sibling rivalry.”“Have a plan for dealing with it,” she advised. If you know one relative is going to be a problem, for example, think ahead on how you want to deal with them to feel better about yourself at the end of the holiday, perhaps by watching a movie or spending time with the nieces and nephews instead of joining a family argument.“Emotional detachment is bad for resolving conflicts in close relationships, but for getting through short-term ones, it’s not a bad solution,” she said. Imagine you are watching a movie of people arguing (“or Mike Pence watching the president argue,” she joked) instead of jumping in the middle of the long-running family dispute.“And if you can feel compassion for that grumpy uncle who drives you crazy — he might just be lonely — that’s better than being angry,” she said.

For college students, grades from a just-ended semester are a perpetual worry on returning home for the holidays, since those are often the subject of questions bombarding them when they walk through the door.“There may be concerns about academic performance, about being honest with parents about having a less-than-stellar semester, fears of disappointing family members, not being honest about how things are going,” psychologist Sherry Molock of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News by email.“Some students are discovering who they are (and are not) and are anxious about sharing this info with family,” she said. Sources of stress range from discovering a sexual identity or falling in love with someone who parents might dislike to changing majors. “I am often surprised about how scared students are to tell their parents they are switching to a major that they think their parents will disapprove of,” Molock said.The upside of the holidays is that they end, and with them, seasonal stress for most people. “It’s okay to feel sad,” Wallin said. “I try to tell people that Christmas is just like any other day, it’s only 24 hours, and they can move on to feel a new sense of purpose afterwards.” Advertisement     Although general malaise goes up over the holiday season, psychiatric referrals for suicides actually drop, CDC statistics show, and have for decades. The bulwark of family and friends being around seems to make people less likely to commit suicide.A more worrisome time for people with serious depression comes in the spring, when suicide rates are highest. Mental health experts have written about a “rebound effect” or a “broken-promises effect” among people with clinical depression who soldier through the holidays but commit suicide later, after the joy of the season wears off.If the negative feelings people have in December persist into January or the months afterward, something is more deeply wrong and you really should see someone for help, Rodino said. And if you have trouble getting out of bed months after the holidays, that’s a very bad sign.Although the holiday blues are real for some, more people report feeling happy or festive during the holidays overall. “Christmas isn’t meant to be some sort of mental health challenge,” said Wallin. “People get too caught up in trying to make everything perfect for the holidays.”“I ask kids in January or February what they got for Christmas. They don’t remember. So don’t worry if everything isn’t perfect.”The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org.

Every year during the holiday season, 33-year-old Christina Vineyard and her mom, Chris Caron, looked forward to their favorite tradition of watching Hallmark Christmas movies together. Vineyard, an attorney in Birmingham, Alabama, started watching the popular made-for-TV films because her mom was obsessed with the picturesque, fictional small towns, the Christmas-themed storylines, and the predictable happily-ever-after endings.This is Vineyard’s first Christmas without her mom — both of her parents died in the past year, her dad of a heart attack and her mom of breast cancer — and she hasn’t been able to bring herself to watch a Hallmark Christmas movie from start to finish yet. Advertisement  “It’s just hard, I miss watching them with her,” Vineyard said. “It was just something that we could do together that we bonded over, we always connected over it.”Vineyard and her mom recorded all the same movies on their DVRs, downloaded the Hallmark Movie Checklist app, and had even planned on attending the inaugural Christmas Con in New Jersey this December before they found out how sick Chris was. They loved watching the movies for the same reason millions of people tune in to the Hallmark Channel every holiday season: “It’s just something to watch that’s mindless and doesn’t stress you out.”
 


“It’s not political,” Vineyard added. “It’s something somebody can watch and just be happy about, something that can take your mind off the world for a little bit.”Vineyard posted a version of her story in a private Facebook group called Hallmark Christmas Movies that her mom invited her to join before she died. After sharing with the group, which is more than 22,000 members strong, Vineyard received nearly 500 likes and almost 250 comments. Someone is even sending her a package of goodies they picked up at Christmas Con a couple weeks ago.“At first I thought, Well, I’m kind of being silly posting in this group, but they didn’t make me feel silly. They make you feel like, ‘It’s okay, we’re here to cry with you.’”This Facebook group isn’t just a safe space for dedicated Hallmark fans (also known as Hallmarkies) to post about their obsessions with holiday films. Vineyard’s story about her parents is one of many Hallmarkies have shared about how they lean on Hallmark Christmas movies to heal from surgeries, cope with grief, and feel a sliver of hope and joy in a world that can otherwise seem dark and disheartening.“People need to feel good. They need to feel positive,” said Michelle Vicary, the executive vice president of programming and network publicity for Crown Media Family Networks, which owns the Hallmark Channel. “There’s so much good television that is dark, edgy, and fantastic. But in the huge spectrum of the human experience, things can also turn out okay. Life can be good and life can be positive, and people need that too. That’s where we come in and that’s where our brand comes in and delivers on an emotional experience that says, ‘You know what, things are going to turn out okay, and you’re good and life is good.’”
 


While the Facebook group is representative of a rabid fan base, its 22,000 members are only a tiny portion of the tens of millions of people who tune in to the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season. In 2019, the network has already hit record-breaking numbers since the annual Countdown to Christmas programming kicked off on Oct. 25, with 40 million unduplicated viewers having already watched holiday programming across all of Hallmark’s channels, including Hallmark Drama’s Home for the Holidays and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries’ Miracles of Christmas.People also look to Lifetime’s annual slate of Christmas movies, and other networks, like Freeform and now even Netflix, come out with new holiday movies every year. But the ratings for Hallmark Christmas movies speak for themselves, showing how the channel has cornered the market on holiday romantic dramedies.“We’ve had nearly 10 million people set reminders about upcoming movies on the checklist app, we’ve had 40 million people watch one of our services to date, and we still have so much to go before Christmas,” Vicary told BuzzFeed News. “We had 85 million people watch us last year and we’re already halfway to that before Thanksgiving. That is as mainstream as it gets.”The Hallmark Christmas movie empire has a wide-ranging audience (with most of its viewers being women between the ages of 25 and 54), but when it comes to its onscreen representation, the vast majority of its films lack diversity in race, ethnicity, and sexual identities. The channel has been criticized for its all-straight and mostly white Christmas movie casts; with all of its increasing content over the years, there has never been an LGBTQ couple at the center of a Christmas movie, and non-white characters are few and far between. Advertisement  
 


“We are much like the rest of the industry. We are making strides to correct for that, and we have great movies this year that address diversity,” Vicary said, pointing to Patti LaBelle’s A Family Christmas Gift, A Christmas Miracle starring Tamera Mowry-Housley, and A Christmas Duet with Chaley Rose and Rome Flynn. “I think that there’s still a ways to go, so I would say to our critics, thank you for continuing to come with us on this journey as we correct for that as the industry has.”Loyal viewers look forward to watching their favorite classics and excitedly anticipate new movies starring Hallmark’s “Christmas queens,” like Candace Cameron Bure, Autumn Reeser, and Lacey Chabert, who have built careers and personal brands around their involvement in the films. Hallmark’s Christmas movies have also cemented their place in popular culture with parody sketches on Saturday Night Live, mentions by late-night television hosts, and even a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Advertisement  Hallmark feeds this fandom with merchandise, its checklist app, and this year, an inaugural Christmas Con event in New Jersey. It even has its own publishing division.But the movies didn’t become a cornerstone of the Hallmark brand overnight. The G-rated, holiday-themed romantic dramas have grown into a phenomenon because people want an escape from the less idealistic realities of their lives and the world around them, and because Hallmark saw the potential in early viewership numbers.
 


The Hallmark Channel originated in 2001 when it rebranded from the Odyssey Network, a cable channel that aired religious programming. In 2002, it aired its first-ever Christmas movie, Santa Jr. Original holiday movies continued to air through the years, but then the success of The Christmas Card in 2006 prompted the network to consider focusing on holiday programming. “Countdown to Christmas” was born a decade ago and features Christmas movies every weekend from the beginning of November — and now starting at the end of October — until the end of December.The popularity of the films has skyrocketed over the last decade. In 2015, 62 million unduplicated viewers tuned in to Countdown to Christmas, growing to 70 million in 2016 and 72 million in 2017. The rise in viewership inspired an increase in original Christmas movies on the channel. In 2010, there was a jump to 12 original films, and then to 16 in 2015. The following year, Hallmark bumped that number up to 19. Cut to 2019, when the network will air 24 new holiday films. Advertisement  “We can’t give people enough,” Vicary said. “I call it ‘the Hallmark effect’ that we’re having on people right now. When you come to us, you’re going to feel a little bit better about the world and about yourself not just from watching a show, but because of the entire brand experience.”And those are just the numbers for original films. From right before Halloween until New Year’s Eve, the network will show a total of 40 Christmas movies, airing a combination of the 24 new films and fan favorites from past years. Meanwhile, Hallmark is already in production on its slate for 2020 and planning for 2021.“We are Christmas all the time,” Vicary said.
 


While some of the made-for-television films have higher production values than others, they all have similar formats, and they always provide viewers with happy endings. Superfans are rarely surprised by the plots and can often guess what’s coming next for the characters onscreen. And yet, millions of people can’t get enough. These films provide a simple joy to people who want to tune out the rest of the world, especially during the holiday season. Advertisement  Jennifer Johnson, a 42-year-old 911 operator from a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, has been a longtime Hallmarkie and uses the checklist app to keep track of her progress.Johnson’s affinity for the movies even inspired her to compare her life to a Hallmark Christmas movie three years ago, when she took a part-time retail job during the holiday season. While working two jobs to make ends meet and pay off her bills, Johnson said she developed a crush on a coworker. The two ended up falling in love and dating for a couple of years before breaking up and staying friends. It wasn’t necessarily a happily ever after, but Johnson said her real life mirrored the things she loves about Hallmark’s Christmas movies: a bit of joy amid some darkness, all taking place during the Christmas season.“Hallmark Christmas movies always have a strong female character who are never really looking for love, they always have other things going on, but they end up falling in love,” Johnson said. “And I felt like that was me. I felt like I was that strong female working to make ends meet … Hallmark Christmas movies to me are like the modern-day fairy tale.”As a 911 operator, Johnson said her job is incredibly stressful, and at the end of a long day at work, the movies are “absolutely an escape.” Advertisement  “The last thing I want to do is come home and watch a police drama or anything that remotely relates to reality because I get enough of that at work,” Johnson said. “I deal with enough of reality on a day-to-day basis.”

Like many on TikTok, I saw Amy Wilichowski make pesto eggs — add pesto to a pan, fry eggs in delicious basil-oil-nut paste — so naturally, I too made pesto eggs.The 25-year-old from Boston makes no claims of being the creator of the recipe, but she did say that she was contacted by TikTok and offered $5,000 for her pesto eggs to be included in the new initiative.“I essentially signed a contract saying I was OK with them using my idea as long as I got credited for it,” Wilichowski told Please Like Me. “How it was worded was that a version of my pesto eggs will be included in TikTok Kitchens.”As the company attempts to further cash in on its online dominance with a real-world experience, you have to wonder: Who is going to want to order pesto eggs via a food delivery service about nine months after they were first introduced to the concept?Wilichowski certainly doesn’t know, noting: “That’s not something I would personally want to order on a food delivery app — the yolk is probably cold, it might harden. A sunny-side egg isn’t something you order on Uber Eats.”But she’s expecting TikTok Kitchens to make delivery-friendly pesto eggs, and she thinks her fellow foodies are due to win big, with both money and attention. Advertisement     “I think it’s an amazing idea because I feel like you have all these people who love making food and creating food that are going to get to be in the spotlight with this,” Wilichowski said.The registered dietician and cooking enthusiast dreams of one day owning her own restaurant, and if TikTok is true to its promise, greater things could be on the horizon for creators like her.The company is reported to be putting part of its share of the profits from this venture into supporting creators.In a strange development, when I reached out to TikTok for clarity on which other food content creators had been tapped, a spokesperson called the campaign announcement “premature” and said that things were “still very much in the planning stages.”How the company will unravel the question of who these recipes belong to and if a trending recipe can exist outside of the trending moment is yet to be determined, but I suspect those are the details you figure out when you’re “still very much in the planning stage.”
 


While TikTok is trying to cook us dinner, British journalist Symeon Brown is turning up the heat on the influencer economy in his upcoming book Get Rich or Lie Trying, which I was able to get an advanced copy of since I’m lucky enough to know him IRL.Brown has previously reported on Instagram’s self-styled finance bros, dubbed the “wolves of Instagram,” who routinely promote risky financial products, and use their social media to show off a lavish lifestyle and recruit their unassuming victims.There’s never been a shortage of criticisms of influencers, but a quick search for literature on the broader industry is more likely to turn up suggestions of how you too can become an influencer and transform your basic social media profile into a money-making vehicle while unlocking the girlboss that lies dormant in you.Given that 86% of young Americans reportedly want to become social media influencers, Brown asks the question: “Do they know what they’re letting themselves in for?”Beyond the success stories and household names that have dominated digital culture and carry clout capital, there is a long line of influencers-in-waiting constantly repackaging themselves against a backdrop of financial insecurity and rabid competition.LA YouTube pranksters, OnlyFans creators, dropshippers, the list goes on, and Brown introduces it all while interrogating the dark side of the attention economy.“When the lockdown happened, everyone on my feed was trying to make a buck online,” Brown told me. “My timeline was filled with pyramid schemes, dodgy crypto coins, or friends desperately trying to grow their social media followings to join the growing ranks of digital hustlers.”Money wasn’t the only factor though. “The pivot to influencer is as much about the new capital of internet popularity as it is about pervasive economic precarity,” Brown said. “The book was really trying to tell the story of an ambitious generation who feel shortchanged, disillusioned, and instead of beating the system, believe they have to join it by any means — get rich or lie trying.”Till I can figure out what viral meal I can make to earn a quick $5,000, I’ll meditate this festive season on Brown’s words and wonder how influencers will handle the third year of a global pandemic.Happy holidays,Ade

Tervis insulated tumblers — $34.99 for a four-pack at Amazon2021 was the year I accepted that I needed some kid-friendly plastic drinking glasses for adults. They keep cold drinks cold for an impressively long time — I’ll leave an iced coffee out and find it two hours later with ice cubes still intact. Best of all, the insulation means no condensation sweat to leave rings on wood tables. They’re not the chicest-looking drinkware, but they’re perfect for daily use. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Casio travel alarm clock — $13.95 at AmazonI recently full-on slept through my phone alarm, which was...concerning. Though it did not totally fuck me over on that particular day, it was a wake-up call (lol) that my iPhone cannot be trusted as the sole thing to get me out of bed on time. I purchased a tiny, real alarm clock, and you should, too. It has performed its job of waking me up on time without incident, with the added benefit of not having the very first experience of the day be a blast in the face of the inevitable bad vibes of my phone. Plus, it's cute! —Addy Baird
 


A daily NYT crossword puzzle calendar — $14 at AmazonI refuse to look at my phone’s Screen Time, but I’m sure that in 2020 I spent at least 80% of my waking hours looking at my phone or laptop. I knew it was hurting my eyes and brain, but I struggled during quarantine to find a hobby I enjoyed that took me completely offline. At the end of that year, I bought a crossword puzzle calendar to give myself a daily task (I’m bad at hobbies so hobbies must be tasks) for 2021 that could take anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours to complete. I set myself rules to make it feel even more like an accomplishment (again I am not saying this is the right way to do things): I never google clues, but I can phone a friend. I can’t rip off a day until I’ve finished it (except for the times when I got behind by a week...catching up on that is too much pressure so I just rip seven days off in a chunk like they never happened). The compact page-a-day calendar was easy to take on trips to the woods where my friends would offer to help with the puzzle and then immediately get frustrated that they didn't know which seven-time Emmy winner a clue could possibly be referring to (Ed Asner). Patience is key with crosswords, and the joy of it isn't fun for the whole family, but rather a peaceful, solitary task that doesn't involve looking at my freaking phone. —Sarah Schweppe Advertisement  
 


LoveSac — $1,062–$1317.50 (on sale) at LoveSacA defining image of the pandemic for me is our 60-pound “puppy” cannonballing my unsuspecting daughter as she relaxed in the mountainous LoveSac that now sits, like a befurred and cuddly Jabba the Hutt in our family room. (LoveSac loaned BuzzFeed this item to review.) It’s difficult to describe just how comfortable and how much fun this thing is. Imagine sitting in a bathtub full of fur or a vast kangaroo pouch. Now, imagine doing it with another person. And now add a dog. The big caveat here is that you really need to have a good appreciation for the ridiculous to live with one of the larger LoveSacs as they are Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder–size, but wow, what a wonderful thing to watch movies from. —John Paczkowski
 


The Citizenry linen sheet set — $230 at The CitizenryYears ago when the direct-to-consumer bedding marker first emerged I bought a set of Parachute linen sheets. I remember being thrilled with them at the time, but they lost their color within a year and ripped soon after. So earlier this year we bought some new linen sheets from The Citizenry. I don’t often use the word lovely, but these sheets demand it. They are lovely, deliciously comfortable, and have withstood repeated washings inspired by a strong desire to ALWAYS have them on our bed, which is where I’m writing this because why not? —John Paczkowski
 


Nugget play couch — $259 at NuggetIn fall 2020, I wrote about how hard-to-buy Nugget play couches had become like Supreme drops for moms. The foam couch had grown a cult following through Facebook parent groups as a fun, fort-buildable couch that kids could climb on while doubling as playroom furniture that came in an Instagram-worthy array of colors. The pandemic created a surge in demand and a slowdown in production, resulting in a “drop” system where restocks would sell out within minutes. After publishing my article, I decided to buy one myself.My verdict: It’s absolutely worth the hype. My kid loves climbing and jumping on it, and the best endorsement I can offer any parent is that after an early evening session of Nugget play, he will conk right out at bedtime. Advertisement  There are now plenty of competitors to the Nugget couch, but a lot of them are way more expensive. Though colors are still limited, it’s possible to actually order one now. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Betta fish tank and supplies — tank, $27.99; filters, $8.49; and water conditioner, $2.49 at Amazon; betta fish, ~$5 at your local storeI absolutely did not want a fish. My son had been begging for a fish for months (downgraded from a dog at least), and I relented last January in a moment of pandemic-induced guilt. He couldn't have playdates with real children, but maybe he could have a fish companion. I dreaded cleaning the gross bowl, remembering to feed him, and having to explain his inevitable death to a small child.Turns out I was wrong. I love Swimmy, the blue betta fish. After a short-lived period of my son feeding him a single pellet in the morning and evening, I’ve taken over his feeding duties, and I enjoy it. I talk to Swimmy, greeting him in the morning and evening. I find the light in his tank a helpful nightlight in the kitchen — the one light that stays on, and his tank is even kind of attractive.Best of all, cleaning his tank is easier than I thought it would be. Instead of dumping all the water out weekly, you replace about a third of the tank every three to five days, while the fish stays in the tank (I just scoop it out with a measuring cup). —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Hummingbird feeder — $25 at AmazonHummingbirds are assholes. (OK, just some hummingbirds are assholes. But they’re all adorable!) This I learned after hanging my first-ever hummingbird feeder, daring to hope that it would attract the eponymous visitors. (After being cooped up in a gloomy one-bedroom apartment for a year and a half during the pandemic, we finally moved this summer to a sunny place with a yard.)It didn’t take long — within hours, a colorful lil’ cutie was slurping up nectar (1 part sugar, 4 parts water, easy-peasy) and buzzing around the patio. News spread quickly and a number of their friends popped by — only to be chased away by the aforementioned asshole, who perched near the feeder and spent the whole day scaring off the competition (with a clicking noise we originally thought signaled an electrical problem). I decided I needed another feeder placed far enough away to satisfy other customers.Two feeders became four, four became six. For prime window viewing, I bought a couple of tall shepherd’s hooks. Now we (and our cats) can see the hummingbirds (most of whom are not assholes) from nearly every room in the house. Often when I’m outside replacing a feeder (every four to five days), a hummingbird will buzz around my head like I’m Snow White. Because of these tiny, extraordinary creatures, I experience joy — however fleeting — every single day. Even in 2021!I’ve got Amazon open in another tab, and I’m about to hit “buy now” on my seventh feeder. Can you blame me? —Dru Moorhouse
 


Outward Hound Invincibles stuffingless squeaky dog toy — $14 at AmazonBy the time our new ""puppy"" was 7 months old, he weighed 80 pounds and had probably destroyed his own weight in dog toys. We very quickly lost count of the ""indestructible"" plushies that were disemboweled and drawn and quartered in the one-puppy Battle of Helm's Deep that has been raging in our living room for months now. Only one toy has survived: an Outward Hound Invincibles snake. While he's been desqueaked, brutalized, and used to tow me around in an office chair, Severus Snake, as we call him, endures. He may well be immortal. —John Paczkowski
 


Just fill a sock with catnip, folksThis is Sir Jiggery Pokery, love of my life and the best decision I ever made. He is named after Antonin Scalia’s colorful dissent in King v. Burwell. (Scalia was a hilarious writer, as long as he was in dissent.) But Jiggers, bless him, has no love for cat toys. If it was made for cats, he is not interested in it, because, well, that’s how being a cat works.But he is not impervious to the chemical weaknesses of his kind. At some point during the pandemic, I got a big tub of catnip, took an unmatched sock, shoveled about a cup of the catnip into it, and tied off the top. Jigs promptly took the sock and wrapped it around his head, flailing about in the most feline of highs. Advertisement  Later that evening, he was running around the kitchen diving into empty Whole Foods bags, as one does, and he managed to get the handle of one stuck around his neck. Alarmed, he leapt into the air and ripped the bag in two. He then sprinted across the house, up the stairs, and under the bed, with half the paper bag flying behind him like a superhero cape.Anyway: Get a cat; they are one of life’s great delights. Then get a big tub of catnip and get him real high. —Emily Baker-White
 


Husky workbench as standing desk — $299 at Home DepotAfter 16 months of the pandemic, I figured it would be a good idea to get a desk for my apartment that would not also come with physical therapy for my body. I wanted an adjustable standing desk, but not something that cost $800+ or looked really stupid. I was lucky enough to have been tipped off to a secret: Workbenches sold by Home Depot intended for, I don't know, workbench stuff, actually make for perfect and cheap standing desks. This one is great — it looks fine, it comes on wheels if I need to clear space, it has a cool hand crank that's easy to use. And, best of all, it says “Husky” on it in big letters with a wolf head decal, which makes me feel very powerful while I stare at Tweetdeck. —Matt BermanOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

218,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

220,It’s not like these movies instantly cured my malaise. But they did give me hope.,"


A 23-year-old woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on Thursday after repeatedly telling her boyfriend to kill himself, which he went on to do, while they were students at Boston College.Inyoung You's guilty plea showed she accepted responsibility that her verbal, physical, and psychological abuse contributed to the suicide of Alexander Urtula, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said. You had originally pleaded not guilty in 2019; under the new plea agreement, she received a suspended sentence. If she violates any of her probation terms over the next 10 years, she could serve two and a half years in jail. Advertisement     Among the terms of the agreement are that she will undergo mental health treatment and do community service. In addition, she may not profit from any portrayal of the case over the next 10 years.“This agreement with defense counsel was made in close consultation with the Urtula family. It is consistent with their desire to seek accountability and closure and to protect the legacy of Alexander, a loving son, brother, and uncle,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a statement. ""They believe this is something Alexander would have wanted.""You's lawyer did not immediately return BuzzFeed News' request for comment.The two began dating in late 2017 or early 2018, BuzzFeed News previously reported. Prosecutors alleged that You became abusive toward Urtula in late summer 2018 after she found out he lied about meeting with his ex-girlfriend. Advertisement     Prosecutors argued that You failed to stop her boyfriend even though she knew where he was and what he was going to do. They argued this made her “criminally responsible” for his suicide.Throughout You and Urtula's 18-month relationship, You sent many abusive texts to Urtula, often telling him to die by suicide.""do everyone a favor and go fucking kill yourself, you’re such a fucking stupid ass worthless shit,"" You texted 22-year-old Urtula, BuzzFeed News reported in 2019.
 


Urtula died on May 20, 2019, just hours before his college graduation. You was tracking his phone that morning and was present at the time of his death. Urtula's family was in town for his graduation.Four days before his death, You texted him, ""FUCK YOU GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF...""Steven Kim, You’s attorney, said in a statement in November 2019 that prosecutors had branded “an emotionally fragile young woman a monster to the entire world, further traumatizing her.”Before You's arraignment, the Boston Globe published texts between You and Urtula before his death.“ALEX. WHAT SRE YOU [expletive] DOING. IF U [expletive] LOVE ME STOP. IF U EVER [expletive] LOVED ME STOP,"" You texted Urtula, according to the Boston Globe. Advertisement     But You's abuse throughout their relationship had been ""near constant,"" Rollins said on Thursday. It became more disturbing and more frequent in the days before his death, as documented in the text messages and other evidence.Rollins added the case showed how serious domestic violence is, and that it can affect many types of victims and take many forms. She urged anyone experiencing intimate partner violence to reach out to law enforcement or community groups for help.""We want you healthy and alive,"" she said. ""Please come to us for help if you feel unsafe, scared, or desperate as a result of abuse, bullying, or threats of harm or violence.”The US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

“I think someone entered something in your chart wrong,” a physician's assistant said to me over a video call on Saturday. “It says you’ve had COVID-19 three times.”“Nope, not a mistake.” I smiled, chuckling at her confounded expression. “Isn’t that hilarious?”At this point, nearly two years into this pandemic, vaccinated and having symptomatic COVID for the third time, all I can really do is laugh.I’ve been first in line for each new variant. I’m a COVID nerd, collecting each new edition. I gotta catch ’em all. I’m one of those guys in the lawn chairs outside of the Apple Store every time a new iPhone drops. I’ve punched each hole on the variant punch card: Omicron, Delta, and original flavor. Coronavirus 3: The Sickening. Advertisement  I know this is no laughing matter. People I know have died, or nearly died, from COVID. I am lucky I am not immunocompromised. I am lucky to have access to doctors, resources, and a support system. I don’t have asthma. I’m lucky I have enough breath to laugh at all.“Wow, that is brutal, I’m so sorry,” Dr. Deepta Bhattacharya, a professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, said to me after I told him about my situation. “But boy, I would love to get some blood samples from you.”I was flattered.Bhattacharya says my situation is incredibly rare. Including all my infections and vaccinations, I have been directly exposed to the virus, or parts of it that trigger an immune reaction, five times. My antibodies should be as jacked as an Instagram bodybuilder. But apparently, they’re not.It was hard for him to say why this has been the case for me. It’s possible I am genetically predisposed to have low antibody levels. Or it could be that I “won the bad luck jackpot.”Even if I do seem to be a freak of immunological nature, I am not the only one. For this article I tweeted about being cursed thrice with COVID, hoping to find others. After sifting through dozens of predictably brutal condemnations of my behavior from total strangers, I found I was not alone.“So what’s wrong with us?” Lucien Baskin, a 23-year-old graduate student who lives in Midwood, Brooklyn, asked me — once I fought my fatigue enough to give them a call. “Should I buy a lottery ticket?” Advertisement  The First Time I Got COVIDThe first time I got COVID, hipster that I am, was right when it started trending. It was in March 2020, the first week of lockdown. Back then, we were so young and dumb. There were barely any COVID tests available to the general public (unlike now, where you need to wait hours for a nose swab). Losing your sense of taste and smell was just a rumored symptom.Lucien, who uses he/they pronouns, got it for the first time in February 2021. They attribute this to their large apartment building where few people wear masks.As I lay on my couch and felt like I couldn’t move, my partner at the time zipped around me, making jokes and playing music, full of nervous energy. I had a splitting headache that I thought was a migraine. I suggested I may have The Novel Coronavirus, but my partner convinced me it was just anxiety about the world ending. Fair enough. But then I accidentally smashed a bottle of perfume on my bathroom floor and it smelled like nothing.Lucien also had a high fever and contemplated going to the hospital that first time, but they opted to just eat a bunch of Tylenol and try to sleep it off. Luckily, that worked.A couple months later, my sense of smell had returned and I tested positive for antibodies. My live-in partner, for whatever reason, did not.The Second Time I Got COVIDIn April 2021, the vaccine came. I got a double shot of Moderna. Lucien got Pfizer. For a brief moment, everything seemed like it was going to be OK. No one wore masks indoors. Strangers smiled at each other on the street. I went dancing in a crowded indoor bar with my friends. At first I nearly had a panic attack — I hadn’t smelled strangers’ sweat in over a year — but then I took a couple shots of tequila and sang along to Madonna and openly cried with relief. It was euphoric. This was not the second time I got COVID. Advertisement  Lucien was more conservative in their behavior than me. They believe they caught it a second time watching the European championship games indoors at a local café in early July, right as the Delta variant started spreading around New York. They couldn’t believe it.
 


I got it just a few weeks later, in mid-August. New York hadn’t yet passed the law requiring bars and restaurants to check vaccine cards and IDs for entry, so I had started wearing a mask again when ordering. I went to a bar with a large outdoor area and an indoor dance floor with some coworkers, briefly dancing inside. I went to an outdoor work party. I was lucky enough to not have to go into an office and rarely had to leave my neighborhood. I took no more risks than most of my vaccinated friends, and many of them took more risks than me.One afternoon, I went to the beach. I thought it was cold out, but no one else did. My throat started to hurt. I didn’t think I had COVID, but I got tested anyway: one rapid, one PCR. The rapid was negative. The next day, I got an email about my PCR: positive. I slammed my computer shut and started crying.I don’t know how I got it this second time, either. I informed everyone I had seen, even the person who I had likely kissed while infected. No one tested positive. My friend’s husband (jokingly?) accused me of being a hippie who had lied about her vaccine status.Lucien said their symptoms were less severe the second time. For me, it was worse. This could have been that the symptoms actually were more intense, or it could have been because I got dumped on day one of my 10-day quarantine.My symptoms were flu-like at first: low-grade fever, headache, congestion, mild cough. But then those faded, and the symptoms became more easily justified as psychological. I wondered if I actually couldn’t breathe or was just having a days-long anxiety attack. My primary care doctor told me to get a pulse oximeter to measure my oxygen levels and prescribed me an inhaler. If you’re 95% oxygen saturation or above, you’re good; 91–94, contact a doctor. Below 90, call 911. My oxygen levels never went below the point when you should check yourself into a hospital, but they got close.I attempted to distract myself with work but would find that I was regularly writing words phonetically instead of how they were actually spelled. At a certain point, it felt like I’d hit an invisible wall. Suddenly, even typing “Not feeling good, gotta take a break” in Slack took significant effort. It was deeply depressing and isolating. I would try to go for a jog, something I had been doing nearly every day for months, and feel fine as I did it only to be hit over the head with a hammer of renewed symptoms hours or a day later. I was lying on the floor a lot. My cat seemed concerned.These symptoms lasted months after I was allowed back out in the world. I couldn’t drink alcohol without almost immediately feeling like I had developed a cold. I felt I looked older, that I had lost some of my hair. I took advantage of what I thought must be a renewed set of powerful antibodies to socialize with friends, only to feel, all of a sudden, that I had to get home immediately. Despite my last name, I hate Irish goodbyes. I love the drama of a long farewell.The Third Time Having COVIDBy late October, I felt mostly normal. I started running again and drinking alcohol. I went to a residency in rural Virginia for a month and wrote part of a book.I couldn't get access to the booster in Virginia. When I returned to New York just before Thanksgiving, I attempted to get boosted but was turned away at the door due to a scheduling error.My birthday was Dec. 6. All I wanted was to turn 30 with some friends.I gathered a few people — not too many — at a bar on a Monday, when I thought it would be relatively empty. Two of my close friends, bless their hearts, had just returned from attending Art Basel in Miami. My office holiday party was that week but I decided not to go, joking that it was likely to be a superspreader event. Plus, several of my closest friends were driving and flying in from various states and countries to gather upstate in celebration of the end of my third decade. I didn’t want to risk infecting them. I waited four days after my indoor bar experience and got a rapid and a PCR test. Both negative.While I was upstate with my friends, with us singing in each other’s faces, accidentally switching wine glasses and water bottles, people in New York City were contracting COVID at a faster rate than ever before.Turns out I was part of that wave. Somehow, 10 days from the last time I saw them, no one else from my saliva-swapping birthday celebration has tested positive or had symptoms. I am the unlucky one. But I am grateful I did not give all my best friends COVID.This Omicron wave is Lucien’s third time, too, even though they got their booster two weeks before being exposed to the virus. They posted a screenshot of their three positive tests on Instagram Stories and wrote “Oops, I did it again.”“Honestly, being able to write that caption sort of made it all worth it,” Lucien joked as we both dissolved into giggles.
 


This latest experience, for both of us, was much more mild than previous infections. We agreed that this time we recognized it. We woke up with symptoms others could mistake for a cold and just knew, somehow, that it was COVID, again. For me it was something about the way my skin felt my first day of symptoms: hot and prickly, though not like a normal fever, and a cough that felt like something was stuck in my throat.What was most different this time was that my spirits have been strangely high. Maybe it’s just acceptance. This is despite the March 2020–esque shaming that has reemerged in society. Despite people telling me that I must be being reckless to have gotten it this often.Maybe they’re right. But I was taking calculated risks to try to live my life while trying my best not to infect the more vulnerable. If I’m feeling sick, I stay home. I wear my mask when I’m supposed to. As soon as I’m out of quarantine, I’ll try again to get my booster. That’s all I can do.And in any case, this is a public health issue. Blaming individual actions only kicks people while they’re down. It also draws attention away from government officials and healthcare companies to do things like increase global vaccine access and make testing more easily affordable and available.I understand my story scares people. It’s easier to decide it’s my fault than something that could happen to you.Hopefully, That Was The Last TimeNearly everyone I know right now in New York City has either recently tested positive or been exposed. While I wish that it weren’t the case, it has leant a camaraderie to this experience that was significantly lacking the first two times. This time I have been isolating, but I have not been isolated.I’m in multiple group chats — named “media girls w/ covid” and “Ema’s little covid warriors” — in which friends share jokes and commiserate about symptoms and boredom. They’ve also served as a helpful means of getting medical advice and care when the healthcare systems we rely on are overwhelmed. My experience with this virus has made me a valued resource. The other day my friend referred to me as “the COVID Doula.”I am not dispensing medical advice, don’t worry. But I can recommend an oximeter, which you can order from your local pharmacy and lends peace of mind when you’re feeling short of breath. I can suggest asking your doctor, if you have one, about getting an inhaler, which can help open up your airways when it's hard to breathe. Don’t drink alcohol, even if you’re feeling better. Watch movies over TV shows — the time passes quicker. Eucalyptus in the shower is pretty, smells good, and helps with respiratory issues. Mucinex is great for congestion and coughs and gets me a little high in a fun way. (I am not condoning recreational abuse of over-the-counter drugs!) Drink endless liquids. If you’re having chest pains unrelated to coughing, call a doctor.I felt this camaraderie as I spoke to Lucien as well. We compared symptoms and genetic backgrounds, attempting to see if we have anything in common. But then we came to the question that has been on our minds as we’ve been shut inside: Are the rules different for us now?“I am really confused about what to do next,” Lucien said. “I’ve been thinking, when I’m done with my quarantine this time, I’m good, right? I can take the train and be out in the world?”“We have to be immune, at least for a little bit,” I responded, desperation peaking in my voice. I want to spend Christmas with my family.“This has failed me multiple times, this way of thinking,” Lucien said, adding that he is supposed to teach in person next semester. “Do we keep getting boosters? Do we isolate forever? What are the rules for us? How are we supposed to know? It’s not like we can look up the research on people who have had COVID three times.”Lucien is right, Bhattacharya confirmed. There have been some studies on reinfection, but they have indicated that most people with antibodies who get reinfected are asymptomatic, or have symptoms so mild they don’t notice they’re sick. He was unaware of any studies of people having three symptomatic infections. This is why he wants my blood.Bhattacharya did have some good news — not for me or Lucien, but for most of you: Us being vaccinated and getting COVID three times in less than two years is not a dark omen of an inevitable future. You are not likely to become us.“Three symptomatic infections with vaccines sandwiched in between there… That’s sort of different level unlucky, Ema, I’m sorry,” Bhattacharya said.Based on studies of prior coronavirus patterns, as this pandemic continues, and as new variants like Omicron spring up, people will get reinfected with some frequency, he continued. And part of the reason it's spread like wildfire, he said, is because there are still a lot of people with no immunity whatsoever.“But with the assistance of vaccines and prior infections leading to some immunity, an increasingly large fraction of those [getting reinfected] will be, if not completely asymptomatic, symptomatic to the point where you hardly notice it.”How long it will take to get to that place, Bhattacharya added, is still up in the air.“I guess we’re sort of the guinea pigs to see what this looks like,” Lucien said at the end of our conversation. “And if we both end up with COVID again in February, well…”I’m going to act as though I have the same immunity as everyone else, at least for the next month. I’m going to celebrate the holidays. I’m going to see my friends. Maybe I’m being Charlie Brown trying to kick the football over and over only to have it pulled away each time, but I can’t keep myself in a bubble forever. I’ve gotta live my life.But if you’re a scientist and you want to study my blood, please, by all means, take it. Merry Christmas. ●

Former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter was found guilty on manslaughter charges by a jury on Thursday for fatally shooting Daunte Wright.Potter remained composed as Hennepin County District Judge Regina Chu announced the convictions on two charges: first-degree manslaughter predicated on reckless use/handling of a firearm and second-degree manslaughter. Advertisement     Potter now faces several years in prison. She will be sentenced on Feb. 18.The former officer was handcuffed and taken into custody after the verdict was announced, despite a request from her attorneys that she remain out on bail until she is sentenced. ""I cannot treat this case differently from any other case,"" Chu said.Wright's mother, Katie Bryant, told reporters after the verdict that she was overcome with emotion to hear Potter be convicted. ""I kind of let out a yelp because it was built up in the anticipation of what was to come while we were waiting the last few days,"" she said.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said police officers in the state are held in high regard — and to high standards. The conviction, he said, ""shows the whole world that those of you who enforce the law are also having to live by it, and that's a good thing."" Advertisement     ""We have a degree of accountability for Daunte's death,"" he said. ""Accountability is not justice. Justice is restoration. Justice would be restoring Daunte to life and making the Wright family whole again. Justice is beyond the reach that we have in this life for Daunte.""The jury had earlier indicated they were heading toward a potential deadlock, asking the judge on Tuesday what they should do if they were unable to reach a verdict. They were instructed to continue deliberating and did so for almost four days in total.
 


Potter’s conviction comes after she killed the 20-year-old Black motorist during an April 11 traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburbs when the 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department accidentally reached for her handgun instead of her Taser.“This was no little oopsie,” prosecutor Erin Eldridge told the 12 members of the jury in closing arguments on Monday. “This was not putting the wrong date on a check. This was not entering the wrong password somewhere. This was a colossal screwup, a blunder of epic proportions.” Advertisement     The deadly accident was caught on police body camera footage that showed Potter yelling “Taser” before she fired her handgun. “Oh, shit. I shot him. I grabbed the wrong fucking gun,” she then said. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. I’m going to prison.""Potter was subsequently charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter over Wright’s death. To convict her, prosecutors had to prove she acted with recklessness or culpable negligence when she defied years of training and mixed up the weapons.Potter, who resigned after the incident, had always admitted to the shooting but had been adamant that it was an accident during a police encounter that was quickly spiraling out of control and for which she did not deserve to go to prison. “I’m sorry it happened. I’m so sorry,” Potter testified last week. “I didn’t want to hurt anybody.”
 


Defense attorney Earl Gray said Potter had “made a mistake” that could not be seen as a crime.Instead, Gray sought to place blame on Wright for seeking to flee as officers tried to arrest him — actions, Gray said, that put police in danger and to which Potter had been trying to respond with an appropriate, but ultimately mistaken and fatal, use of force. Advertisement     “Daunte Wright caused his own death, unfortunately,” Gray said in closing arguments. “Those are the cold hard facts of the evidence.”Wright had been on his way to a car wash when Potter and a junior officer she was training pulled him over after noticing he had expired tags and an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, a violation of state law. Potter testified that had she been alone she would likely not have stopped Wright, saying that an air freshener was a minor violation and that people were having trouble updating their registrations at the DMV due to the coronavirus pandemic.But when they did a search of his name, they discovered there was a warrant out for his arrest. Wright had missed a court appearance for two misdemeanor charges: carrying a handgun without a permit and running from police last June.Learning of the gun charge, Potter said, made her and her fellow officers wary that Wright might have a weapon on him. However, she conceded in court that she did not see any weapon in Wright’s possession and that he never threatened or punched her or her fellow officers.Alayna Albrecht-Payton, Wright’s girlfriend, was with him during the traffic stop and testified that Wright had been “nervous and flustered” during the police encounter.She tearfully recalled in court how Wright had been on the phone with his mother when he was shot, and how Albrecht-Payton tried in vain to save his life. Advertisement     “I didn’t know what to do, so I just put my hands over his chest and tried to hold [the wound] and tried to scream his name,” she said. “I just tried to have him talk to me. I just kept saying, ‘Daunte, Daunte, just say something please, just talk to me.' And he just couldn’t — I know he tried, I know he wanted to.”""I replay that image in my head daily,"" Albrecht-Payton said.Wright’s mother, Bryant, also testified in court, describing how she had frantically tried to call her son back, only to have Albrecht-Payton answer and begin screaming. ""She said that they shot him and she faced the phone toward the driver's seat,"" Bryant said. ""My son was lying there.""The fatal shooting reignited protests against police killings in Minneapolis, a city that had already been shaken by the murder of George Floyd less than a year earlier. Dozens of people were arrested.Prosecutors sought to portray Potter as an experienced veteran of the force who had undergone extensive annual training on Taser use, only to act with extreme recklessness.“Accidents,” Eldridge said, “can still be crimes.”

Joan Didion, who chronicled everything from counterculture to grief in cold and cutting works of writing, died Thursday. She was 87.Didion died at her New York home from Parkinson’s disease, according to a statement to the press from her publisher, Knopf.“Joan was a brilliant observer and listener, a wise and subtle teller of truths about our present and future,” said Knopf editor Shelley Wagner. “She was fierce and fearless in her reporting. Her writing is timeless and powerful, and her prose has influenced millions.” Advertisement     A fiction author, screenplay writer, essayist, reporter, and memoirist, Didion’s prose helped shape the New Journalism movement, and writing itself, in the latter half of the 20th century after she began her career at Vogue magazine.From columns that explored the cultural revolution of the 1960s to works of fiction that shed pretense for bitter realism, like Play It As It Lays (1970) and A Book of Common Prayer (1977), Didion won fans and acclaim for her exploration of social and personal decay. Her works captured the pain and beauty of being alive by exploring how humanity at once tries to tear itself apart and stitch itself together.
 


Didion first solidified her voice as a journalist by capturing the turmoil of the 1960s, writing for Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post. Her first work of nonfiction, 1968’s Slouching Towards Bethlehem, explored the sense of loneliness, anger, and transformation of California’s counterculture movement, centered in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the late 1960s.California, where the writer was born in 1934, forever captivated Didion, drawing her back throughout her life. “No one wrote better about California and how place shapes our identities,” author Dana Spiotta wrote for Vogue in 2017. Advertisement     Some of Didion’s fondest and happiest memories, she said, were on the beach in Malibu, watching the waves with her husband and young daughter Quintana. She lived all over the Golden State, chronicling its struggles and changes while fixing herself and her history at the center. In doing so, Didion personalized the experience for the reader in a way that felt almost revolutionary.In The White Album (1979), for example, she shared a story of having to go to a hospital in Santa Monica for a psychiatric evaluation after complaining of intense, inexplicable vertigo and nausea as part of her own journey trying to make sense of where she stood in the world.Didion married her own search for spirituality and purpose with her country’s, making a complex, overwhelming cultural shift personal. Her writings changed and defined American journalism and history.
 


One of her most famous essays, ""Goodbye to All That,"" also helped spark the genre of ""Why I Left New York"" pieces. Ultimately, after two decades in Los Angeles, she and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, returned to New York in the late 1980s. The couple were devoted to one another, both personally and professionally, and wrote the screenplay for A Star Is Born (1976) together, among other projects. Advertisement     After Dunne, also a renowned writer and editor, died suddenly in 2003, Didion penned The Year of Magical Thinking, a memoir exploring her raw distress following the death of her husband of 40 years while also navigating her daughter’s severe health issues. She canonized what it meant to grieve, once again coupling intimate stories and memories of her life with research and studies on sorrow and dying. She reported on her own trauma, her own heartbreak, allowing all readers a window into a deeply universal experience.“I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us,” she wrote. “I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.”Didion then adapted the memoir, which won her a National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, into a stage play. In a subsequent memoir, Blue Nights (2011), Didion wrote about the death of her daughter.In 2013, she was honored by then-president Barack Obama with a National Humanities Medal for being what he described as “one of our sharpest and most respected observers of American politics and culture.”“Exploring the culture around us and exposing the depths of sorrow,” the presidential proclamation declared, “Ms. Didion has produced works of startling honesty and fierce intellect, rendered personal stories universal, and illuminated the seemingly peripheral details that are central to our lives.” Advertisement     In her later years, Didion maintained her effortless cool. In 2015, French fashion house Céline chose the reclusive writer as the star of its advertising campaign. The images, showing Didion with her diminutive frame and the brand’s giant sunglasses, quickly went viral.In a curt interview with Time magazine in January, Didion’s trademark matter-of-fact demeanor that shaped her writing remained on full display. “What does it mean to you to be called the voice of your generation?” the interviewer asked.“I don’t have the slightest idea,” Didion responded.

224,He sees you when you’re sleeping; he knows when you’re awake...,"


Earlier this month, British media once again platformed a talking point pushed by anti-trans activists. The Sunday Times, among other outlets, ""reported"" on a backlash to a hypothetical scenario in which a sex offender might choose to identify as a woman. That an imaginary notion was elevated into a news item speaks to the entrenched anti-transness of British media.But then Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling tweeted the article, further elevating the narrative; she became a trending topic on Twitter, promoting a link between transness and sexual violence. US media covered her tweet as a controversy that implied there might be a real threat posed by trans self-determination. It might be too obvious to state, but there isn’t. In fact, there is actually an ongoing epidemic of violence against trans women, and no such pattern of trans women committing violence against cis women or anyone else.This was, however, the latest point of panic in a wave reacting to the so-called transgender tipping point of visibility. And Rowling in particular has chosen to make herself the face of this backlash. Advertisement  Just last year, she publicly targeted clinics where trans youth receive lifesaving gender-affirming treatment, turning trans bodily self-determination into a story about the supposedly threatened safety of cis children. She has also mocked evolving public health language that includes trans men and nonbinary people, hijacking that recognition to create a story about the supposed erasure of cis women.Like fellow billionaire Peter Thiel, she has even reportedly deployed her money and power to try to silence criticism. And yet all the while her anti-trans campaigning is generally characterized by the media as “controversial” “views”: not part of an explicit agenda, but an ongoing human interest mystery chronicled as a perplexing personal evolution.Rowling’s status as a celebrity billionaire affords her extra protection and the benefit of the doubt while also helping to amplify her talking points. But it’s specifically because she speaks as a white woman with “concerns” about the safety of women and children that her anti-trans framing is accepted on Twitter and treated by the media at large as worthy of debate.Never explicitly framed as a misinformation agent who might merit deplatforming, Rowling is a symptom of the current media ecosystem, in which disinformation about minority identities is accepted as legitimate controversy. Advertisement  This scenario comes into play whenever powerful people, institutions, or political organizations raise public concerns about the protection of majority groups, especially white women and children.In fact, two of the biggest, seemingly unrelated, culture war stories this year were propelled by a similar reframing of misinformation as legitimate debate. These so-called controversies were supposedly about trans people, especially trans girls and women, and teaching history, known as the critical race theory debate.Both were part of political backlashes that came in response to increased visibility for minority groups: increased representation of trans people in media and public debate about gender and the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.Framed largely by right-wing activists and think tanks as human interest issues about fairness in sports and classrooms, they circulated into national legacy media — including publications like USA Today, CBS, The Atlantic, and the New York Times — through first-person opinion pieces by mothers of cis athletes raising fears about trans inclusion or human interest reports featuring on-the-ground stories of white moms airing complaints about supposed radical ideas being introduced in schools.Whatever the content of the reporting or articles, in platforming these issues through the “concerns” of cis and white people, mainstream media helped distort what constitutes legitimate perspectives for coverage, and in doing so sidelined the actual difficulties experienced by marginalized communities, including Black and trans youth.Ultimately, this kind of coverage raises deeper questions about news organizations and who decides the perspective of “culture war” journalism.
 


There’s a long history in the US of setting the terms of debate by centering media narratives around the well-being of white women and children. It’s usually associated with anti-Black and anti-gay right-wing activism and can be traced back to anti–school integration campaigns in the ’60s, through “save the children” anti-gay campaigns in the ’70s, and even the coverage questioning how children would fare under marriages between same-sex couples in the aughts.Right-wing activists used similar framing to introduce the so-called controversy over “critical race theory.” Attempts to eradicate histories of race in the US are nothing new. As recently as 2011, activists attempted to ban ethnic studies and Mexican American studies curricula in Arizona. But “ethnic studies” simply doesn’t have the polarizing — or “concerning” — ring necessary to stoke a national panic about existing curricular offerings like studying civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.The term “critical race theory” was perfect for right-wing campaigns, though, because, as one activist told the New Yorker this summer, to “most” Americans it “connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.” So a long-term campaign to dismantle any talk of race and history in schools was rebranded as a crusade against critical race theory, even though that term actually refers to a graduate-level theory about the intersections of law, culture, and structural racism that has nothing to do with elementary history in classrooms.
 


The idea of the country as race-obsessed and race discourse as destructively divisive was already percolating in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, especially after George Floyd’s murder.Outlets like the New York Times and the Atlantic dedicated valuable resources to reporting on the supposed excesses of anti-racism. These “nuance” stories by white journalists included one about a Black father’s school board campaign against anti-racism. In the Times, there was a story about a Black student who made a supposedly false accusation of racial profiling at Smith College. Even attempts at self-reflection centered whiteness and painted anti-racism as an elitist concern; a story about the Times’ own newsroom racism was used to highlight how privileged white high schoolers now felt entitled to call out racism.Right-wing think tanks, like the Manhattan Institute, promoted that precise notion online and in legacy media to activate parents into believing anti-racism was out of control. Quotes from concerned moms further stoked these fears: “They are making my son feel like a racist because of the pigmentation of his skin.”The idea of “talking about race” wasn’t necessarily new to many Black and brown parents for whom discussing the realities of inequality and existing in a white world isn’t an “option” in the same way. Yet outlets including CBS and the Atlantic picked up that framing too, feeding into the sense that radically new ideas were suddenly being introduced with headlines like, “When the culture war comes for the kids,” and “How young is too young to teach kids about race?” (The latter headline was changed after a backlash.)As the November elections neared, news stories about suburban or small-town parents battling over school curricula started popping up as well. The framing of these battles through reported human interest stories, rather than, say, misinformation explainers, suggested that these were newsworthy grassroots issues that spoke to broad parental fears rather than a vocal minority stoking social media disinformation.To some degree, the stories discredited the panic about race education in schools by pointing out the organizations and dark money groups (like the Judicial Crisis Network) who helped fund these campaigns and including voices of supporters of existing curriculums. But they still promoted the idea that these battles represented two equal sides of inflamed national feelings, rather than a strategically invented controversy and well-funded top-down disinformation campaigns.Ultimately, the timing and framing of these stories about race and education highlight that they were not deemed newsworthy because of concerns of the community members at the center, Black parents and youth, or the massive ongoing inequality around race and class that still permeates public schools. Instead, they helped reframe debate to center white parental anxieties.
 


In many ways, this same scenario — misinformation platformed as debate — has been playing out in the coverage of trans people, long before J.K. Rowling seized the moment as a major anti-trans voice. Newsrooms lacking in trans journalists had been framing trans existence through “concerns” that trans people were incapable of deciding their bodily self-determination on their own.This type of clueless question about how young is too young for children to know their gender, coming from outside the trans community, was epitomized by a now-infamous 2018 Atlantic cover story. It explicitly addressed imagined anxious white parents with the (misgendering) headline, “Your child says she’s trans...she’s 13.”The story and its cis panic about trans identity as some kind of trend among teens was later completely debunked by other news outlets. Since then, gender historians have shown the long history of trans children, studies have confirmed that trans children are just as certain about their gender as cis teens. The Atlantic never officially apologized for the story’s framing, including misgendering and outing the cover model. (The writer, however, has since been placed on watch lists for anti-LGBTQ journalism).
 


In the real world, all trans people are not white and not middle class and have little access to healthcare even if they can find an affirming clinic, especially when most insurance companies refuse to cover such care. Trans people struggle not with identity itself, but with an anti-trans world that restricts access to resources for transition and features gatekeepers who set rules and timelines on cis terms. And unsurprisingly, November’s elections saw right-wing activists promoting a new wave of bills blocking access to healthcare for trans people. As GLAAD pointed out, that Atlantic cover story was used in a legal brief filed by seven state attorneys general in a federal lawsuit seeking to roll back existing healthcare access for trans people.This year, right-wing activists expanded their “concern” to sports. And it wasn’t an accident they set that arena as a location to invent debate. Like classrooms, sports are imagined by white Americans as a neutral space of meritocracy, and right-wing think tanks purposely promoted that setting for human interest stories about fairness.Publications including USA Today and the Economist took the bait, uncritically platforming first-person pieces by white mothers and white athletes airing out concerns about maybe having to compete against trans girls. The misinformation spread by cis athletes about hormonal or strength differences was ultimately debunked.But real questions about meritocracy, including around race and class inequality, did not even get folded into these chronicles, revealing that narratives were about the protection of supposedly endangered young white women. This becomes clearer when considering that the surveillance regarding testosterone levels has primarily targeted cis Black women athletes.Given the minority status of trans people in society at large, it’s unsurprising that trans athletes never even materialized in most states where the bills were being pushed. Yet even positive human interest pieces about trans athletes were reactive ones in which trans humanity was rendered visible only in terms of the wave of cis fears.As with the CRT coverage, the focus on questions about youth transition or sports isn’t actually about the struggles of trans people at all, which include disproportionately high rates of housing insecurity and under or unemployment.The sidelining of actual trans issues in order to debate imaginary fears does, however, speak to broader systemic problems with media and the way that trans people circulate as objects of coverage for cis people rather than subjects of their own reality. Even media attempts to cover anti-trans activism have turned into debates between cis women about transness through controversies about trans exclusionary radical feminists (TERFS).That moniker itself, recently used to describe Rowling, platforms anti-trans activists within the context of feminism and has lent legitimacy to their efforts, portraying bigotry as some kind of newfangled intellectual exercise over the meaning of feminism or queer community. In fact, anti-transness is part of a long history of class and racial exclusions in feminism, both in media and, most importantly, in the real world, where trans identity has been made into a scapegoat for anger about inequality more broadly.
 


It’s unquestionable that the CRT and trans “debates” have been pushed into the media by right-wing activism and conservative politicians through strategic waves of anti-CRT and anti-trans bills. They’re even timed to purposely inflame conservatives and rally the base for elections.But at this point, it’s too easy to see anti-trans and anti-Black concern-mongering as just an issue of right-wing misinformation. After all, these framings are accepted for coverage via the editorial judgments of majority white and cis newsrooms.So-called culture war issues are where the media allows itself maximal editorializing on behalf of cis white “anxieties” and fears about a changing world. But the terms for what becomes a culture war story are not decided by the public. Instead, they are decided in newsrooms that don’t mirror reality but certainly help shape it.American newsrooms are even whiter than the country as a whole, and it’s in that context of media echo chambers that “critical race theory” is repackaged as controversial. Most Americans believe the history of slavery should be taught, for instance. And after the 2021 November election, polls showed that even the idea that critical race theory drove elections was overstated.Similarly, trans rights are actually not “controversial” in the US population at large. But trans journalists are woefully underrepresented in newsrooms. It’s predictable that cis journalists talking to each other about transness results in stories that home in on and magnify cis debates about trans identity. This dynamic sidelines the potential richness of good faith exchanges within the trans community about the complexity of existing in a cis world.Current thinking about misinformation is focused on anti-science or partisan campaigns that exist in the social media ether. But there are other important questions, like the way the media feeds into misinformation by platforming sources that reframe debate outside the terms of the communities these “debates” actually affect. Advertisement  
 


“Partisanship” is still the favored term in journalism for talking about media “balance.” But considering editorial judgment through partisanship simply recreates existing power imbalances by focusing on issues about race, class, and gender only if they’re legible through the lens of Republican vs. Democrat. It would mean something quite different if corporate media held itself accountable to the communities it covers rather than political parties.Categorizing questions about ethical coverage through partisanship issues also helps ignore uncomfortable realities about news capitalism, like the fact that newsrooms need to make a profit and stories are often packaged for advertisers and imagined white readers.Financial incentives are a major reason why it’s hard to wean media off engaging with misinformative framings to capture cis and white readers, which still constitute a majority of the public. After all, these panicked stories feed engagement for Twitter, Facebook, legacy media, and new venture capitalist corporate platforms like Substack.It’s not an accident that in all the race and trans backlash stories, class is invoked not to call out how white middle- and upper-class perspectives shape newsrooms (including through media CEOs). Instead, it is invoked to imply that anti-racism or trans rights are somehow an “elitist” concern. This framing takes pressure off the publications themselves to engage with these issues as a labor concern in their own newsrooms. But divorcing stories about class and identity from the real world and existing power structures is a distortion. Framing and context shouldn’t only be dictated by cis white fears and concerns.Still, there have been some changes by newsrooms around the framing of stories to acknowledge power imbalances in the real world. The Verge has updated its policies for giving big tech companies anonymity as background sources for articles. Some news organizations are questioning the uncritical use of police sources when ascertaining the truth of events. Cis and white “concerned parents” might be less obviously identifiable as problematic sources, but it’s a powerful category of people due for a similar reckoning.Tellingly, after a backlash to the white framing of its “how young is too young” CRT story, CBS changed the headline — not to, say, “White Parents Are Finally Having to Grapple with Questions Others Routinely Do.” Instead, it was replaced with a nonclickbait-y mouthful: “Documentary explores debate over how and when race should be taught in schools.”That shift of the framing to “debate” is the customary way mainstream media dodges any pressure about “taking sides.” But platforming “both sides” implies we live in an already equal world. We don’t. And that’s a fact. ●

BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.


 


“My dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a key role in punishing me — ma’am, they should be in jail,” Spears told the judge in June. “This conservatorship has allowed my dad to ruin my life. Advertisement     “I would honestly like to sue my family, to be totally honest with you,” she said. “I want to be able to be heard on what they did to me by making me keep this in for so long.”Jamie has repeatedly claimed that he only wants what’s “best” for his daughter while vehemently denying all allegations of conservatorship abuse.
 


Presumably quoting the tons of praise written online about her legacy, Spears noted that she’s a “multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning pop icon,” with “nearly 100 million records sold worldwide.”“Spears has sold 33.6 million albums in the U.S. and ranks as the 18th-best selling album artist in the Nielsen era,” the caption continued. “Her songs have drawn 25 billion in cumulative radio airplay audience and 2.6 billion on-demand U.S. audio and video streams combined and she’s sold 39.8 million singles.”
 


“Yes … I will be my own cheerleader … why ???? I’m here to remind my white ‘classy’ family that I haven’t forgotten what they did to me nor will I ever forget,” she added.
 


According to the filings, Jamie and his legal team maintained that the payment would be “necessary” to ensure that the outstanding financial arrangements of the conservatorship “can be wound up quickly and efficiently.”And as Variety reported, Jamie’s legal counsel, Alex Weingarten, charges a rate of approximately $1,200 per hour.
 


Rosengart added, “[Spears] poignantly testified about the pain her father caused her and this only adds to it. This is not what a father who loves his daughter does.”

2021 was stressful. No kidding. The staff here at BuzzFeed News have some recommendations for what they tried at home over the last year that they actually loved and helped make life a little easier. Things like a Theragun for sore muscles, fancy face wash, a cheap dupe for fancy sunscreen, and the best workout headband for short hair. Perhaps the strongest recommendation is that two separate people tried out and swear by acupressure mats for headaches and stress.These items were independently selected by staff and they spent their own money on it.

Acupressure mat — $19.47 from AmazonI get really bad headaches periodically and generally bounce between over-the-counter medications, none of which seem to make a dent in the pain. Earlier this year I asked a neighbor with migraines if he’d had any medication successes recently, and he said, “You know what has helped? This.” I expected the link would go to some newfangled headache medicine or perhaps an herbal remedy, but instead it went to this truly odd product, a yoga mat crossed with a medieval torture device rendered in crisp white plastic spikes Somewhat inexplicably, it does in fact seem to help my headaches, and it also causes me to fall into a weird deep sleep within moments of lying down on it. (Warning: Set an alarm; I recently conked out for two hours on this thing, and my back was aflame when I finally woke up.) I have found it comforting to know that when the pain gets bad, I can just lie down on my bed of piercing plastic nails. —Sam Henig
 


Theragun Prime — $299 at Macy’sYou know what I got into over the pandemic? Running. Really original, I know. But between the stress of the lockdown and the stress of being a new father, I needed a consistent and mindless physical release.You know what happens when you run regularly? Your whole lower body starts to hurt. I tend to be skeptical of shortcuts around pain. I don’t really think you can trick the body. And if you do, I think you tend to pay for it later. But a few months after I did my first loop around Prospect Park, wracked with calf and hip pain, I caved and ordered a Theragun. Yes, a Theragun. That loud and heavy percussive massager that looks like a sex toy for German ravers.The thing works. You stick it where it hurts and then it hurts less. Doesn’t get much simpler. There are lots of things I don’t like about it. It costs too much, and when I lie on the couch blasting the tension out of my quads, my wife will sometimes cruise by and ask, “Pleasuring yourself again?” To which I say, 20 miles a week may strain my knee, but words will never hurt me. —Joe Bernstein
 


Contoured sleep mask — $18.99 at AmazonLet me start by being really honest: I cannot function with less than eight hours of sleep. I know there are a lot of freaks out there who are proud to sleep like five hours a night or whatever, but I am not like you. Sleeping is my favorite — and incredibly vital!! — hobby, so you know you can trust me, and I'm here to tell you to get this contoured sleep mask made of memory foam. It has changed my sleeping life in a way no other product ever has. The second night I used it, I slept straight through my alarm and got a full 12 hours of deep sleep, which was terrifying for the purposes of my alarm’s quality, but fantastic for my mind and body. It's pitch-black in there, but the contouring means you can open your eyes even in the mask, plus you can keep the blinds open and let the sunshine in to help you wake up once you take it off — but not a moment earlier. I also find the soft memory foam to be sort of like an extra pillow just for my eyes, and the act of putting it on when it's time to sleep keeps me off my phone and tells my brain it's time to shut shit down. I love her. —Addy Baird
 


La Prairie foam cleanser — $90 at Neiman MarcusA few years back, a Very Nice person gifted me with some travel-size products from a Swiss company called La Prairie. I knew nothing about the brand. They seemed nice. A small tub of something called skin caviar, a refining lotion, and the one standout: a tiny tube of foaming face cleanser. It smelled great — a faint hint of peppermint, maybe? (It’s pink, so maybe my brain filled in that scent on its own.) It was unlike any cleanser I had used before. It rinsed away in seconds (no soapy feel) and left my face feeling weirdly super clean. I have dry skin, and it never felt like this particular product was drying it out more — rather, it was the opposite. Really, it wasn’t like any other facial cleansing product I’ve tried (and I’ve tried lots). I only needed a tiny bit, and it lasted forever. When I ran out of all these cute little products, I had a bit of a shock. This stuff is expensive! As in, some of the products are $200-an-ounce expensive. (Ahem, $180 sunscreen, anyone?) Anyway, I was like, Welp that’s nice, now where’s my favorite Neutrogena cleansing gel? (It’s also a great product.) However, this year I found the La Prairie foam cleanser for $90. I know, that’s a LOT for a face wash. But it’s a 4-oz. tube (which, BTW, is huge by beauty product standards), and it’s lasted for months — it may even last a year. I don’t generally spend that much on beauty products, but this is the rare item that seemed like it would be OK for a fancyish gift or an occasional splurge. [Editor’s note: We found this for cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews for the seller said that it may be expired or counterfeit, which is not uncommon for high-end skincare products on Amazon or other reseller sites.] —Theresa Tamkins Advertisement  
 


Acure Curiously Clarifying Shampoo — $5.99 at AmazonI have combination hair and exercise a lot, so finding the perfect shampoo has been a lifelong journey. Acure is affordable, smells great, has a vegan formula, never dries out my scalp, and has kept my hair feeling shiny from my roots to my tips! —Nicole Fallert
 


Revlon One-Step Dryer Brush — $34.88 on AmazonIt takes less than 10 minutes for me to dry my long, thick hair with this dryer brush. It doesn't dry out my hair or scalp — and is loved by many of my friends with different hair types from curly to straight. —Nicole Fallert
 


Larq self-cleaning water bottle — $95 at LarqI don’t know about you but I am really bad about washing my water bottle. Frankly, it just doesn’t cross my mind often enough, and then I realize it’s gross and I’m embarrassed and avoid dealing with it. This is probably something I should address in therapy, but until then, there’s the Larq self-cleaning water bottle. Yes, $95 is a ridiculously high price for a water bottle — but if there were a water bottle worth such a price tag, it would be this one. Not only does this thing clean itself with a UV light inside the lid, but it is also able to filter water (with two different settings based on how much filtering the water might need). And thanks to some sort of god-tier insulation, it keeps my water cold as hell. My previous main water bottle was a giant 42-oz. Hydroflask, which was literally giving me shoulder problems from carrying it around. The Larq bottle is 17 oz., which means I’m filling it up often but also that it fits perfectly in my bag. —Addy Baird
 


Intake Breathing nose magnets — $67 from Intake BreathingI have a garbage septum that has robbed me of clear and easy breathing for decades. It interferes with my sleep, makes exercising annoying, and on occasion humiliates me in meetings or public gatherings when I suddenly realize I have unconsciously begun pulling on my cheek to stretch open a nostril. It sucks. And, yes, I should have it fixed surgically. But instead of doing that, I have relied on a bucket full of pharmacy-shelf flop-nostril countermeasures. Breathe Right's little nose strips, nostril dilators, I’ve tried them all. They have all helped to some extent, but none have given me the throw-the-windows-wide nostril opening relief of Intake Breathing’s nose magnets. These things improve on the concept of nasal strips by turning them into an inflexible and *magnetized* nose bridge that then attaches to little metal-filled bandage-y things you stick on your nostrils. Ridiculous, you say? Ridiculously ingenious. Because they are not flimsy, and they rely on the POWER of magnetism instead of the power of adhesive athletic tape, Intake opens up your airways and keeps them that way without falling off your face. Yes, I look like I have a Transformer on my nose when I'm wearing it. But I can breathe without feeling like I’m suffocating, and that’s all that matters. —John Paczkowski
 


Shakti Mat — $69 at ShaktiThe Shakti Mat is a modern-day bed of nails. It is a deeply weird synergy of BDSM and meditation — but once you get over the initial pain, it is incredibly relaxing. I have no idea how or why it works. But it was definitely more fun than the pandemic. —Tom Warren Advertisement  
 


Innisfree SPF 36 daily sunscreen — $15 at AmazonI’m old enough to have observed the frightening reality of sun damage and have been scared straight into assiduous sunscreen application. I previously tried and liked Supergoop’s “Play” everyday SPF 50 sunscreen, but at $22 it’s kind of pricey. So I looked for some cheaper options, and the closest dupe for Supergood was from K-beauty brand Innisfree for $15. It has the same texture that is moisturizing and light, “dewy” without being sticky. I have dry skin, and I don’t love the matte finish that La Roche-Posay, Neutrogena, and Sun Bum’s face options have. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Harry’s deodorant — $5 at Harry’sDo you sweat more than you’d like? Profusely, perhaps? Are you tired of spending $12-plus on “clinical-strength” over-the-counter antiperspirants that smell like your grandmother? Then check out Harry’s sweat control solutions. The company, which started out as a subscription shaving outfit, now makes a line of delightful deodorants. The scents are interesting and not at all cloying (goodbye “baby powder,” hello “stone” and “redwood”), the “enhanced sweat control” version works just as well as anything you’d buy from BIG DEODORANT, and it only costs $5. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Temple Tape sweatband – $8.95 and Temple TapeLike so many other people over the last year and change, my hair grew out a lot. Like, *a lot.* But when it came time to reenter society and get a haircut, I wanted to keep some of the volume I had picked up over lockdown. My new barber made it happen (Masako, you’re seriously the best) but three weeks after any cut, it’d run into a problem. My longer hair would start getting in the way at the gym or on a run. Some buffs I had on hand before the pandemic worked fine when I was home, but I didn’t want to be wearing some handout covered in corporate logos all the time. Enter Temple Tape headbands, which I found while looking for a headband brand I could order outside of Amazon. They’re durable, keep my hair up and sweat out of my eyes, and come in a bunch of simple colors. They’re even based in Brooklyn so I get to say I’m supporting a local business.I feel like headbands are having a moment. They’re ubiquitous on college and pro football sidelines and even Drake sported one while boxing. The appeal is easy to understand. They’re functional, but they’re also so fun to wear that I have a headband on during all my workouts now, even if I got my hair cut the day before. —Eric MorrowOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, aka Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on Thursday shared the first image of their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in a family portrait featured on their official Christmas card.The photo shows the family of four laughing as Meghan holds her daughter in her arms. Six-month-old Lilibet, nicknamed ""Lili,"" is the Sussexes' second child. Their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born May 6, 2019. As the Christmas card photo shows, Archie has inherited his father's distinctive red hair. Advertisement     ""This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa,' and Lili made us a family,"" Harry and Meghan said in their card.""As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families — from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave.""According to the card and a statement from Harry and Meghan's charitable entity, the Archewell Foundation, the couple made contributions to: Team Rubicon; Welcome.US; Human First Coalition; Humanity Crew; Paid Leave For All; PL+US; and Marshall Plan for Moms.""Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie, and Lili,"" the Sussexes signed the card. Advertisement     
 


The picture was taken by photographer (and Polish prince) Alexi Lubomirski, who also took the couples' official engagement and wedding photos.On Thursday, he shared the family portrait to his personal Instagram with a caption about his experience shooting the Sussexes.""This is one of those rare and special projects, that one is fortunate enough to be a part of,"" he said. ""To be able to continue the story of this family whom I first photographed as an engaged couple, then on the day of their wedding, as a married couple and now seeing their love manifest into two beautiful children, has been a delightful honour.""""To be trusted by your subjects enough, to open themselves up and have their connection documented and translated into an image, is one of the greatest gifts a photographer can have,"" Lubomirski wrote. ""This day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was one such joyous experience, and one that I feel extremely privileged to have been invited to capture.""
 


This year's picture is different from the family's 2020 holiday card, which was a stylized image of Harry, Meghan, and Archie with the family's rescue dogs, Guy, a beagle, and Pula, a black lab.“The original photo of the family was taken at their home earlier this month by The Duchess’s mother,"" a Sussex spokesperson told People at the time. ""The small Christmas tree, including the homemade ornaments and other decorations, were selected by Archie, and the tree will be replanted after the holidays.”Harry and Meghan have carefully guarded their children's privacy since moving to the United States in March 2020. They successfully sued a paparazzi agency for taking drone footage of their son, Archie, in the home where they first stayed in California, winning a settlement and an apology from X17, the company that took the photos and made them available for sale.In the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Meghan talked about how scared she was to pose for pictures with Archie in front of the world's press soon after he was born, the way that her sister-in-law has done with each of her three pregnancies.""I was very scared of having to offer up our baby,"" she said. The Sussexes would wait until two days after Archie's birth to appear before cameras with their son. Advertisement     
 


No longer working members of the royal family, Harry and Meghan have been able to keep their daughter away from the media for the first six months of her life.Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born June 4 at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California and weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces. She is named after her great-grandmother, the Queen, and her paternal grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales.On June 6, Harry and Meghan released a personal statement alongside the news of the birth of their child.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili,"" they said. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""

WASHINGTON – Multiple people who attended midterm strategy meetings in South Carolina hosted by a subgroup of the Democratic National Committee have tested positive for COVID-19.Between 5% and 10% of the nearly 300 attendees were infected, BuzzFeed News has learned from two people briefed on the matter.The events, hosted by the Association of the State Democratic Committee (ASDC) and DNC leadership, ran from Tuesday, Dec. 14, through Saturday, Dec. 18, in Charleston and included a mix of training sessions, meetings, and at least one reception. Attendance varied from 20 people to at times more than 100 and included state and national party leaders. Advertisement     The news comes as swaths of the nation are seeing a surge of new COVID cases — as well as long lines for tests and rolling shutdowns of businesses — as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps across the country. Even the White House announced that President Joe Biden had a COVID scare — he was in close contact with a mid-level staffer who tested positive after being near the president for 30 minutes during a flight back from an unrelated South Carolina event on Air Force One last Friday. Biden has since tested negative.The events in South Carolina included several days of ASDC sessions and a meeting hosted by the DNC executive committee on Saturday. When officials were made aware that two vendors who had been in attendance later tested positive, the DNC offered everyone PCR tests, Trav Robertson, the South Carolina Democratic Party chair, told BuzzFeed News in an interview Tuesday.On Dec. 17, DNC chair Jaime Harrison spoke at an ASDC event but stood at least six feet away at a podium and remained fully masked in front of a crowd of about 70 people, a DNC spokesperson said, who added that Harrison has since tested negative.Jason Rae, the secretary of the DNC, tested negative while at home in Milwaukee, flew to South Carolina on Dec. 16, but then tested positive on Friday, Dec. 17. On Saturday, he dialed into a smaller event where nearly two-thirds of the attendees were participating virtually. He then rented a car and drove home to Milwaukee rather than flying, according to a DNC spokesperson. Advertisement     The DNC and ASDC maintain that proper protocols were required ahead of and during the week of events.“I think, quite frankly, everybody did everything correctly,” Robertson said. “The guests were required to be fully vaccinated, wear masks indoors, and events were held outdoors when possible.”Robertson also said attendees were required to sign a document stating they were vaccinated before attending, adding that there were vaccine checkpoints and that desks and tables were socially distanced.“The guidelines that were set for this meeting are much stricter than the guidelines that the Republican governor set for the state of South Carolina,” Robertson said.A DNC spokesperson told BuzzFeed News they “sent a very small number of staff” to help support the ASDC and added that those staff members were “fully vaccinated, wore masks indoors, and met with various state chairs and executive directors in outdoor settings.” The spokesperson added that “DNC staff was not involved in the agenda or programming of the ASDC meeting beyond those meetings and a handful of presentations.”

The Biden administration on Wednesday announced that it will continue to allow millions of Americans to put off their student loan payments as the US grapples with a surge of COVID infections driven by the new Omicron variant.The move means federal student loan borrowers in the US won’t have to restart their debt payment until May 1, instead of the previous deadline of Jan. 31. Interest rates will also remain at 0% during the extension. Advertisement     “We know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Wednesday.His announcement comes amid pressure from some Democrats ahead of a tenuous midterm election cycle and as, according to the Department of Education, 41 million borrowers remain saddled with student loan debt in a pandemic that has continued to threaten a full economic recovery. Collectively, they hold more than $1.7 trillion in federal and nonfederal loans, according to the Institute for College Access & Success.Just days before the announcement, the US surpassed 50 million COVID cases and 800,000 deaths, according to the CDC. New cases rose by 27% in the last two weeks, the New York Times reported. Some cities have resumed mask mandates or expanded testing options, but the fear of getting sick, as well as rising inflation and the lagging supply chain, are threatening to reverse the year’s economic progress.About 6 in 10 college seniors who graduated in 2019 had an average student loan debt of about $28,950, according to a report by the Institute for College Access & Success. And the amount most borrowers owe has been increasing annually as a reflection of economic health and how much schools receive from state investment, the institute found. Low-income and Black students are also disproportionately burdened by loan payments — about half of Black bachelor’s degree graduates with debt struggle to make federal loan payments “even in good economic times,” a situation likely exacerbated by the pandemic, according to the report. Advertisement     “Even though it was a bit confusing … it was still the right thing to do in terms of financial impact on borrowers,” the institute’s associate director of policy and advocacy Michele Streeter told BuzzFeed News.She added that it’s reasonable for borrowers to feel upended by the way things “change on a dime” due to the pandemic and to not know if or when to make long-term financial plans.“I’m glad they are not letting [politics] rule the day,” Streeter said. “If there are conditions that warrant another extension, regardless of the political implications … I would hope they continue to prioritize that.”“This additional extension of the repayment pause will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our Administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers,” Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.“As we prepare for the return to repayment in May, we will continue to provide tools and supports to borrowers so they can enter into the repayment plan that is responsive to their financial situation, such as an income-driven repayment plan.” Advertisement     A major issue for advocates like Streeter is a lack of clarity from the Department of Education on their plans for borrowers, she said.“There hasn’t been clear communication,” she said, citing that advocates want an answer from the administration on whether borrowers who are in default — roughly 7 million — will be restored when repayments are restarted.Meanwhile, a coalition of lawmakers who had asked Biden to cancel $50,000 in student debt for every borrower lauded the extensions.“Extending the pause will help millions of Americans make ends meet, especially as we overcome the Omicron variant. We continue to call on President Biden to take executive action to cancel $50,000 in student debt, which will help close the racial wealth gap for borrowers and accelerate our economic recovery,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley said in a joint statement with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.During the extension, Biden said his administration will work to prepare borrowers for the payments to come. The Department of Education said in its statement this would come through steps such as providing billions of dollars of relief for borrowers with disabilities and helping small business owners through the Paycheck Protection Program.

It’s just before 8:45 p.m. on April 20, 2020, about a month into the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Los Angeles suburb of Westlake Village, and I’m waiting for our family’s harasser to show up.Specifically, I’m hiding in the back of my mom’s SUV, wearing a black hoodie and holding a walkie-talkie in one hand and a can of pepper spray in the other. The car is in its usual spot in the driveway of our two-story home, the second-to-last house at the top of a steep hill, just before a cul-de-sac. It’s especially quiet up here tonight. No traffic. No pedestrians. Just the star-speckled sky and the silhouettes of the Santa Monica Mountains.My pulse thumps loudly, and my body is tense with a fear I’ve never felt before. Even though the car is locked, and even though my parents are inside watching me on the security cameras, I can’t help but wonder what could happen if I cough or sneeze or, more realistically, start shaking so uncontrollably that I make a noise. Will he run? Will he come toward the car and peer through the tinted window? It’s been over an hour and he’s due any time now. I practice taking slow, deep breaths. Advertisement  Then it happens.From the corner of my eye, I detect movement among the stillness. A man emerges from the darkness, ascending our steep street. I watch in a state of adrenaline-fueled paralysis as this stranger gets closer. Thanks to a streetlamp, I have a clear view. His eyes scan our home, darting from window to window for any signs of detection. I silently plead with myself to stay calm as he passes within 10 feet of me, his gaze landing on the car’s dark rear window — the only barrier separating us. I hold my breath. A split second passes before he beelines toward our mailbox and opens it.Slowly, shakily, I raise the walkie-talkie to my lips, quivering in disbelief at what I’m witnessing firsthand after all this time. “Carole Baskin,” I say into the speaker. “I repeat, Carole Baskin is here.”Carole Baskin, of course, is the infamous feline fanatic featured in Tiger King, the Netflix docuseries that Americans have been devouring during these early days of quarantine. But to my family and me, “Carole Baskin” is the code name for a man who sows fear and inspires a revulsion not unlike what the show’s protagonist, Joe Exotic, feels for his activist archnemesis. No large cats were harmed in the making of this story, but my family and I — particularly my two younger sisters and me — were haunted night after night, constantly looking over our shoulders and often afraid to be at home. I think that gives us the right to add some levity to this dark, surreal episode of our lives. Advertisement  So tonight, while the rest of the world is wrapping up Zoom yoga classes, trying their carefully washed hands at sourdough starters, or worrying where their next paycheck will come from, my family and I have been focused on something entirely different: catching the man who has been harassing us and ending his perverse reign of terror once and for all.
 


Nonsensical notes and nude picsTo understand how my family and I wound up spending the pandemic surveilling our harasser, you need to rewind half a decade. In early 2015, I was a 19-year-old sophomore at New York University enduring my first polar vortex. Back home, my sister Brooke, 17, was starting her last semester at our local public high school, while my youngest sister, 15-year-old Summer, attended a private school. Advertisement  That’s when the first note appeared on the windshield of our white Jeep Wrangler, which Brooke had been driving regularly and which was usually parked in our driveway. The note was typed in a small, generic font on regular printer paper and wasn’t addressed to anyone in particular. Although we don’t remember the exact message, it was short, and we distinctly recall the author’s secret-admirer writing style, with its childish tone and poor grammar. The letter was unsigned and unremarkable, either an innocent gesture or a friendly prank, we figured, so we threw it out.A couple of weeks later, on Feb. 12, a second note appeared under the windshield wipers on the Jeep. Addressed again to no one, it was cryptic. It was also really creepy:Thanks for returning the picture, you don’t have straight hair anyways---I guess you don’t like red for valentines? Its all for fun and I wonder if anyone has ever made you think what is next-the anticipation is the best part- enjoy the starbucks and if you want, future gifts to enjoy?Huh? What picture was the sender thanking us for supposedly returning? And what was the gibberish about not liking red for Valentine’s Day or the bit about straight hair? And what Starbucks was one of us meant to “enjoy”? The note was unsettling enough that we hung onto it.Eight days later, note #3 appeared on the Jeep:I know you like starbucks. I got you something so you can enjoy your favorite drink or two. Its in the normal hiding spot.BTW, Happy Valentine’s Day :)SMThe references still eluded us, as did the whereabouts of the so-called “normal hiding spot,” although my family searched the perimeter of our house thoroughly. But there was a more puzzling question: Who was “SM”? We racked our brains, scoured our school phone directories and Instagram followers for a suspect with those initials, to no avail. Was “SM” just an alias? Regardless, we were now officially spooked. Summer was so petrified she started sleeping with kitchen knives hidden throughout her room.
 


A month later, the stranger took things to the next level with another letter that was accompanied by a torn-out page from a Playboy-type magazine with a picture of a nude dark-haired woman who appeared to be Latina. Not wanting to further distress our youngest sister or our already hyper-paranoid father, Brooke panicked and threw away the note, although she recounted that the message said something about the naked woman being “your twin.” This was especially confusing, considering that Brooke has red hair, Summer has blonde hair, and all three of us are white. Was this person not aware of what we looked like? Or was bewildering us all a part of some twisted game? Either way, we felt that this was no harmless secret admirer but a sexually motivated harasser. Around our house, my family refers to this person by a much more sinister term than “harasser,” but my editor wouldn’t let me use it in this story.One week later, Brooke found a box of chocolates on the Jeep. Then she found a fifth note. It was addressed to “S,” presumably for Summer.SDid you see my last note to you? The box behind the wall has something that reminds me of when we met. Interesting….SMWhat box? What wall? Who is this freak?Twice that February, we found roses on our property. Sometime around March 25, a neighbor told Summer that she’d left some babysitting money she owed her, along with one of Summer’s sweatshirts, in our mailbox. But when Summer checked, the mailbox was empty. We had our suspicions.On April 2, they were confirmed. Still curious about the “box behind the wall” and the “normal hiding spot,” my mom ventured over the wall in the cul-de-sac that separates the street from a grassy hiking trailhead, and, sure enough, there it was: a box nestled beneath some branches.Inside, she found a half-assed shrine composed of stolen belongings and childish gifts: Summer’s missing sweatshirt, the envelope of babysitting money, which had been emptied and ripped in half, a Starbucks gift card, a beaded bracelet, a college postcard addressed to Summer that we had thrown in our trash, and a sticker of Summer’s high school logo. My mom retrieved Summer’s possessions and snapped pictures of the contents but put the box back in its original spot, not wanting this person to think my sister had accepted their offerings.My parents filed a report with our local cops, the LA County Sheriff’s Department station in Lost Hills, but nothing came of it; we had neither received any explicit threats of violence nor had any leads.
 


Confrontation by the mailboxMy family stayed on high alert that spring 2015. One evening in late April, my highly protective dad was doing a routine window check when he spotted a man walking a small black-and-white dog. The man opened our mailbox, peered inside with what looked like a laser light, and then closed it.My dad darted outside to confront the stranger. “Were you just looking in my mailbox?”The guy said something along the lines of “Uh, no, there was a dog barking.”My dad challenged him, but the guy walked away. High on adrenaline and unsure what to do, my dad ducked into the house, grabbed his keys, jumped in the car, and drove along next to the guy. He looked to be a white guy in his late 40s, balding, forgettably dressed, neither tall nor short. He kept his eyes locked forward and continued briskly down the street while my dad followed him in hopes of seeing where he lived and taking his picture. But when my dad realized he’d forgotten his cellphone, he impulsively made a U-turn and sped back home. When he returned moments later, the man was nowhere in sight.Up to that point, we’d been convinced the culprit was an awkward teenager — some lonely perverted incel. We even had a kid who lived close by in mind. But this guy at our mailbox forced us to rethink our suspicions. Could this grown man truly be the creep behind all the disturbing notes and stolen items? Was the pathetic writing style all a ploy to sound more adolescent? Yet at the same time, we had nothing else to connect this guy to the shrine box or the notes; we had to consider that this was all a strange, timely coincidence. The neighbor-kid theory was easier to believe. Advertisement  But as much as we had hoped the mailbox incident was unrelated, it became harder to discount. A few days later, when my parents went back over the cul-de-sac wall to check on the box, it was gone. We had installed security cameras on our house, but all the notes and gifts ceased.For about five months.In October 2015, we found note #6. It read, in part: “Hi summer, You should work at the TK,” a reference to the Tilted Kilt, a local Hooters-inspired Scottish tavern where the women servers are scantily clad in mini kilts. Attached to the note was the restaurant's business card. To our dismay, our new motion-activated security cameras didn’t capture anything, so my parents drove to the Tilted Kilt, but that was a dead end.
 


A few weeks later, though, we had a stroke of luck. My parents were driving home one evening when my dad recognized the man from the mailbox walking the same small dog in our neighborhood. Once they’d passed him, they drove out of sight, then my dad got out of the car and inconspicuously followed him on foot. The man went inside a house less than a mile from ours. Advertisement  
 


Just a guy trying to empower womenIn order to mitigate the risk of retaliation against my family, I’ll call the man “the neighbor” or “our harasser” instead of using his real name. My editor at BuzzFeed News tried to contact him to give him a chance to respond to the information in this story, including sending a letter through a lawyer who represented him, but he didn’t reply to the messages and none of the phone numbers listed under his name led to him, either.During fall 2015, the neighbor was a middle-aged husband and father living in our town of Westlake Village in Los Angeles County. He studied at a state university and found success as a wealth management adviser to affluent families in the region. He worked at a major national bank — the one we banked at, in fact — and was recognized as an industry leader by trade publications. He was involved in a variety of local charity and youth organizations. In other words, he was a prominent figure in the community.But there was one portion of his résumé that jumped out at us. The neighbor, of all people, was affiliated with an organization dedicated to providing career and education opportunities for women and girls. The local wealth management firm he had cofounded even hosted an annual event aimed at supporting women in the community. Advertisement  How? By preying on them before they’re old enough to drive? By terrifying them with ominous notes and gifts? By taking their babysitting money? By lurking in their neighborhoods and leaving cutouts from porn magazines on their windshields?When my parents shared their findings with Summer, she didn’t recognize the neighbor’s name or picture. However, we quickly figured out that he had a child who attended her high school, though this classmate and my sister had never spoken. In other words, our harasser was...a local school dad.Even more alarming, Summer was fairly confident that she’d seen this kid when we’d been on vacation in Hawaii — not long after the mailbox confrontation but before we’d figured out his identity. We were waiting for an elevator at a hotel when the doors opened and Summer recognized the kid who got off. She didn’t take much notice of the man with the kid but assumed he was the father.That sighting, if Summer’s memory was correct, raised an eerie question: If this man really was our harasser, did he actually follow us halfway across the Pacific? Could he have pried into our bank accounts and seen that we had purchased plane tickets? Or was that paranoia speaking? Were we being completely irrational by even considering the possibility?We might never know for sure if the neighbor and his kid were vacationing in the same place as us — and, if it was them, whether it was a coincidence or his most calculated move yet. But the latter seemed too far-fetched, too next-level scary to believe, and in hindsight I think our doubts about that theory colored what we had let ourselves believe about the neighbor. Just as we couldn’t prove that he’d followed us to Hawaii, we didn’t have any solid evidence that he’d done anything more than peer into our mailbox that one time. We tried to employ reason over speculation. Maybe Summer didn’t see his kid on vacation. Maybe the neighbor really was looking for a barking dog rather than snooping in our mailbox. ​​ Advertisement  I know this all might sound naive, but at the time it made sense because, once again, everything stopped. After note #6 in October 2015, there were no more letters, no more gifts behind the wall...for four years. Maybe, we thought, it really was that teenager from our neighborhood and that he’d finally outgrown his weird obsession or went away to college. We didn’t have the answers we’d hoped for, but we found consolation in knowing that our family’s harasser had retired.Except he hadn’t.
 


A new target: meIn fall 2019, Brooke was living in Spain. Summer was enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder for a couple years, but had just returned to California with hopes of transferring to a local school and was living in the San Fernando Valley. I’d just landed a job in West Hollywood and was commuting from my parents’ house while looking for an apartment in the city. Advertisement  One night while my parents were out of town, I pulled into the driveway in the Jeep — the same one my sisters and I had been sharing for years. Our other shared car, an old Acura, was parked on the street. I noticed that one of the windshield wipers was sticking straight up. It seemed odd, but I didn’t think much of it and put the wiper down.But over the next few weeks, it happened again. And again. And again. We checked the surveillance footage, but the cameras hadn’t been activated by the perpetrator’s motion. I tried not to dwell on it, but a question burned in the back of my brain: After four years, was our harasser back? I got my answer when we found note #7 on the Acura’s windshield. It included another cutout from a porn mag, only this time the note was addressed to me. It read, in part:Tess- you are so darn cute and love watching you drive that jeep. … You are so hot. … See what you look like to me.The incident was a one-off, probably because I moved to an apartment in LA not long after. But how did this guy know I was the only sister home? It had to be the kid who lived near us, as opposed to the neighbor, who was about a mile away and out of sight.Whoever it was, we knew we needed real evidence to go back to the police. In 2020, it turned out we’d get plenty.When the pandemic hit in early March, I found myself temporarily out of a job and back in the suburbs, hunkering down with my parents for what we had all assumed would be a few dull weeks of time off. It was only a matter of days before the windshield wiper shenanigans recommenced. But neither the three motion detection cameras nor the camouflage surveillance camera we’d hidden in our front yard had captured anyone in the act.Next came note #8, this time addressed to Summer, who was still living elsewhere. It came with more porn cutouts and read:Nice to see you back from CU. I am back from BU. You still look like you did at [high school] but I know you look like this girl behind those clothes. Miss seeing you and having you near meSMA few weeks later, I was looking out a street-facing window for the nth time that night when I jumped. There he was, a man by the mailbox. Middle-aged. Balding. Walking a small black-and-white dog, along with another very large black-and-white dog. I ducked until he was out of sight, then sprinted outside. There, wedged against the top of our mailbox and directly above where the last note had been, was a guinea pig–sized rock that in no way could have materialized there naturally.It was the neighbor. And this time, the security cameras caught him. The gravity of the situation had finally sunk in. It was really him all along.Now, we just needed evidence that linked him to the notes and gifts. Armed with our first substantial lead in years and the long days of quarantine, we escalated our efforts into a full-scale covert operation.
 


Let me remind you here that my parents had already gone to the local sheriff’s station in 2015, and nothing had happened. The neighbor wasn’t yet on our radar, and the cops weren’t about to stake out our house because of a handful of gross notes and trinkets. Sure, we could’ve just gone and knocked on his door, but my dad had already confronted him once. We still couldn’t prove that he had been behind the notes. We knew we needed to give the cops an open-and-shut case.Which brings me back to the backseat of my mom’s SUV, walkie-talkie to my mouth, confirming to my parents that I’d gotten a positive ID on the neighbor, known to my family as Carole Baskin.
 


Pushing his limitsSpring 2020 already feels like forever ago. Hospitals were overflowing with the first surge of COVID-19 patients. Panicked shoppers were emptying grocery store shelves and scrambling for toilet paper. Donald Trump was suggesting we kill the virus by injecting ourselves with bleach. Advertisement     Through it all, my parents and I optimized our operation. Every night at sundown, my mom or I would drive to a side street about halfway between the neighbor’s house and ours, park out of sight, and wait for him to walk by with his dogs. We’d disguised ourselves with hats and sunglasses, and we even borrowed my grandparents’ cars so the neighbor wouldn’t recognize ours. If we saw him en route, we’d radio up to the house, giving my dad about 10 minutes to ensure the surveillance cameras were rolling. The other person stationed at home would then run upstairs to one of the street-facing bedrooms to take still photos with a zoom lens as the neighbor opened our mailbox, messed with the windshield wipers, or rummaged around in our plants. After he left, my dad would radio whoever was on lookout in the car that he was on the way back, and my mom or I would confirm what time the neighbor returned home.On one occasion, we sent Summer a letter in the mail, figuring that the neighbor was probably aching to find something related to her. As anticipated, he opened our mailbox a day or two later, sorted through our mail, and snatched up the envelope addressed to her — our first recorded encounter linking him directly to Summer, specifically, and maybe even to mail theft.On June 10, as protests over the police killing of George Floyd coursed through the country, the neighbor took a letter for Summer out of our mailbox and placed it on the Jeep. He started bringing a flashlight and would spend several moments peering into the car, presumably drinking in whatever personal belongings he could make out through the windows.Some nights, he appeared to play it cool, walking by our house without so much as looking at it. Other nights, a neighbor would drive up just as he was approaching, and on those occasions it looked as if he’d abandoned his mission, just a regular guy out walking his dogs. A few times, he took longer breaks, maybe 10 days off, and we’d worry that he knew we were onto him or that he’d quit without leaving a note. And catching him leaving a note would be vital. It was the last piece of evidence we needed on camera to prove that he wasn’t just some creep who messed with our property but the same person who had been harassing us since 2015. I imagine the withdrawals must be unbearable, though, and the neighbor would inevitably resurface to get his fix. Advertisement     Around this time, I started doing some research. I wanted to get a glimpse into how dangerous our situation might be. What I found was nightmare-inducing. I’ll spare you the academic explanation, as I’m no psychologist and I know very little about this man other than what I’ve observed. But, according to what I’d read, experts agree there are five types of stalkers, all of which have the potential to harm their victims, although few actually do. But the fifth and one of the rarest types, the “predatory” stalker, is the most terrifying. For predatory stalkers, “Stalking is foreplay; the real goal is sexual assault,” according to Psychology Today, and these people are the most likely to lead “double lives.” One study from the American Journal of Psychiatry states, “There is a troubling lack of warning of danger because they are the least intrusive stalkers, often only glimpsed by their victims.” I can't say what was in the neighbor’s head, but the possibilities running through my mind were bone-chilling.Given our mounting evidence and everything I’d read, we decided to talk with a friend of a friend, a retired law enforcement officer who lived nearby.This friend came over one afternoon. My parents began telling our story without naming names. Halfway through, she cut them off. “I know who this is,” she blurted out, and then said the neighbor’s name. My parents were stunned.A couple in our neighborhood had told her that their niece had had an off-putting experience with him a few years back, she explained. I reached out to the couple to learn the details. The husband told me they’d rarely interacted with the neighbor — they once invited him over for a party — so it was odd when they learned that he had contacted their niece, a college student, and messaged her online. The neighbor told the young woman that he was good friends with her aunt, and that he wanted to get together to discuss investments. This struck everyone as inappropriate and strange, considering that the neighbor had never met the niece, and he wasn’t close with the couple. Advertisement     The law enforcement friend promised to connect us with a detective when we were ready and encouraged us to keep collecting evidence in the meantime. Best-case scenario, she agreed, was that we actually get him on camera leaving one of his notes.Two weeks and several stakeouts later, we did. The ninth note was addressed to Summer, who by that point had moved back in with our parents.S-OMG. I THOUGHT YOU ARE A CLASSY GIRL LIKING V.S.: YOU LEFT A THONG ON YOUR FRONT SEAT. YOUR NOT THAT GIRL FROM THE [initials of high school] ARE YOU?I HAVE A “SUMMER” DEAL FOR YOU: LEAVE YOUR PANTIES OUT AND I’LL GET YOU A VS GIFT CARD SO YOU CAN TAKE MORE BACK TO BOULDER?IF YOU WANT A SUMMER FLING THEN ITS NOW IN YOUR SWIMMING POOL! LEAVE THIS LETTER AND PANTIES BEHIND THE WALL ON TOP OF STREET IN AN ENVELOPE WITH “ralphie” aka SM AND I WILL GET YOU V.S. GIFT CARDS PROMISE!HAVE A GOOD “SUMMER”LMKRalphie aka SMWe figured “Ralphie” was a reference to the University of Colorado Boulder’s mascot, Ralphie the Buffalo. “V.S.” must have meant Victoria’s Secret, the brand of a pair of underwear I’d left in the car, among other items of clothing. We still didn’t know what “SM” stood for. But it didn’t matter. We finally had what we needed: footage of the neighbor himself, leaving a note. I felt a cocktail of heightened emotions, a mix of disgust at this vile creep and glee for having caught him red-handed. Amped up on adrenaline, my dad and I stayed up late that night analyzing every disgusting detail of this new note, rehashing the neighbor’s every move, repeating, “I can’t believe we did it.”We got to work putting together what would be a 76-page PowerPoint to present to the authorities. In the meantime, we still had to watch out for the neighbor, who came back two days later, scoured the area where he left the note, then disappeared into the cul-de-sac for longer than normal. Looking for “panties,” presumably.It was around this time that my dad decided to revisit another key piece of evidence: the Starbucks card from the box. Back in 2015, my parents weren’t able to verify who had purchased it, but it was worth another try now that we had a name. My dad called the number on the back of the card and managed to confirm it. He learned the card was used for a series of transactions and then transferred to the neighbor’s Starbucks account.A few days later, on June 22, the neighbor outdid himself yet again. While slinking in front of our house, he may have heard Summer and her friends in the hot tub in our backyard. He took a few steps onto our driveway, staring through the side yard, as if he were trying to get a glimpse of the girls, or so we assumed. He then started climbing the small hill on the side of our property, where he crouched in the bushes overlooking our home. Was he about to go into our backyard?Watching the surveillance footage in real time on his laptop, my dad was about to sprint outside — but the neighbor, for some reason, began to descend the hill and head home.
 


Defining a threatAn LA County Sheriff’s Department officer told us that our work was the most impressive presentation they’d ever seen from a victim. We sent over extensive documentation, including a comprehensive timeline and 59 surveillance videos, with the footage lightly edited and time-stamped for optimal viewing. They even bagged some of the letters and porn mag cutouts to test for DNA.We were proud of our mountain of evidence. But even more so, we felt lucky. While many people were stressed about paying their rent or trying to juggle parenting and working remotely, we were safely quarantined, with the means and time to focus on building our case, a luxury other potential crime victims might not have.The department assigned our case to a detective. In the meantime, we went to the courthouse to apply for a temporary restraining order, the first step toward getting a permanent one. After a few bureaucratic speed bumps, we got it.The next day, my aunt and uncle waited across the street from the neighbor’s house until he got home. Then they jumped out of the car and served him. It didn’t bother me that his wife was there; we felt that she needed to know what he’d been up to on his nightly walks. Unfortunately, his now-adult kids were there too, which wasn’t ideal. But we needed to prioritize ourselves — our safety — over whatever family drama this man’s bad decisions and depraved actions might have incurred. Advertisement     In early August, about a week before the hearing for the permanent restraining order, we received devastating news from the detective: The district attorney’s office had declined to press felony stalking charges — or any other charges — against the neighbor.
 


I called the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to get some answers. The prosecutor overseeing the case explained that although she was sympathetic to us, we had insufficient evidence to prove that the neighbor’s actions satisfied all the requirements necessary to warrant a stalking charge — and there are many very specific requirements. For one, even though the neighbor showed up at our house multiple nights a week for months during the pandemic, he hadn’t followed us outside of our home, as far as we knew. He hadn’t made any explicit violent threats toward us, and while there is case law for misdemeanor stalking charges without an overt threat, we’d passed the yearlong statute of limitations for all the events that had occurred in 2015. And despite the glaring similarities between everything that happened in 2015 and 2020 — the notes signed “SM,” the messing with our cars, the missing mail — we didn’t have any actual video evidence of the neighbor doing these things back then, before our cameras were up and running. The prosecutor said she’d considered other smaller charges, like trespassing, but the neighbor had never climbed over a fence or gate, and we didn’t have a sign that clearly stated “no trespassing” in our front yard.Getting this far had taken a small army and hundreds of hours of our time. The idea that a stalking case could get shut down now was infuriating. It raised troubling questions: Someone savvy enough to refrain from making an overtly violent threat or hopping over a fence can evade accountability? If he satisfies a few — but not all — stalking requirements, he gets off free? And if the victim doesn’t have the time or money or family support to build a case like we did, how can they expect to get so much as a temporary restraining order, let alone actual justice? Advertisement     The detective told us the case would stay open for the time being, but we realized that getting a judge to grant the long-term restraining order was now more important than ever. It was our last hope.On the day of the hearing, the neighbor didn’t show up; only his lawyer was present. By this point, my dad had hired a lawyer too. In the hallway outside the courtroom, the attorneys, with our approval, struck a prehearing deal. The civil harassment restraining order would last for two years (as opposed to five), and the neighbor would not contest the accusations or evidence — that is, the copies of the notes, pictures of him tampering with our property, and the police report — that we included in our petition for the restraining order. We insisted that he attend weekly therapy sessions as well. Negotiating with this man seemed absurd, but at least we could move forward with some semblance of peace and security. His actions were now a matter of public record.
 


AftermathIn fall 2020, my family was contacted by a local reporter who’d gotten a tip about our story. We were ready for this chapter of our lives to end — but if the story was going to get out, we wanted to ensure they got the facts straight. I agreed to an interview, and my parents gave written statements.The community was virtually unaware that a potential predator walked among them since he had never been arrested. The neighbor could continue to hold his firm’s annual women’s event. He was free to work with youth organizations. In our eyes, our story would act as a public service announcement for others who might encounter him. Plus, with any luck, it would embolden other young women to speak out as well. Maybe, we thought, the district attorney assigned to the case would have a change of mind about criminal charges in light of new evidence or other people speaking up.The local newspaper wrote about our experience in a detailed two-part story. The neighbor declined to comment. His family must’ve been humiliated, and we felt for them. They were, after all, victims of his bad choices as well.When the story came out, social media lit up. Some sleuths at the newspaper tweeted that they might have solved the mystery of the neighbor’s “SM” moniker; they’d found a social media account of his that we’d somehow missed. There he was, clear as day, grinning widely in his profile picture. And his handle? It included the phrase “sexy mexy.”The neighbor relinquished his various board seats, according to the organizations he had been affiliated with. His firm’s website was taken down and remains that way. This past spring, the neighbor’s house was listed for sale. It sold in May, and a new family has since moved in.Not long after the article came out, Summer got an Instagram message from a young woman who said she used to live near the neighbor. Back in 2015, she said, her sister had been sent many notes similar to the ones we had received, along with other items, like a jewelry box with a “popped condom” in it. Reading about those similarities in the local newspaper story, she couldn’t help but wonder...But the story that stuck with me was more than a whisper. It happened after the police had questioned the neighbor and after the hearing — meaning that it happened while he had a restraining order against him. I saw it play out on Nextdoor, a social network for neighbors. A young woman in our neighborhood posted about a bobcat sighting, which is fairly common in and around our area. Looking at her profile picture, she appeared to be Summer’s age and had similar features: blonde, petite, pretty. And there in the comments was the neighbor, so seemingly concerned about this bobcat’s whereabouts — so undeterred by the police investigation into his behavior or the active restraining order against him — that he apparently just couldn’t help but ask the young woman a burning question: “What street do you live on?” ●

Traeger Ironwood pellet grill — $1,400–$1,600 at TragerThe Traeger Ironwood pellet grill is hands down the best thing I have tried this year largely because it is responsible for so many exquisitely smoky meals but also because I am a huge barbecue dork and this may well be the holy grail (Traeger loaned BuzzFeed a grill to review). I have yet to cook a bad meal on this thing, and I have cooked more than a few of those in the past on our former grill (RIP) — despite, say, setting multiple overnight alarms to check the grill temp on a 32-hour brisket. It’s hard to explain the catastrophic despondency and frustration of discovering that a brisket you have obsessively babied with techniques painstakingly sourced from 50 different BBQ subreddits looks and tastes like the bottom of an old flip flop. But the Traeger pellet grill has, for me, made that a thing of the past. Instead of charcoal, it burns pellets methodically fed to it by a temperature-controlled auger that capably holds a slow-and-low smoke for as long as you need it to (and has a special “super smoke” feature). And it has nailed everything I’ve cooked on it — chicken, ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, sausage — in a way that’s often inspired “this is your best INSERT FOOD HERE yet” accolades from family and friends. Honestly, I wish I’d saved up (it is not cheap), gritted my teeth, and bought this a few years ago. —John Paczkowski
 


Shipment of frozen soup dumplings from Xiao Chi Jie — $39.95 at Xiao Chi JieThis Seattle-based restaurant will mail you a packet of 50 frozen soup dumplings (xiao long bao) that you keep in your freezer and then cook drunkenly when you come home late but want to reward yourself with the most delicious food known to man. Advertisement  For the uninitiated, soup dumplings are humanity’s greatest achievement. You bite the top off, sip out the delicious filling, then consume them with the sauce of your choice. Incredible.These ones are filled with either pork, shrimp and pork, or chicken. Of course, they also sell the accompanying sauces. There’s the classic vinegar, as well a chilli crisp oil that deserves to be studied and a ginger and scallion umami source which I want to bathe in. They also sell bamboo steamers if you need one.They even offer a VIP Dumpling Program where they’ll mail you packets every month if you want, which is a truly spectacular idea for which they deserve to make a fortune. —David Mack
 


Tomato pieI had never heard of tomato pie until this summer. If you had asked me if tomato pie was a thing, I suppose I would have said yes? I don’t know. Life before tomato pie is all a blur. Here’s what I remember: going to a farmers market on the way home from a weekend at a rental upstate, being overwhelmed by the produce selection, and almost doing what I always do when overwhelmed by farmers market produce, which is buy some token non-produce item (a baked good, honey, soap) and leave, but then my husband said, “What if we buy a bunch of heirloom tomatoes and make a tomato pie?” It was such a sure-footed plan, offered up as though we had ever made a tomato pie before, that there could be no response but to buy those tomatoes and make that pie. I would provide a recipe, but I actually just googled around and cobbled together a few. The gist is this: You cut up the tomatoes and drain them a bit, you layer them in a pie crust with basil, and then you top it off with a mozzarella/mayonnaise mixture that doesn’t taste mayonnaisey once you’re done. Then you bake it. It’s basically like a fresher, tomato-first take on pizza, and it’s the best possible solution to late-summer farmers market decision fatigue. —Sam Henig
 


The Ooni Koda 12-inch pizza oven — $319 at Williams Sonoma, BloomingdalesI lusted after this pizza oven for several years before I finally bought it, and when I did buy it, it was as a Christmas gift for my dad. But playing with his forced me to pony up for one of my own. It was just too good.Here’s why:It gets really hot — 950 degrees hot. There are things for which a regular household oven is simply not hot enough, and they are where the Ooni shines.It does more than pizza! Throw in a cast-iron skillet with broccoli, or asparagus, or brassica steaks, or actual steaks, and you’ll have a fantastic meal ready in just a few minutes. Seriously: There are so many applications here. Kebabs! Naan! Branzino!The pizzas are fantastic. Truly better than any I’ve had at a restaurant. Your edges will get a bit singed, and that is not bad. I prefer a quick prebake of the crust (with continuous rotation for an even bake) before adding sauces and toppings. For an unconventional but delicious white pie, roast a big head of garlic, mash it, and whisk it into a bechamel with some fresh sage. Sub this for the tomato sauce and top with your choice of veggies. —Emily Baker-White
 


Ayako & Family Hanabi plum jam — $16 at Ayako & FamilyI choose to believe that jam can be classified as tech because my body is a machine and food makes it work. This summer, I was expecting to make up about 50% of my food intake with fruit. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t get the fix I needed; almost all the stone fruit I ate was grainy and tasteless, not at all the sunshiny flavor I craved. So I decided to make up for it with fancy jam in the fall and winter. When I say fancy, I mean that this stuff is $16 a jar. But Alessandra Gordon, a second-generation jam-maker, makes the headiest preserves from plum varieties I’ve never heard of. This jam is not at all too sweet; one spoon of the rich, dark Hanabi Plum jam on yogurt tastes like something I’d pay $15 for at a really, really nice brunch place. It’s basically saving money. Plus, once you consider that the company’s base wage is $18 per hour and the staff is all people of color and/or queer, the price feels more than right. —Estelle Tang
 


Anova steam oven — $599 at AnovaMy wife tersely refers to the Anova Precision Oven as “another of your unnecessary kitchen gadgets.” And yet, she has eaten, with great gusto, the cooked-to-perfection focaccia I’ve made in it. She has also eaten the baguettes I made in it during a baguette marathon that had me baking bread every two days for over a month. And that pork shoulder slow-cooked for 12 hours in a sous vide steam bath? She ate that too. Same thing with a *shockingly* good pizza. So sure, it’s unnecessary, and yes, it is perhaps reckless to spend $599 on an oven that cooks with steam when you already have a real oven. But steam makes for better bread crusts, and cooking sous vide gets foods at the perfect temperature pretty much without fail. And this thing kind of does it all — air-frying and baking, included — and it does it well, and you can run it from an app on your phone. If my kitchen and bank account were both larger, I’d probably buy one. (Anova loaned BuzzFeed an oven to review.) —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Honey-Can-Do herb preserver — $12.69 at AmazonAfter years of watching cilantro and basil rot in the fridge, I finally broke down and bought an herb preserver. My husband and children were highly skeptical, but the cilantro was fresh and green a full TWO WEEKS later. I enjoyed fresh cilantro on three separate dinners (if you’re wondering: guacamole, butter chicken, Vietnamese tofu, and pork). It fits perfectly in the door of the fridge, and at only $13, it’ll pay for itself in a couple of months easily. —Dao Nguyen
 


The Original Baking Steel — $119 at Baking SteelLook, I am fully aware of how ridiculous it must seem to be endorsing a $119 kitchen gadget that is essentially a piece of steel plating pulled off an aircraft carrier, but this thing has proven to be an incredible ally when it comes to baking bread, pizza — anything with a crust, really. The Original Baking Steel is just that — 16 pounds of it. And because steel retains and conducts heat more efficiently than other materials, it can pizzeria the hell out of your kitchen. The Baking Steel’s creators claim it can function as the “equivalent of a 900° wood-fired oven despite being in your 500° home oven.” I have no idea whatsoever if this is true. What I can say is that the bread and pizza I have cooked on it definitely looked and tasted like it, which is all that matters, really. —John PaczkowskiOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

235,The former Minnesota police officer’s conviction comes after 20-year-old Black motorist Daunte Wright was killed during an April 11 traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburbs when the 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department accidentally reached for her handgun instead of her Taser. The deadly accident was caught on police body camera footage that showed Potter yelling “Taser” before she fired her handgun. The judge announced the convictions on two charges: first… See more,"


I’m Australian, so I’m used to “shrimp on the barbie” and “a dingo ate my baby” jokes. I’ll even laugh politely if you gesture at my cutlery and say, “Call that a knife?” But this year, a new Aussie gag entered the fray, courtesy of the internet. Instead of the usual Steve Irwin impressions, my American friends started ribbing me for the simplest and most unexpected particularity: the way I pronounce the word “no.” Apparently, I say it “naur”; if I’m being really feisty, I say it “naurrrrrrrrrr.”In 2021, “naur” became a meme, thanks to the alchemical meaning-making of the internet. Viral tweets and TikToks spread the joke like Vegemite on toast, and before long, it was appearing in places Crocodile Dundee himself never ventured. In April, video footage of a gigantic outdoor swing went viral — you can hear a person loudly saying “no” in an Australian accent — when someone retweeted it with the disbelieving caption “i cant they really say ‘naur’ LMFAOOOO.” Various “naur” jokes ensued: “Naur” became a topic of conversation on Botched. Fans of the musician Mitski dubbed her hit song “Naurbody,” and people imagined what it would be like to get a marriage proposal rejected Down Under. (This joke about Normani — I won’t spoil it for you — is my favorite example.)In another timeline, the joke would have ended there, relevant only to Australians and people who like to be mean to Australians. But it didn’t.
 


Even before “naur” became a main character on social media, people were attempting Australian mimicry online. Actor Brian Jordan Alvarez got attention last year for his shockingly on-point version. TikToks riffing on an antipodean kids’ TV show called H2O: Just Add Water made the rounds a couple of years ago, making fun of how the performers pronounced one of the characters’ names: not Cleo, but Cleourrrrr.Suffice it to say, the algorithm was primed for further iterations. One of the earliest viral “naur” tweets was this, a proto-Joycean tragedy in miniature from 2020 about Iggy Azalea. “Iggy is in the house crying like naur....naur.... naur carti naur,” it reads. Like many online artifacts, it is almost impossible to understand without additional context. When I called its author, 24-year-old fashion consultant Chris Bridges, they said its popularity was “really random.” Bridges had dashed it off in the early hours of Christmas Day last year after seeing a tweet by the Australian rapper criticizing Playboi Carti for apparently choosing not to spend the holiday with their son. “I was just, like, bored in my house, trapped with my family. I really wanted to go out. So I was just on Twitter, drunk, tweeting,” Bridges said. “I tweeted it and I went to sleep. And I woke up the next day, and everyone was laughing.”Bridges wasn’t the first to popularize the spelling; they had seen it on Tumblr. Their tweet was a dig at Azalea and her accent, but they said they’d had some practice because of an Australian friend they like to rag on, albeit in a more loving way. “We make fun of her accent relentlessly,” they said. “Saying weird stuff she would say. I kind of got hooked on the way she would say ‘no,’ like, naur. It really sent me.”In June, Chicago-based comedian Seynique Smythe tweeted a photo of n, a, u, and r Scrabble tiles. When I DM'd Smythe to chat (“naur,” she responded at first, swiftly following up with “jk”), she said that the photo came from a real game she’d played. Her hand had made her “desperate” — when she saw the letters, she thought to herself, Can I play this? But the reason the meme had resonated at all was a pop culture reference. “I used to love the Australian show Saddle Club when I was a kid and I remember there was a character named Lisa who always said ‘no’ like that,” she said. “So when I first started seeing the meme around, it stood out because it was like, ‘OMG, other people have noticed this.’” Advertisement  
 


Typically, when people who aren’t Australian attempt the accent, they don’t do a very good job. This has resulted in horrid interpretations, like those in the “Bart vs. Australia” episode of The Simpsons and Robert Downey Jr.’s in Natural Born Killers.But the Australian accent isn’t uniform across the country. Sydney-based dialect coach Victoria Mielewska has worked with Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, and Elisabeth Moss on perfecting their Australian diction. “Australia is such a melting pot — there are so many different accents. It's hard to actually say [any] is the absolute one,” Mielewska said. But generally speaking, there are common elements that are difficult to imitate yet tempting to lampoon. As former director of the Australian National Dictionary Centre Bruce Moore laid out in the 2007 book Talking and Listening in the Age of Modernity, they include a nasal quality, flat intonation, and a drawl.“If you're British or American, a lot of your accent is based on musculature in the mouth,” Mielewska said. “They're very muscular accents. When you go into Australian, you really relax the tone and the soft palate. So it's actually asking [non-Australian] actors to undo what is inherent and habitual with their own accent. And that's why it's so hard ... you have to have a certain amount of vulnerability, and allow that exposure of this new accent to come through.” Advertisement  “Naur” is an unusual instance of non-Australians actually managing to sound Australian, albeit in an exaggerated way. So what accounts for the way Australians say “no”? Mielewska said the word actually “has a fairly tight musculature” compared to other Australian-accented words. To get “that unique Australian sound,” she said, the lips round toward the end of the word, and the tongue bulks up to make that “r” sound. Her tips for nailing it are to put “no” and “ur” together, stretching out the sounds, and not to stay on the same note throughout the word. “Be definitive about it,” she said.Crystal Abidin, an associate professor of internet studies at Perth’s Curtin University, said that online jokes about Australian accents have been around for much longer than, say, TikTok has. “[The letters] ‘n’ and ‘o’ becoming like a 12-letter ‘no’ was definitely one of the viral things I saw on Australian Tumblr from as early as 2008, 2009,” she told me. “But I would say the mainstreaming of Australian vernacular, in general, really took off internationally on Facebook pages.” One category of early Facebook memes compared Australia to other countries, usually in a self-deprecating way. “Like, ‘China has Phoenixes; we've got bin chickens.’”
 


The repository Know Your Meme recognized “naur” with its own entry in July 2021. According to Google Trends, “naur” hit its peak online in late September. While the accent jokes kept coming, “naur” began to be used on its own, as a cartoonish, emphasized version of “no.” How did it make the jump? As linguist Gretchen McCulloch puts it in her 2019 book Because Internet, a meme “isn’t just something popular, a video or image or phrase that goes viral. It’s something that’s remade and recombined, spreading as an atom of internet culture.”In this case, “naur” spread further still thanks to K-pop fans who noticed that stars like BlackPink member Rosé and Stray Kids’ Bang Chan and Felix, who all have Australian roots, pronounced it that way. “The ‘naur’ meme has received a lot of acknowledgment, reciprocity, and feedback from the K-pop stars themselves,” said Abidin, who added that BlackPink members have used it playfully with each other during interviews. All of this has the effect of entrenching it as part of the relationship between fandom and stars. “It absorbed into K-pop, transcended fandom, and is known by the stars too, which really has a major effect in disseminating the visibility of the meme to a larger, broader international audience as well.”Now, it basically seems to be an accepted word for Gen Z on TikTok and Twitter. That probably wasn’t an organic outcome, Abidin said. “It is often the case that on platforms, especially like Twitter, this kind of meme that has only a very niche social capital becomes a mainstay of the platform, even if nobody understands it. It goes out of its silo, takes on a life of its own, and it becomes ingrained as part of pop culture in general. And this has to do with K-pop fans strategically trying to groom algorithms into registering what they do as trends.”I’d dreamt up a theory, shoddily constructed around the cultural prevalence of Hemsworth brothers and K-pop stars like Rosé, that the accent was coming into its own. But maybe not. Unfortunately, it seemed like my accent had become part of the landscape not, as I’d hoped, because of some global agreement that the Australian accent was a mellifluous joy, heretofore unappreciated, but because 1) people were making fun of it and 2) there had likely been a concerted digital effort.Embarrassed about the wishful thinking, I figured that I was predisposed to think fondly of the meme mostly because I was an expat, nostalgically pining for the sounds I grew up with. But it had also seemed to mark some kind of change in how other people saw the Australian accent. It used to be the butt of the joke rather than something that could bring a bunch of different people together, and this was the first time I could remember non-Australians using it to communicate and laugh with me, rather than just wielding it at me.Were locals enjoying the gag as well? Abidin reminded me of the concept of “cultural cringe,” an all-Australian skepticism toward homegrown cultural products, which might well apply to a joke that made fun of the way most of us talk.But according to Michelle Rennex, a senior writer at Australian culture website Junkee and one of the first people to cover the “naur” meme, that wasn’t the case. “No Aussie is actually offended by anyone coming up to us and saying ‘naur,’” she told me via email. “The good thing about Australians is that we know how to take a joke.” Rennex said she loved the meme; her favorite iteration is this reference to the Saw movie franchise. “I often make my accent extra thick to get my point across. It’s common for Australians to make fun of the different types of Aussie accents. But while we might not all normally say naur in such a thick accent, there’s definitely a trace of naur in all of us.”Honestly, I love “naur.” It may seem bizarre to contemplate it so seriously, but I really do think about it all the time. Maybe that’s because it is so ridiculous, an utterance that instantly clears my brain and turns me into an Australian Girl Doll: no thoughts, just naur.Yet it’s obvious why this otherwise trivial meme has stuck with me all year. I live in New York and thanks to the various travel complications caused by COVID-19, I likely won’t see the Southern Hemisphere for some time. I’m homesick and grateful to have my national identity recognized and played with while I’m so far from home, even if it’s because of something as quotidian as the way I speak. “People enjoy listening to it, and people are fascinated by it,” Mielewska told me, before she said something that made me feel really happy and, well, heard. “It’s welcoming, it’s open, it’s personable. I think people really warm to the Australian accent a great deal.” ●

Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner Advertisement  
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

An Omicron-fueled coronavirus surge in places like New York and Miami have cities across the US scrambling to avoid similar fates as the federal government ramps up its own testing infrastructure. Experts, though, warn it could already be too late.The Omicron variant now makes up an estimated 73% COVID-19 cases as of last Friday, according to data from the CDC released on Monday. That’s up from 12.6% the week before and just 0.7% two weeks ago. Advertisement     Federal COVID-19 case data collected by University of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi show the sharpest percentage increases in weekly cases were in Florida and Hawaii, two states that saw early Omicron outbreaks; Omicron caused 80% of the cases in Miami last week. Both the mayor-elect of Pittsburgh and the mayor-elect of Atlanta reported they tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday.“This spreads so fast that if you look at what's going on today, it's actually already happened 10 to 14 days ago,” said epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim of the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, who spoke at a Harvard Medical School briefing on Monday. “Time is not on your side.”With the world already grappling with the delta variant, scientists are racing to understand how the rapid spread of Omicron could affect the global health crisis that the pandemic sparked in March.
 


The CDC is calling for people to get vaccinated or boosted, wear masks indoors, and test themselves before attending holiday gatherings. But the increased demand is posing challenges.In New York City, where Omicron already accounts for 92% of cases and case numbers are breaking records every day, residents wait in line for hours and scour pharmacies for rapid tests. Denver and Miami also saw long lines for tests on Monday, and Daviess County in Indiana ran out of tests this weekend.Other parts of the country are trying to avoid this disaster. Cities such as Baltimore and Washington, DC, are giving away free tests in libraries. Seattle has opened a testing site at City Hall, and Santa Clara County, California, nearly doubled appointments at its largest testing facility this week, to 3,500 a day, and anticipates going as high as 5,000 a day.“A very common question I’ve been hearing is about family gatherings, especially in the weeks ahead,” said viral variants program coleader Jeremy Luban of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. Luban said testing is one of the most important ways to keep these gatherings safe, after vaccination. That makes testing centers and affordable at-home tests essential this holiday season.President Joe Biden on Tuesday laid out a plan to contend with the highly contagious new variant, including opening federally run testing sites in New York City this week. Advertisement     “I know you’re tired, and I know you’re frustrated,"" Biden said in his speech. ""We all want this to be over. But we’re still in it. This is a critical moment.""The new push will include moves to make testing more accessible to Americans, providing supplies and military medical personnel to hospitals, and setting up federal vaccination clinics, senior administration officials told reporters on a call on Monday evening.
 


The federal government has 500 million at-home rapid tests, which people will be able to access for free via a website — but not until January, administration officials said. Those are in addition to 50 million tests the administration announced earlier this month as part of its winter COVID-19 plan, before the widespread emergence of the Omicron variant.New federal testing sites will be opened in the coming weeks “based on where states and communities have pressing constraints and where the state and local public health officials request our assistance,” a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. Advertisement     The White House’s approach is based on the expectation that hospitalizations of unvaccinated Americans will increase in the coming weeks, and that COVID-19 cases across the board will rise.At the local level, public health officials are adding staff to testing centers and planning to open shuttered or new sites ahead of the wave. “Our work on Omicron is really kind of doubling down on the things we know work,” said Chris Hoff of the DuPage County Health Department in Illinois, speaking on a National Association of County and City Health Officials podcast. ICU capacity is already down to 20% in the county of 1 million people in the western suburbs of Chicago.
 


In Vernon, Connecticut, COVID-19 testing resumed in November, with steadily increasing demand since then, city communications specialist Dave Owens said. The city has also started giving booster shots, 446 last week, after pharmacies couldn’t keep up with demand.Michael Purcaro, the town administrator and emergency management director, told BuzzFeed News that Vernon has seen a 200% increase in demand for testing within the past few days. Normally, one of the city’s testing centers sees about 50 to 60 cars in an afternoon, but a few days ago, it saw 375. Advertisement     “The surge is here, and we expect it to continue for at least the next few weeks,” Purcaro said. “At least that’s what we’re planning for from an operational standpoint both in testing and vaccination efforts.”Mike Estramonte of StarMed Healthcare in Charlotte, North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that since June, his organization has planned to open dozens of winter testing sites able to see 800 to 900 people every hour and return results within two days. “It wasn’t until really the last three or four days that we’ve been staffed up to handle what we’re experiencing now and most people are getting in and out of our lines in less than an hour,” he said.The test centers will be open on Christmas, Estramonte said, adding, “COVID doesn’t take a vacation.”Nationwide demand for tests has steadily increased since early November, according to the US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey. “We also see more people reporting that they have COVID-like symptoms or that they know someone who does — those numbers are now about as high as they were during late August and September,” Carnegie Mellon University statistician Alex Reinhart said.
 


Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of COVID-19 tests: antigen tests, which look for molecules (called antigens) that are viral signatures, and more accurate PCR tests, which identify actual viral genes. Advertisement     ""The tests that are now available, the point-of-care antigen tests, are not as sensitive as the PCR test,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on NBC's Meet the Press. ""But if you do them sequentially, one or two or more, you're going to get a result that would be an accurate result.""The arrival of Omicron also makes the availability of at-home tests more important than ever, experts said. “I wish everyone in the United States could be provided with a batch of free self-tests they could use at home,” Salemi said. “Things are changing very quickly with Omicron — it’s not really good enough to test 48 hours before travel — I’d test right before I walked out the door.”However, at-home COVID-19 tests run about $10 a pop; reimbursement requires filing a claim for the 150 million Americans with insurance, under the current Biden plan.“Unfortunately, these tests remain too costly and hard to find right now,” Stanford University School of Medicine’s Joshua Salomon said in an email, “so the extra layer of protection they provide remains the privilege of people, like me, who have been able to find and afford them.”

The smashing success of Marvel’s latest superhero vehicle, Spider-Man: No Way Home, had two of our critics curious: Is it actually any good?Turns out, they vehemently disagreed. But sometimes that’s more fun, right?Below, Shannon Keating and Elamin Abdelmahmoud hash it all out: Is Tom Holland’s Homecoming trilogy a welcome expansion upon the existing Spidey-verse, or just a depressing cash grab? What can millennial nostalgia tell us about the Tobey Maguire–helmed series, which kicked off nearly 20 years ago? Does the deployment of the multiverse in No Way Home actually make any sense? And, finally, should you see it? Advertisement     Elamin Abdelmahmoud: In Toronto, where I live, new COVID restrictions due to the spread of Omicron require movie theaters to refrain from selling popcorn, candy, and drinks. Which is to say: They require movie theaters to refrain from selling joy. So what would make anyone go to the theater under such unfulfilling conditions? This weekend, the answer was Spider-Man: No Way Home. Audiences turned up in droves for the movie, helping it pull in the third-biggest opening weekend of all time worldwide, and the second-biggest of all time in the US. That’s not a pandemic-era record. It’s an all-time record. I was among these people. I put on a fresh KN95 and settled in for what I was sure would be a lesser movie experience. But it was not.No Way Home, reportedly the conclusion of Tom Holland’s tenure as Spider-Man (or…is it?), is one of the most satisfying entries into the franchise, perhaps second only to Into the Spiderverse. That’s because of its sheer scale and ambitious plot — in No Way Home, Holland’s Peter Parker attempts to fix the consequences of his actions through a time spell from Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), but his plan goes terribly wrong when the spell becomes unstable and starts pulling in Peter Parkers/Spider-Men from alternate universes (aka Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man) and all the villains they’ve fought, too.Describing a film as “satisfying” can read like shorthand for “fan service,” which has become a lazy way for franchises with big, passionate fandoms to elicit excitement without putting in the effort to write films that offer something unique. No Way Home does deliver big fan-servicey moments — when Garfield showed up, there were audible gasps in the theater — but the devastating emotional center of the film makes it far more than a simple play on nostalgia.In this iteration, after Holland’s Peter suffers a catastrophic loss, the multiverse Spider-Men show up not just to help him on his quest but to redeem themselves, too. By the time we meet Maguire’s Peter, he’s a Spider-Elder who has reckoned with his Spider-Doubts and found purpose. Meanwhile, Garfield’s Peter is rudderless and lonely, having lost himself in his Spider-Duties. These two Spider-Men share touching moments (“No, you are amazing, and I need to hear you say it,” Maguire’s Peter says to Garfield’s; Garfield’s Peter can’t quite get there, but he’s overwhelmed with gratitude to be seen). Together, all three Peters unite to resolve the central question that the previous movies have been circling but not quite answering, which is: What is Spider-Man for? Ultimately, the answer is a poignant and simple one: to help us understand and better deal with grief. That’s why No Way Home is good, actually. Shannon, what do you think? Advertisement     Shannon Keating: Totally agree that Spider-Man is about understanding and dealing with grief! But I’m not sure I agree about how well No Way Home deals with those themes.After watching No Way Home this weekend (in Mexico City, where COVID cases are currently decreasing), I went home and binged the three Tobey Maguire iterations. The first, Spider-Man, came out in 2002 (!!!!) when I was 10 years old. Almost 20 years ago. Wild. Those movies are obviously big millennial touchpoints; Maguire will always be my Spider-Man, I think. There’s a certain grittiness to the trilogy that I appreciated even as a kid.Spidey’s origin story is a dark one, but before my rewatches, I had forgotten just how dark. In Spider-Man, when Peter holds his murdered Uncle Ben’s hand, it’s not a beautiful or poetic moment; Ben is grimacing with pain and anguish. It’s pretty horrible. Then we have all of James Franco’s daddy issues with the incredible Willem Dafoe — my introduction to both actors were their roles as Green Goblin and son Harry Osborn — and the unhealthy and eventually murderous ways Harry channels his confusion and his grief.The Maguire movies are also lovely tributes to New York City. Spider-Man doesn’t just save New Yorkers; New Yorkers have his back, too. In the first movie, a proud and rowdy group rains detritus upon the Green Goblin when he’s trying to kill Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane and a cable car full of people, one of them yelling, “You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!” In Spider-Man 2, after Spider-Man stops Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from plunging a subway train into the river, he passes out from exhaustion and the passengers gently lift him into their arms, set him down, and promise not to reveal his identity — his mask had come off during the fight. Advertisement     This is all to say that I didn’t get a lot of those big, emotional beats from No Way Home, even with that one significant and sad death. I’m sure my millennial nostalgia is a part of that — an unwillingness to accept this new version of an old, beloved character. But I don’t know, man.First off, No Way Home is just…doing a lot. The multiverse is a fun concept, and it’s cute to see all these different Spider-Men united in brotherhood, but I think I preferred it when Spider-Man hewed closer to that gritty New York realism. No Way Home, though it does have its darkness, feels very Disney: shiny, wholesome, sexless.
 


This could just be a me problem, but the logic of the movie also escaped me. When Holland’s Spider-Man is trying to rehabilitate the villains from other worlds, I couldn’t stop thinking: Why are you making gigantic, fundamental changes to universes that are not your own??? We all know how tweaking things in time and/or space can have disastrous consequences! What’s going to happen when these men who were supposed to have died go home and are alive and, I guess, also nice now? Holland’s Spider-Man says multiple times throughout the movie that these guys are not his problem, which we are supposed to judge as callousness, because his Aunt May and the movie overall insist that they should be his problem. But why exactly is that the case, especially when the other Spider-Men have already dealt with them sufficiently back at home? I guess it’s a bummer that they had to die in their original universes, but as Dr. Strange says, that’s their fate. Leave the complications of other universes alone! Advertisement     That brings me to my confusion about what the movie is trying to say about being a good person, which I’d love your thoughts on, Elamin. I found it pretty goofy on both a thematic and practical, logistical level that all the Spider-Men could create perfectly calibrated antidotes that would turn their respective villains back into regular men, at which point they would seemingly be worthy of redemption. While I appreciate that idea, and would be very interested to see more superhero movies take on ideas around justice and restitution — especially if we have to live in a world where most movies are superhero movies, ugh — I felt like No Way Home handled it all so clunkily.Something I admired about 2002’s Spider-Man is that the Green Goblin wasn’t evil just because he accidentally zapped himself with jacked-up superpower juice or whatever. Norman Osborn was already a power-hungry capitalist, making oodles of money by providing the military with horrifying weapons of mass destruction. He was also an asshole patriarch who was sexist toward Mary Jane and emotionally tortured his son, which in turn led to Harry’s own descent into supervillainy. This is a bad guy! Who dies, remember, in a botched attempt to murder Peter.Not to say that Norman isn’t deserving of restorative justice — I think we all are, supervillains included — but still, it felt pretty reductive to erase these specificities in favor of promoting the idea that all the bad guys were only or mostly bad because of the way they acquired special powers. Superhero movies work best when they’re allegories for our real-life structural problems, and No Way Home’s kumbaya approach felt kinda basic and bogus to me. I know this is a movie for children, but still!EA: OK, not only is it a movie for children, it’s also a movie about children — I’m really compelled by the way that Holland plays the idealism of Peter. His “I can fix it” attitude, his desire to just resolve the matter in the simplest way (“Let’s just make the bad guys good!”) is the most kiddish thing about him, and that’s what drew me in. In his world, he’s trying to apply the morality lessons of helping everyone, and he immediately realizes he can do that with the technological tools he has access to — tools that perhaps the other Spider-Fellas didn’t. And what’s more, they work. He’s seen evidence of this. Changes to other multiverses be damned, there’s good to be done here! Advertisement     That’s not to say this viewpoint isn’t challenged — he suffers some serious consequences for trying to maintain his little-kid attitude and his Pollyannaish energy, and he’s faced with a personal crisis. I mean, Holland is ready to kill in this film, before the Spider-Elders offer their perspectives and bring him back from the edge.What unites all the Peters is that moment where they rally around the idea of great power/great responsibility. They realize they all have this in common, but it applies differently in each of their lives: Maguire realizes that his angst over the responsibility that he’s been given is not for nothing; Garfield concludes that he is his Spider-Brothers’ keeper; and Holland realizes that there is a cost to his idealism, but it is worth preserving.One thing that I think is elegant about this film is the way it handily settles the debate between who is the “best” Spider-Man by saying: Actually, all of them deal with different tragedies, and you can’t compare them but you can resolve them, so each finds some closure.SK: You’re totally right that Holland’s can-do Peter feels appropriate, especially due to his age! As much as I didn’t love this movie, I am a little bummed that Holland’s time as Spider-Man is allegedly coming to an end — I’m genuinely curious to see how his idealism would evolve over time. Advertisement     The Spider-Elders hyping each other was obviously fan service, in a way that probably would have delighted me more if I were more of a real fan, as opposed to someone who isn’t that attuned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But I do really like that idea, Elamin — that this movie is weighing in on the debate about who’s “best” by sharing the love.OK, OK, I’m starting to give the movie more credit than I did initially. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend people who aren’t MCU fans drop into this one — especially in our era of Omicron — but catch it on an airplane in a few years? For sure. ●

239,“After what my family tried to do to me three years ago… I’m here to remind my white ‘classy’ family that I haven’t forgotten what they did to me nor will I ever forget.”,"


President Joe Biden once again urged Americans to get vaccinated and condemned anti-vax misinformation on Tuesday afternoon, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads rapidly ahead of the holidays.The president said that unvaccinated people have “good reason to be concerned,” while those who are vaccinated and boosted are far less likely to be hospitalized or become seriously ill. Advertisement     While telling vaccinated Americans that they should not panic, Biden addressed the 70.6 million Americans who are completely unvaccinated on Tuesday in strong terms, telling them that their choice not to get the shots “can be the difference between life or death” for anyone they have contact with.“Your choice is not just about you. Your choice affects other people. You're putting other people at risk, the loved ones, or friends, neighbors, strangers you run into. Your choice can be the difference between life or death. The longer the virus is around the more likely the variants from that may be deadlier than the ones before.”Biden also directly cited former president Donald Trump, who told supporters on Monday that he has had a booster shot of the vaccine, despite having driven anti-science rhetoric and downplaying the pandemic during and after his time in office.""I got my booster shot as soon as they were available, and just today former president Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on."" Advertisement     The White House’s plan to contend with the crisis involves increasing federal support for overrun hospitals, making testing more accessible to Americans, and increasing vaccination resources.Biden went on to blast the spread of misinformation on social media and conservative cable television, where anti-vax rhetoric has thrived throughout the pandemic.“Look, the unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media,” he said. “You know these companies and personalities are making money peddling lies, and all that misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters. It's wrong. It's immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now.”Biden said 1,000 military medical personnel will be deployed to help hospitals around the country cope with an increase of COVID-19 patients, and that hundreds of ambulances and staff will be available to transport people from overcrowded hospitals to medical facilities with open beds.“I don’t think anybody anticipated that this was going to be as rapidly spreading as it did,” Biden said, responding to a question on Tuesday about whether the government failed to prepare for how quickly demand for tests has increased in recent days.The federal government has purchased 500 million at-home rapid tests, which people will be able to order online starting in January, the president said, in addition to the 50 million they announced earlier in December as part of their pre-Omicron winter plan. Federally run testing sites will also be set up, starting in New York City this week, and expanded to other parts of the country where local health authorities request assistance.Biden plans to continue using the Defense Production Act to assist manufacturers in producing COVID-19 tests to keep up with demand.“We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked,” Biden said in his speech.“The best thing to do is to get fully vaccinated and get your booster shot,” he said. “And no, this is not March of 2020. Two hundred million people are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more.” Advertisement

“HE DIED FOR HIS FREEDOM”FLUSHING, QUEENSNEW YORK CITY — Overcast skies quickly transformed into heavy rain as Hurricane Ida made its way up the Eastern Seabord on the evening of Sept. 1. Hongsheng Leng and his family took shelter in their basement apartment in Queens.The National Weather Service blasted out cellphone warnings about life-threatening floods, but in English and Spanish only — to get public alerts in other languages, people had to actively enroll in local programs.Around 9 p.m., the flooding forced the maintenance hole covers near Leng’s house to erupt like small geysers, one bang after another echoing through the street. Homes on the ground floor of Peck Avenue were soon under 4 feet of water; their basements were filled. People trapped outside climbed on top of cars. Police waded through the area, asking if anyone needed help — but in the night’s chaos, no one came for the Lengs. Advertisement  Leng and his family were among a growing community of Chinese Americans excluded from the “model minority” myths — stereotypes that Asian people in America are upwardly mobile, quiet, and unaffected by racism — that often dominate political discussions. Instead, they are part of a population of immigrants who arrive in America as adults only to find that the systems in place to help people out of poverty weren’t designed for them.With limited English skills and professional credentials that carry little weight in their new country, they have limited work options and often end up accepting off-the-books jobs; these positions leave them ineligible for unemployment benefits and force them to start from scratch near the bottom of the income ladder. Having spent years of their lives working in their native countries, they lack sufficient 401(k)s and pensions that allow people to retire comfortably. They bring with them no inheritance to keep them afloat or to jump-start their children’s path to upward mobility. In a country where savings accounts and emergency funds are largely dependent on employment history and generational wealth, there is little to cushion their fall through America's tattered social safety net.In New York City, a quarter of Chinese immigrants live in poverty, according to the city’s calculations — a rate comparable to that of other Asian communities in the city and elsewhere in the country. Assumptions that Chinese immigrants and other Asian diasporas thrive in the US are not merely false but damaging; community advocates say the model minority stereotype is part of the reason predominantly Chinese neighborhoods receive a disproportionately small slice of the government funding meant to support lower-income households.The result is a human toll in plain sight but often overlooked in the world’s richest nation. An older immigrant couple collecting cans to survive as a wave of hate crimes sweeps their adopted country. A middle-aged man working under-the-table jobs until the pandemic hits. An enterprising son whose entrepreneurial ambitions only set him back. Grandparents waiting in line at a food pantry discussing their dreams for the next generation. A promising student who gets into a prestigious high school but struggles to get ahead. A reunited family living in a basement apartment that fills with water when the storm hits. Advertisement  Leng, a college-educated architectural designer and painter, was already in his 50s when he arrived in the United States on a temporary visa 26 years ago. His wife Aihua Shen and their daughter Ling remained in Wuhan. He overstayed his visa and became out of status (meaning he entered legally but remained illegally), presenting him with the same employment challenges facing the more than 100,000 undocumented Asian immigrants estimated to live in New York City.Leng had a dream of opening an art gallery in the US and did not want to face the shame of returning to China unsuccessful, his brother-in-law Libin Shen said. Years passed. Ongoing health problems, which required several major surgeries, ruled out jobs in restaurants and other positions that were physically demanding. And Leng spoke little English. Over the years, he got by on odd jobs, selling his art on the street and picking up gigs at a graphic design firm. In 2004, he applied for asylum, claiming that his political activities with the Chinese Democratic Party in the US made him a target for persecution if he returned to China.A decade later, his wife and daughter joined him. They made a home below ground, in one of around 50,000 illegal basement apartments in New York City, the country’s most expensive rental housing market.
 


The family occasionally scavenged to get by. A neighbor said Leng collected bottles and cans and tried to repair and sell electronics; the neighbor was irritated when he scattered unsellable items and broken parts in front of other people’s homes. Financial struggles were not rare in their neighborhood, Flushing, one of New York’s Chinese enclaves. In Leng’s zip code, where more than 70% of residents are Asian, 1 in 4 Asian residents lives below the federal poverty line. Many are Chinese, who make up about three-fourths of the Asian population there.City records show anonymous complaints were made about the building the Lengs inhabited, for which six violations were issued. The most recent complaint, filed in 2007, indicated that the building’s garage and basement had been illegally converted into apartments, but inspectors were unable to access the property. The complaint was closed after two inspection attempts. EW Escrow, the owner listed for the property, did not respond to a request for comment.Libin Shen said his sister Aihua wasn’t forthcoming about their circumstances. “She never told us anything negative when she was in America. She always said everything was fine,” he said. “Had I known about her living condition, as her brother, I would have immediately asked her to come back.”On Sept. 2 at 11:42 a.m., after the rains receded, police responded to a 911 call. Emergency responders found a basement apartment without the requisite second exit. The two-family house had been converted into a seven-family residence, according to Department of Buildings records. A man and two women were discovered unconscious and unresponsive inside the basement of the house. EMS pronounced them dead at the scene.Hongsheng Leng was 82 years old, his wife Aihua Shen was 65, and their daughter Ling was 31.
 


In China, the Shen family did not find out about their deaths until four days later, via a community organization in the US. Libin said he fell to the ground. He had heard a storm hit the New York area, but didn’t know the family lived in a basement apartment, and it never occurred to him they were in real danger, or that the city would have experienced what he sees as a breakdown in emergency services that night.Leng “had the freedom to go to the United States,” Libin said. “When I hear of the American dream, the only thing I would like to say is he died for his freedom.”Most of the 11 basement deaths from Hurricane Ida’s historic flooding were people of Asian descent, including Chinese, Nepalese, and Indo-Caribbean families.The Leng’s apartment was soon gutted, erasing the ruins of their lives in America. On the front door of the house, a faded sign remained bearing the Chinese character “fu,” meaning good fortune and luck.“A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK IS NOT GONNA CUT IT”HARLEM
 


Before the flood, Yao Pan Ma and his wife had lost their apartment in Chinatown to a fire. It had only been about a year since the couple left their children and grandchildren in China to come to the US in November 2018. With few options, they moved in with the wife’s older parents in a housing project in Harlem, a neighborhood where residents had faced the headwinds of racism and economic hardship for generations. When the pandemic shut down the city in March 2020, Ma, who had been a dim sum chef in China, lost his job in a restaurant in Chinatown, where he cooked and washed dishes.Ma, 61, had not worked enough to qualify for jobless benefits. His in-laws, who are in their 90s, receive less than $1,000 in combined Social Security benefits, but it wasn’t enough to support all four of them. “For four people, you can scrimp all you want, but at the end of the day a Social Security check is not gonna cut it,” Karlin Chan, a spokesperson for the family and community advocate, said.So in 2020, Ma and his wife began collecting bottles and cans to make ends meet, one five-cent deposit at a time.The pandemic hit recent Asian immigrants, as well as those with no college education, especially hard. In a country where retirement incomes are far more robust for those who work jobs with pensions or 401(k) plans, older Americans without such nest eggs rely on public programs that don’t always meet basic needs. Social Security payments, which are based on a person’s earnings history, penalize people who were low-wage workers or who arrived in the US later in life. The impact of this system on older people in Asian communities in the US is clear: Asian American and Pacific Islander men earn 14.5% less in annual Social Security income than men on average, and AAPI women receive 11% less than other women on average, according to Social Security Administration reports; 11.7% of Asian people ages 65 and older live below the federal poverty line, compared to 7.3% of older white people, according to census data. Advertisement  When the pandemic hit, reports of violent racism against people of various Asian ethnicities escalated. In 2020, an older Chinese man collecting recyclables in San Francisco was taunted, attacked, and robbed in front of a crowd of onlookers as someone said, “I hate Asians,” according to a video of the incident. A year later, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old from Thailand, died after being pushed. In New York City, 61-year-old Filipino Noel Quintana was slashed across the face on the subway, and then in Los Angeles, two people beat Korean American veteran Denny Kim while yelling “ching chong” and “Chinese virus.” In March, eight people, including six Asian women, were killed by a 21-year-old man in a series of spa shootings around Atlanta.Then on a clear, warm night, around 8:15 on April 23, 2021, Ma was attacked while out collecting bottles on 125th Street in Harlem. His assailant, a 49-year-old man, was recorded on video approaching Ma from behind and knocking him down. “I am not going to let you up,” the man thought, according to a statement he later made to police. He repeatedly stomped on Ma’s head until he lay motionless and bloodied. Medical personnel transported him to Harlem Hospital Center, where they found bleeding in the brain and facial fractures.The man arrested and charged for the attack, Jarrod Powell, said in a deposition that a “Korean” man and a “Japanese” guy had robbed and maced him. He suggested that one of them was Ma. He “did not provide any details relating to the description of the perpetrators of the alleged robbery other than that they were Asian,” according to court records. The NYPD counted the incident as one of 80 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes over the first three months of 2021. Powell and his attorney declined interview requests.
 


Ma remains in a coma. Ma’s wife, too fearful to continue collecting bottles, worked as a home health aide for a few months but is unemployed again. “She’s still in shock,” Chan, the family’s spokesperson, said.When Chan last saw Ma at the hospital, months of worsening dystrophy had turned the injured man’s body frail, nearly reducing him to “a mummy,” in his words. “His chances of waking up diminish by the day,” Chan said. “Every time I go visit him, this anger, this anger just wells up in me.”In early November, Ma was moved into hospice care. His wife still plays classical Chinese opera when she visits, hoping he can hear.Seeing the disappointments Chinese immigrants around him face every day, Chan said he couldn’t help but think about their predecessors who arrived in California 150 years ago, lured by rumors of gold mountains on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. “A lot of people, when they get here, they realize that the streets are not lined with gold, they’re lined with garbage and shit,” he said.“I THOUGHT I WAS COMING TO PARADISE”SOUTH BROOKLYN
 


Two years ago, a middle-aged man named Yu found himself in Brooklyn and squeezing out a living as a contractor with a Chinese-owned business doing home renovation. He earned about $100 a day, under the table, sometimes getting consistent gigs, sometimes working just one week in a month.Yu, his wife, and their daughter had arrived in the US in July 2019 after a 14-year immigration process. “I wanted to see what the rest of the world had to offer,” Yu said through a translator. “It was really a dream to see how things would go.” The family left the southern Chinese village of Toisan — where many people in earlier immigration waves had come from — for New York, where his sister was living.They settled into an apartment near Gravesend Bay. Yu and his wife took the one bedroom and their daughter the living room. Yu, already in his mid-50s, worked part time while his wife went through the state’s required training to become a home care worker. Their daughter stepped into New York’s public high school system, not speaking any English.They had barely settled in before the pandemic began. Yu — who wanted to only be identified by his surname, fearing consequences for working off the books during that period — quickly found he was ineligible for unemployment benefits as he hadn’t reported working by that point. His wife, who had just completed her training to start work as a home aide earning $15 an hour, quit the job as COVID killed hundreds of New Yorkers daily, worried she too would catch the virus. Her voluntary resignation made her ineligible for unemployment benefits. Their daughter attended school remotely, cutting her off from the social interactions that allow a person to adjust to their new home. Months would pass in which they rarely left the house. No one made any money. Advertisement  Financial stability can be tenuous for older immigrants like Yu. Many lack the generational wealth or even emergency savings to recover from an economic setback. To survive in the short term, many work off the books at the expense of benefits they’ll need to get by in the long term. Even those who report their income may find they are ineligible for public benefits they need like Medicare because they haven’t worked here long enough, according to a 2021 paper on older Asian Americans in Frontiers in Public Health. The pandemic has further split those who lacked the means to survive the upheaval from those who had the resources to thrive.Without income, the Yu family’s rent, $1,500 per month, was now unaffordable. Their sponsor, a retired family friend who agreed to be legally responsible for supporting them as part of their immigration application, has paid several months of rent for them. But without an income or access to government relief, the newly arrived Yu family did what all people in America do when there aren’t other options: They borrowed money. The Yus have no credit history, so the loan came from family. They spent as little as possible and ate free food distributed by the local public school.
 


When the city reopened, Yu’s wife returned to work six days a week as a home attendant for an older Chinese person, but it wasn’t enough to cover their expenses, let alone catch up. Yu also found work six days a week for a Chinese-owned window manufacturer.“When I first came here, I thought I was coming to paradise, but work is harder here,” said Yu, 58. “I didn’t have to work as many hours in China; both of us are working six days a week. It’s not what I expected.”Was life in America better in any way? “The air quality,” he said.Yu said he hopes to learn English, a pursuit that is difficult to make time for when you have just one day a week off. The city offers free English-language courses, but the programs do not have enough seats to meet the demand. Some programs have waitlists. Perhaps in time, Yu’s daughter, who is now 16, will help pull the family to where they imagined they would be. Like many other students learning English, she has struggled to keep up as the pandemic closed schools for most of her first year here.“We want our daughter to be like the phoenix and the dragon,” Yu said, “soaring to the heights.”“THE PROBLEM WAS ALWAYS THERE, BUT NO ONE TALKED ABOUT IT”CHINATOWN, MANHATTAN
 


The son of immigrants who had long carried an American dream, Patrick Mock grew up to become a businessperson. He managed a Chinese bakery and supplemented his income by going to trading card conventions, where he sells Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon cards. At 27 years old, he lives in the same tenement building in Chinatown he grew up in, where rent is $700 per month.He’s struggled like many young entrepreneurs, but with none of the family wealth that helps those who succeed.“My bathtub is still in the kitchen and my toilet is still in the hallway,” he said. The building, like other tenements in Chinatown, an ethnic enclave formed as a result of racist attacks and discrimination, is full of “glue traps and rat cages.”Though his parents had come to the US to provide a better future for the next generation, Mock said, “I’m still in the low-income bracket.”Mock’s father was a chef who traveled to Massachusetts for work and came home to New York one day a week. His mother worked at a daycare until she got breast cancer. He’s spent his life in lower Manhattan’s Chinatown, surrounded by people struggling to get by — from the older people who make ends meet however they can (some by selling the gambling vouchers casinos give to those who ride their shuttle buses) to the cashiers, cabbies, restaurant workers, delivery drivers, and home health aides who make up much of the city’s low-wage workforce. “The problem was always there, but no one talked about it,” Mock said.About six years ago, during his first year in college, he borrowed money from friends and family and sold some valuable trading cards to invest in Joy Luck Palace, a Chinatown restaurant. “My mom and dad didn’t have that kind of money. So I had to ask around,” he said. “You need credit. I don't have credit. How I got my personal loans was through friends and family.” Advertisement  “When you come from nothing, every opportunity you get to rise up, you try to take it,” Mock said.The plan didn’t work.When one of the business partners left the restaurant, Mock raised his hand to take over as CEO in 2018. But he soon found huge deficits on the books; the restaurant was out of money. Just months after he took over, utility companies came to shut off the gas and power during a lunch shift. That was the end of the business. The landlord and vendors came after him for payments. Then the workers sued the owners for unpaid wages.Mock was 24 — “young and dumb and naive,” he said. He was still in college and working a side job as a roadie for a DJ company when he was served the lawsuit. “I was scared out of my life,” he said. He couldn’t afford an attorney. He still had midterms and finals. The plaintiffs won by default when he and the other defendants didn’t appear in court. The workers said this year they still hadn’t been paid. Mock was also liable for the restaurant’s unpaid taxes.Mock still dreams big. “​​One thing about the American dream is they all tell you to ‘pick yourself up, dust yourself off,’” he said.Coming to the US was a decadelong journey for Mock’s father. He left China in the 1950s when the US still severely restricted immigration from countries outside of Northern and Western Europe. Instead, he traveled to Brazil and lived there for 10 years while some 30 million people in China perished in the deadliest famine in recorded history. He eventually became a naturalized Brazilian citizen in order to bypass the US’s restrictions and enter the country in 1964, just before the US opened up immigration to people from other regions. Mock’s mother came in the 1980s as the government made deeper cuts to social programs. Advertisement  When the pandemic brought everything to a halt, New Yorkers from Asian diasporas saw their unemployment rate soar to nearly 26% during the pandemic, the highest rate among all racial and ethnic groups and more than the overall rate of 20% for the city at large. One zip code that encompasses parts of Chinatown was excluded from a city loan program for low-income areas because it also covered the wealthy, predominantly white neighborhoods Soho and Tribeca — that Chinatown’s geographic adjacency to white neighborhoods was an obstacle for business owners seeking help seemed almost emblematic of the problematic perceptions of Asian Americans’ figurative adjacency to whiteness.Chinatown was economically devastated by the shutdown. Xenophobia caused by what then-president Donald Trump called “the Chinese virus” may have kept some customers away. People without jobs filled Columbus Park; some slept on cardboard at night. Laid-off restaurant workers from other cities trickled into Chinatown hoping to find new opportunities but found none.In the midst of the city’s gradual reopening, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the neighborhood in August 2020. Mock approached the mayor on the street, asking for “more hope, more confidence.” He wanted City Hall’s help closing off streets to cars on weekends to increase seating for outdoor dining, like in Little Italy, and adding decorative lights to help create a more festive environment. But in a moment caught on video, the mayor walked off midway through Mock’s emotional plea. This brief exchange triggered a local uproar — a sign of white America’s chronic indifference toward the people in Chinatown.Mock said the community has been coming together and finding other avenues of support. After securing funding from a private donor he met through Yuh-Line Niou, a member of the New York State Assembly, Mock has been distributing meals to people in Chinatown without homes. As high-profile hate crimes drew widespread attention to the plight of Asian communities, Google and the nonprofit Asian Americans for Equality also helped fund Mock’s efforts, including installing new lights on Mott Street, a historic corridor in Manhattan’s Chinatown lined with restaurants, groceries, and gift shops. Advertisement     As the pandemic pushed him to help the most underserved around him, Mock described being among today’s “donut hole class”: a large swath of working people who are falling straight through the middle of America’s safety net because they earn too much to qualify for public assistance. Mock views his setbacks as common in America, a place that has long drawn strivers willing to sacrifice for a chance at upward mobility. “It’s the land of immigrants,” he said. “We're all running away from something, wanting something better.”“WE ARE POOR AND WE ARE OLD”LOWER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN
 


Not far from Mock’s tenement apartment, a long line had formed around the block outside of a food pantry near the Williamsburg Bridge by 10 on a warm September morning. Run by a nonprofit called UA3, the pantry serves up to 750 people per day, and almost everyone who lines up is an older Chinese person. Advertisement     One woman in the pantry line, Ge, 67, said she had just retired from her job as a home aide, for which she earned the minimum wage, $15 an hour over 27 hours per week. Twelve years ago, she was a rice farmer in southern China. Today in the US, she said, looking at the people waiting for food, “We are poor and we are old. That’s why we are here.” Like others who spoke to BuzzFeed News, she requested that she be identified only by her surname to protect her privacy. She is now trying to get by on the $540 per month she gets from Social Security as well as whatever help her daughter can offer. “I don’t even have enough to pay rent,” which is $900 per month, she said.Pantry volunteers work a fast-paced, nine-hour day hauling and unboxing heavy crates of food and pandemic supplies, such as hand sanitizer and masks. One of the volunteers, William Yu, lost his job at a community college during the summer and is recovering from a stroke. It’s harder to restart in your 60s, and Yu — who immigrated here five decades ago — is now dipping into his retirement savings to get by.
 


That morning, a procession of people — some with rolling carts marked with big corporate logos, resembling promotional swag, and some under hats and sun umbrellas — snaked down the sidewalk. Directly across the street, another line of mostly East Asian people wrapped around the block outside of a pantry run by Vision Urbana, a nonprofit that works with the area’s Latino and Asian residents. The mirrored lines kept moving through the day but never seemed to get any shorter.Some of the people using the UA3 pantry had come to the US in the 1980s, when China’s extreme poverty rate was above 80%; some came in the 1990s, when there were still some 750 million people in China living below the poverty line. Others arrived in the 21st century, as the country made a sharp turn and skyrocketed to become the world’s second-largest economy. But in a country of 1.4 billion people, millions were still left behind during this period of growth. Those who came to the US struggled without institutional support for people who come from rural areas and don’t speak English.The systemic failures harming immigrant families were clear early on to Sean Hong, a college student who is a UA3 cofounder and the son of the organization’s chair, Don Hong. He attended PS 130, a Title 1 school in Chinatown that serves a large number of students from low-income households and has an 88% Asian student population, according to federal data. Many of his classmates didn’t have computers or internet service, Hong said, so he and his father worked to raise money to buy devices for students who needed it.Another of the organization’s cofounders, Kin Wah Lee, 66, said she witnessed how institutional neglect harms immigrant communities during her 30-year career at the New York State Office of Mental Health. Patients who didn’t speak English were often misdiagnosed and held for too long in psychiatric facilities, she said. She cofounded the New York Coalition for Asian American Mental Health and urged the New York state government to meet the needs of immigrants from Asian countries. Advertisement     
 


UA3 has operated without any city government funding but obtained $10,000 from the Brooklyn borough president's office this year. Community-based organizations serving Asian Americans received just 1.4% of the city’s social service contract funding from fiscal years 2002 to 2014, according to the Asian American Federation, a research and advocacy group. AAF research and policy director Howard Shih said that language and cultural barriers contribute to a lack of awareness of public programs among many Asian immigrant communities, and that government outreach has typically been inadequate — perhaps in no small part because of false assumptions based on ethnic stereotypes. “We see the impact of the model minority myth on the availability of resources,” Shih said. “We have populations that need support and help.” Because of racist assumptions, he said, even when people do see signs of poverty, “they don't think of it as a widespread issue.”
 


This year the New York state budget included $10 million to combat anti-Asian violence and provide economic relief to Asian American communities during the pandemic — an influx of money that came after “decades of underfunding,” Niou, the state Assembly member, said in a statement. “Year after year, the AAPI community has been erased from the state budget.”One of the women in the pantry line, Chan, a perky 61-year-old, said she followed her son to the US five years ago and found work as a home attendant. She looks after two clients, one who requires 24-hour care three days each week. She gets paid for only 13 of those 24 hours because state law limits how many she can work in a day. “I only go home twice a week,” she said.Lum, an 88-year-old woman in line with a walker, said her family arrived in the US in 1985, but she and her husband and even their children struggled here. To help her kids get ahead, she spent the years watching over her five grandchildren. Lum and her husband now get $300 in monthly SNAP benefits. Their rent at the senior housing complex, which is subsidized, just increased to $300. The food pantry is essential for their survival. Like many other immigrants, she and her husband hope their sacrifices will serve as a stepping stone for future generations.“IT’S HOME”NEAR THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE
 


William Lam, 36, was one of the younger people in the pantry line that morning.Two decades ago, Lam was a student at Stuyvesant High School, a highly ranked Manhattan public school that is now a controversial symbol of the city’s unequal and racially segregated education system. The school’s student body is 72% Asian in a city where around two-thirds of public school students are Black or Latino. The majority of Asian students in specialized high schools come from low-income families, and the poverty rate among the specialized schools’ Asian students is higher than that of the overall student population in the city.Lam’s father owned a deli in Chinatown before he died of cancer when Lam was 2 years old. For the last 30 years, he and his mother — who worked as a home attendant and in school cafeterias — have lived in a housing project complex of 16-floor brick towers between the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges on the Lower East Side; 26% of residents in the development are Asian, according to the New York City Housing Authority. Rent for their one-bedroom apartment is $500 per month. Because their household’s income is low, they get a discount on their internet, phone, and TV plan, reducing their bill to $200 a month.High school was a difficult time for Lam. Classmates ""would throw paper at me,"" he said. ""They would throw chalk at me. And the teacher doesn’t do much.” He had an especially hard time in science classes. Then on Sept. 11, 2001, Lam was in gym class when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center just blocks away from Stuyvesant High School. “I heard loud noises, like airplane sounds. Fast. And loud. And a crash.” After the attack, he struggled academically and eventually dropped out. Advertisement     
 


These days, Lam occasionally works at a video game store but is supported mainly by $700 monthly payments of Social Security disability insurance, which he receives for reasons he asked not to share publicly.“It’s hard for me to find work,” he said.On an average day, Lam plays video games, catches up with friends, and watches Hong Kong dramas with his mother. “[My parents] wanted me to be happy,” he said. “They wanted me to graduate from school to get a job, of course. But there are a lot of things out of my control. Sometimes, I can’t fulfill their dreams.”Lam wants to open his own store but doesn’t have the money. His mother, who retired early after injuring her knees and is cared for by a home attendant, spends a lot of time in the apartment, where she can gaze at a nearby hospital and watch people walking by. “It’s home,” he said, adding that after 30 years, “it’s hard to imagine moving.” His mother is happy here, he said. “She said she is going to die here.” ●Jeremy Singer-Vine contributed reporting to this story.

KYIV — Falling snow clouded Marta Yuzkiv’s line of sight as she moved in formation with seven other fighters down a narrow road. Rifles at the ready and communicating with hand signals and whispers, they scanned their surroundings for the enemy stalking them in the nearby bushes.Then, without warning, an ambush came from behind the pine trees. A Russian team of saboteurs gunned down four of Yuzkiv’s comrades. She dropped to the ground. But within seconds, she was shot and killed, too. Advertisement     The fighters weren’t actually dead. The ambush was part of a series of war games held Saturday — on the grounds of an abandoned factory outside Kyiv — by veteran instructors overseeing a ragtag group of Ukrainian volunteers.Russia is massing some 100,000 troops and military equipment around Ukraine, possibly mobilizing 75,000 reservists to join them, and threatening its neighbor with another large-scale attack unless the Kremlin’s demands for the US and NATO to abandon support for Kyiv are met. And fighters like Yuzkiv fear they could soon find themselves engaged in guerrilla warfare with highly trained soldiers under Moscow’s command.“I know for sure that I will not leave Ukraine [if Russia invades]. I will not live under occupation. I will resist,” Yuzkiv, a 51-year-old doctor, wife, and mother of three who prefers gardening to unconventional warfare training, told BuzzFeed News. “I am a compassionate, empathetic person, but…” After taking a beat, she finished: “I would kill [to protect my country].”
 


The war games involving civilian volunteers demonstrate the lengths to which Ukrainians are prepared to go if President Vladimir Putin decides to attack. Such a move would be an attempt to alter the country’s increasing alliance with the West and could spark a land war of the likes not seen in Europe since 1945. A poll done this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that more than 50% of Ukrainians — some 20 million of them — are ready to resist in one way or another if Russia launches a new invasion, while more than 33%, or roughly 13 million people, would be willing to join in armed resistance.Thousands — from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv in the west — in recent months have joined the forces, which are composed of about 80,000 volunteers in 25 separate brigades, or one for every region of Ukraine as well as the country’s capital city. They gather to train one day each weekend.The fighters are civilians from all walks of Ukrainian society, including IT workers, bankers, doctors, taxi drivers, schoolteachers, shopkeepers, and more. They don hunting attire and mismatching uniforms from army surplus stores. Some of them wear sneakers better fit for the fashionable streets of downtown Kyiv than the battlefield. And not everyone has a working rifle. In fact, several wielded cardboard cutouts of Kalashnikovs at Saturday’s training.Technically, the forces fall under the command of the Ukrainian military, essentially making them part of the country’s reserve army. But that doesn’t mean the military provides them garb and gear, although officials have suggested that defense force troops could eventually be given arms from the country’s stockpile. For now, they are forced to purchase everything on their own.But what they lack in equipment, they make up for in determination.
 


Dmytro Ternovskiy, a 39-year-old physical therapist for the Kyiv Arsenal soccer club, is originally from eastern Donetsk but fled the Russia-controlled city for Kyiv in 2016. He told BuzzFeed News that he had seen firsthand how Russian warlords seized his city and brought death and despair to residents there. He joined the territorial defense force to help make sure the same doesn’t happen to Kyiv and because he was ashamed that he didn’t take up arms to fight off the Russians in 2014.“It was very embarrassing that I was not with [Ukrainian fighters] then,” he said.Ternovskiy is trying to make up for that mistake. He’s already spent nearly $4,000 USD on uniforms, a bulletproof vest, boots, an assault rifle, cartridges, ammunition, and shooting practice.Vasyl Hryhoryuk, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, has him beat. He said he’s put more than $10,000 into his own fighting kit, which includes an AR-15 assault rifle and a Zbroyar Ukrainian-made sniper rifle. “If the dudes come from [Russia] and try to tell me how to live on my land, fuck them,” Hryhoryuk said with an air of bravado as he showed off his AR-15.Hryhoryuk goes to a shooting range once a week and CrossFit and stretching courses twice a week. Every Saturday, he shows up at the abandoned factory grounds to train with his fellow defense force fighters in Kyiv. Advertisement     Hryhoryuk has some past military training; he was conscripted into the Ukrainian army in 2011, at a time when it was “wildly underfunded.”“Things are different now, These are professionals,” he said of Ukrainian soldiers. He hopes the defense forces will soon be as prepared and lethal.The Biden administration, NATO officials, and the central government in Kyiv have all said they don’t know whether Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine for a second time since 2014. But the increasingly ominous messaging from Moscow has them all on edge. Intelligence has suggested that an attack could come in late January or early February when tanks would be able to roll quickly over frozen ground.In recent days, Russian officials have warned that Moscow will respond “militarily” if the US and NATO don’t back out of Eastern Europe and pull support for Ukraine — which officials in Washington and Brussels have said will not happen. On Tuesday, Putin clearly delivered that threat himself.“If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” he told Defense Ministry officials in Moscow. “Do they think we’re going to stand by and watch?”President Joe Biden as well as the UK and other NATO countries have either said explicitly or implied that they would not deploy forces to Ukraine if Russia invaded. Instead, as a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday, they are prepared to enact “economic and financial measures, and we are prepared to consider a number of things that we have not considered in the past, and the results will be very profound on the Russian Federation, but I’m not going to go into details.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he wishes the US would be more explicit in what it’s willing to do so Kyiv would be better positioned to defend itself if an invasion came to pass. Advertisement     
 


“We know how to fight this war. Our soldiers have been fighting it for seven years,” Kuleba told BuzzFeed News in an interview last Tuesday. “But what our American and other partners can do is help Ukrainian soldiers fight this war. Which is strengthening our capabilities, supplying us with respective defensive weapons and military technologies now.”Specifically, he named American air defense and anti-missile systems as items topping Kyiv’s wish list.Ukraine’s army was demoralized and in miserable shape after decades of neglect when Russia invaded here in 2014. The country of roughly 40 million people had only an estimated 6,000 battle-ready troops. Volunteer battalions backed by oligarchs and crowdfunded by civilians filled the void but couldn’t completely repel the more powerful Russia-backed separatist forces.Today, Russia continues to occupy Crimea and control a swath of territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are combined about the size of New Jersey. Separating them from the rest of Ukraine is a 250-mile maze of trenches and bunkers from which the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists wage a war of attrition that has killed more than 14,000 people since spring 2014.After years of Western help, Ukraine’s army is now one of the largest in Europe, boasting 255,000 active-duty soldiers, 900,000 reservists, and some 90,000 paramilitary members. Washington has provided $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine’s military over the past seven years, according to the White House. Among the types of assistance are Javelin anti-tank missiles, Humvees, communication systems, and counter-battery radars, as well as military training. Advertisement     But Ukraine’s army is still not strong and experienced enough to defeat Russia if Putin unleashes the might of his military, which has over 1 million active-duty personnel and powerful ground, navy, and air forces, analysts say.As part of its preparation efforts, Kyiv is testing air-raid sirens in the capital this week and reviving many of its nearly 5,000 bomb shelters, which include its central metro stations that were built on the orders of the Soviet leadership in the wake of World War II hundreds of feet underground. (The city also published a map showing the location of the shelters inside schools, spas, bars, residential buildings, and elsewhere.) The facilities could hold more than 2 million of the more than 4 million Kyiv-area residents for several days — but not long term.Ukrainian news outlets have published stories about packing survival bags. The independent Hromadske news site painted a scenario for readers in which “the Ukrainian armed forces are resisting, but the Russians are using aircraft, rocket-propelled grenades and [other heavy weapons]. The front line is rapidly approaching your city… What to do in such circumstances?”Stick tape to the window of your home to protect against flying shards of glass during artillery attacks, it said. And gather personal documents, cash, medications, as well as supplies, like bottled water, nonperishable food times, matches, batteries, flashlights, an ax, condoms, and more. Advertisement     And then there are the Territorial Defense Forces, made up of motivated and patriotic Ukrainians like Yuzkiv, as well her husband and oldest son.Training the fighters are some of Ukraine’s more experienced veterans. Among them is Serhiy Filippov, 60, who went by the call sign “Sedoy,” meaning “gray,” for the silvery locks that frame his grizzled face. He was a major in the Donbas Battalion, a volunteer fighting force that helped turn the Russian-backed separatist tide in 2014 and 2015.
 


“These guys are motivated. They come to learn and they are ready to be the first to die for this city,” Filippov said. But he wasn’t pleased with everything he saw.Yuzkiv’s group, who took part in the ambush scenario, he said, responded poorly and slowly. He then explained a better way to deal with a surprise assault that he learned while fighting Russia-backed forces six years ago. Advertisement     Filippov believes a new offensive from Russia is likely. “Putin gave his ultimatum [to the West] and it was rejected,” he said, adding that he doesn’t see the president as a man to retreat. “[Putin] must go further. It is very difficult to stop a car that’s moving.”If the Kyiv Territorial Defense Force fighters are ready and willing to fight in a new war, they hope they won’t have to.Oleh Steshin, 47, runs a small construction firm repairing the exterior of buildings and has expertise in ascending and descending large obstacles. He was born in Soviet Uzbekistan and has family spread around the former USSR, including in Russia.Russia’s threats of invasion bring up a deeply personal fear. He worries that someday he could be looking through the scope of his rifle and see the face of his brother, who lives in Russia and could be among the soldiers sent to attack Ukraine.“Can you imagine what that would be like?” he asked. “I try not to think about this. I really hope that he won’t be on the other end.”

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O.
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well. Advertisement     Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O. Advertisement     
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M. Advertisement     
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

Nike Training Club app — free via NikeAfter a year of being noncommittal to exercising, I got serious and downloaded the Nike Training Club app (Nike made it free during the pandemic). It has hundreds of workouts, from yoga to strength training to nauseatingly painful cardio sessions, and you can go as hard or not as you want on any given day. The app also gives you “trophies” to mark milestones — three times a week, eight months in a row, Beast Mode when you’ve done five strength workouts, all of which means nothing except it may satisfy the part of your brain that craves reward. Blessedly, even 12 minutes of very light stretching is considered a full exercise on this app; when I had COVID, getting through that one was a tiny triumph for me, one that the app also acknowledged.Most importantly, Nike’s Training Club app has weekslong programs you can cycle through however many times you like, and you can feel how much stronger you’re getting the second, third time around. The app has self-care tips and healthy recipes, too, if you care about that kind of thing, but it’s best used as a workout app, not a lifestyle app. Advertisement  You may outgrow it after a year, maybe even before that. But if you’re thinking of getting serious about exercising, if you can only bear getting very sweaty in the privacy of your own home, and if you want a workout app that is good and FREE!!!!, I don’t think you can do better than this. —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


Weee — free at sayweee.comI live a decent hike away from the closest Asian grocery store, and while my local supermarkets are beginning to stock more and more of the basics I need, sometimes you need to go the whole hog. Weee brings “Asian and Hispanic” groceries to you and claims to be operational all over North America. I can't speak for that, but when the giant boxes of eel, scallop noodles, custard buns, and imitation crab arrived on my Brooklyn doorstep, I thought I would faint from happiness. The name is absolutely wild — founder and Larry Liu said it’s basically like the sound kids make when they're excited. I hope to never make that sound as an adult, but the feeling is there. —Estelle Tang
 


Seinfeld — $8.99 with Netflix subscriptionDespite my best attempts to live my life Seinfeld-free, I caved when Netflix brought on all nine seasons in October. Maybe I was bored, I was probably a little curious. But by “The Jacket” episode, something clicked, and, after years of declaring how boring and unfunny the few clips I was forced to watch were, I finally got it. Seinfeld is hysterical, it’s wacky, it’s even kind of raunchy??? These revelations shook me to my core. I’m not being dramatic when I say that of all the things I tried this year, Seinfeld is the one that changed me the most. My world expanded, I felt like someone whose life was full of possibilities, and I just can’t stop making slap bass noises now. —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


Peleton app — $12.99 per month (first two months free) at PelotonI don’t have a Peloton bike. I don’t have one of their treadmills either. But I do have their app on my phone, which I use at a gym much bigger than my apartment where both of those machines are available. Advertisement  The Peloton app is incredible. If you are someone like me who walks into a gym and just wants someone to hold their hand and tell them what to do, it’s a lifesaver.The sheer volume and variety of on-demand (or live, if you time it right) workout content is extraordinary. There are workouts set to every genre of music invented and set around specific artists. There are workouts for beginners and advanced athletes. They have strength workouts (arms, chest, butt, core) and running or cycling workouts (endurance, high-intensity intervals, tabata, hills). They have yoga you can do in the morning and meditations you can do at night. There are audio workouts you can run to outside if you are someone who hasn’t gotten sick of parks yet in the pandemic. There’s even a set of truly cursed workouts you can take on Sept. 11 when you want to run on a treadmill but also Never Forget at the same time.You won’t get the live stats or same metrics that the bougie bike owners do (although it can sync to your smartwatch), but you do get the same trainers and can thus participate in the increasingly prevalent conversations at parties where people gush about who their favorite is.Of course, everybody and their mom knows about Cody Rigsby. But did you know that Jess Sims is an even badder bitch and (unbeknownst to her) my best friend and will lead you through a 60-minute high-intensity bootcamp that will make you see the face of God? Or that Olivia Amato will be there for you on the days you want a small woman with demonic core strength to make you regret — for the duration of a 10-minute class — that you were ever born? Or that Matty Maggiacomo will run on a treadmill with you for 30 minutes and somehow be endearingly charming the whole time with not a hair out of place and will one day be my husband? No, you didn’t. But now you do. And so does he. —David Mack Advertisement  
 


Criterion Channel — $10.99/month at CriterionMy buoy through the last year has been the Criterion Channel, which has let me dig into decades of international cinema and which pound for pound has the richest and most rabbit hole–y library of any streaming service. Every time I open this app, dizzying horizons open up before me. I’ve gotten lost in Soviet sci-fi movies and French/Japanese/Czech New Wave and let time pass by with slow cinema from Belgium, Sweden, Iran, and the US.I wish it didn’t take a global pandemic for me to discover Nights of Cabiria (which woulda been great Halloween costume inspo had I thought of it before this moment) or The Seventh Seal (which whoops did not realize was gonna be a plague movie) or In the Mood for Love, but the last few months have just been lousy with new, beautiful discoveries. Advertisement  Beyond the app’s curated playlists, it’s just neat to see Barry Jenkins, Sofia Coppola, the Safdie brothers, Patton Oswalt, and others talk about their muses and favorite movies in the “Adventures in Moviegoing” series. —Emerson Malone
 


Laundry TikTok — free at @jeeves_nyI fell hard down a TikTok hole of videos of a professional dryer cleaner showing how to get stains out of various fabrics. Zachary Pozniak is the charismatic face of Jeeves, a high-end dry cleaner in New York, and in these videos he shows you in dulcet tones how to get chocolate, red wine, or tomato sauce out of anything, and offers other tips like how much detergent to use or how to make your own stain spray. Have I used these techniques? No, I’m still too lazy to do a pretreat soak for my stains. But I did buy some wool dryer balls that he recommends using instead of dryer sheets. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Barber TikTok — free on TikTokI don’t cut hair, nor do I have any real desire to learn. But lately I’ve been obsessed with barber videos on TikTok. It’s oddly soothing to watch someone who’s skilled with clippers create a flawless skin fade — buzzing off the back and sides of the head then meticulously blending it with the top to form a perfect gradient. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I like process videos. One TikTok creator, @12pell, is a New York City–based barber who specializes in Asian hair (particularly of interest to me because I’m a Filipino dude who’s been getting fades since he was a kid). Allow yourself to go down this rabbit hole. These folks are artists. —Richard Nieva
 


Audm — $4.99/month at AudmI listen to a lot of podcasts when I run. I love podcasts! But sometimes, they feel blathery and meandering and redundant, in a way that good writing never does. Sometimes, I want to listen to good writing instead of mediocre talking. And for that, there is Audm. Advertisement  I have run for hours through redwoods, happily distracted from my physical efforts by journalism from ProPublica and the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker and, yes, BuzzFeed News. Long car rides fly by when you’re listening to the Atavist. A Times Magazine feature is usually just the right length to fill the Saturday morning kitchen cleaning.This feels self-serving, because we are journalists — of course we think people should consume more journalism. But it’s an option that I think a lot of people don’t know they have! Remember, next time your favorite commentators start bloviating, you could be listening to their exquisitely edited words instead. —Emily Baker-White
 


Smartless podcast — free on SpotifyA friend had recommended this podcast to me a while ago but I refused to listen to it because I thought it would be another podcast of celebrities talking to their privileged friends. After all, the podcast is essentially Will Arnett, Sean Hayes, and Jason Bateman interviewing a mystery guest who is later revealed to be someone like Melissa McCarthy or Tiffany Haddish. But I finally gave it a try earlier this year and I laughed nonstop listening to Arnett make fun of his friend Justin Theroux's sleeveless T-shirts habit. Smartless makes you feel like you're joining a group of friends joking around with each other. It’s easygoing and fun and now I love Sean Hayes. —Eva Lee
 


The Libby app — free with a library cardThis free app lets you access ebooks and audiobooks through your local public library, making it effortless to accumulate more titles for your already mammoth TBR pile. BuzzFeed has plugged the Libby app a number of times already, but it is truly fantastic, so here we are writing about it again.While the Goodreads app will perpetually tell me that I’m five books behind my annual goal, the Libby app helps accelerate the reading process. The audiobooks download to your phone when you borrow them, so you don’t need to use data or a Wi-Fi connection to access the titles. In the last month, I’ve listened to My Year of Rest and Relaxation while on a long train ride, Annihilation on a bike ride in the wilderness, My Dark Vanessa walking around the city, The Underground Railroad on the subway, and Eating Animals reclined at the dentist’s office. —Emerson Malone
 


Department of Salad substack newsletter — free on SubstackThe Department of Salad is a newsletter by food writer Emily Nunn. It’s one of the rare, refreshing food newsletters that focuses on the love of the food instead of the personality of the food writer, and I love it. She interviews chefs and salad aficionados to get recipes from all different places — from a French salad from a New Yorker Magazine cartoonist to peach caprese, steak salad, to how to make that carrot ginger dressing you get on salad at the sushi place down the street. If you, like me, really only ever eat out so that you can steal the recipes of the place where you’re eating to make at home, then this newsletter is a voyeur’s dream into how to make the best salad of your life. —Pia Peterson-Haggarty Advertisement  
 


The Smoke Free app — free or $0.99 per week for premium at Smoke FreeAs of this writing, I can tell you that I haven’t had a cigarette in 8 months, 24 days, and 14 hours. And I feel fucking great about that. It was really hard. I quit cold turkey, but I did it with a plan that this app helped me come up with and execute. It can be a little cheesy at times, but if you too are motivated by earning little digital badges and completing challenges and logging things Smoke Free helped me a lot. And it’s kept track not only of how long I’ve gone without smoking, but how much money I’ve saved.As its name suggests, Smoke Free is free but you can also pay $0.99 per week for premium, and I really recommend doing so. The missions I got through premium every day in that first month really forced me to think through what I would do when I had bad cravings or faced a big trigger, like drinking outside with my friends. That’s what made the quit stick. —Sarah Mimms Advertisement     
 


Tribute.co group video card — $29 at Tribute.coWhen I got an email from a friend’s sister that she was asking friends to do a short video message wishing my friend a happy birthday, I was like, ugh this is going to be a pain. But you know what? It wasn’t. The sister was using Tribute.co, which is an app that makes it easy to collect a bunch of friends’ video messages and combine them into one nice longer video for the birthday girl (or whatever occasion).Sure, you could just email everyone and ask them to send you a video and edit it yourself together for free in iMovie. But you know what? That’s actually a huge pain in the ass. It requires nagging people who don’t understand deadlines and often getting people to understand things like Google Drive, which can be a total headache. Tribute.co manages all of this with an intuitive service that manages everyone’s uploads and lets you drag and drop them into a final video. It’s simple and great for a very lazy person comfortable with doing the bare minimum to celebrate a friend’s birthday. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Steezy app — $149.99/year subscription at SteezyI got bored of yoga apps during the pandemic but still wanted to move my body around. I love to dance, and am terrible at it — I have no coordination, left and right are a mystery, etc. The internet told me about Steezy, which has classes you can take from home, where you won't crash into other participants and might actually learn something. The programming starts out basic — and I mean BASIC, like shift-left-and-right, these-are-your-feet, this-is-a-beat basic, which is perfect for me, a grown adult. It’s pricey, but there are a LOT of classes on it for all kinds of dance activities so you can find what you like. —Kate Bubacz
 


Overcast.fm — free with ads or $9.99/year at OvercastApple’s podcast app has inexplicably sucked for years now. It is a nonintuitive asspain that almost seems intentionally bad by design. Overcast is the best replacement I’ve found for it. With a clean design and solid podcast management features, it’s easy to use and more importantly easy to set up and forget about. A premium subscription ($9.99/year in-app purchase) removes adds and unlocks additional features like the ability to upload audio files to your Overcast account. —John Paczkowski Advertisement     
 


Voice Intercom for Sonos — $1.99 at App Store or Google PlayWithin seconds of downloading this app, I was able to scare the shit out of my daughter bysaying “GET OUT” in my best Amityville Horror voice through a Sonos speaker in our living room. That alone makes this thing worth the purchase price, though I am sure there are many other uses for an app that lets you broadcast your voice through a Sonos system by speaking into your iPhone’s microphone. —John Paczkowski
 


Headspace — $70/year via HeadspaceI had been meditating for over three years without any guidance before I got this app. It was fine, I don’t believe there is any right or wrong way of sitting and breathing. However, after my 20 minutes of meditating, I frequently caught myself reflecting on how much of that time was spent thinking and not focusing on my breath. A friend told me about Headspace’s “Headspace 365” which has a new meditation for every day of the year. It had been working for him, so I thought I’d give it a shot! I’ve found that sometimes it’s quite lovely to have a guiding voice that helps me stay centered with my breathing and set good intentions for my day and life in general. —Derek Gardner Advertisement     
 


Forkist app — free via ForkistI struggle a lot with deciding where to eat. If I’m home, I can live off of rice, beans, and chicken, but whenever I have to make the choice outside, I take forever. I heard some college friends talk about Forkist and I downloaded it. It’s basically a food Instagram — literally just food suggestions and pretty food pictures. There are suggestions all over the country and the ratings are really easy to digest. I don’t post that much but I definitely enjoy seeing other people's quick reviews on food nearby. —Nicole Collazo Santana
 


Nike Run Club app — free via NikeYears ago, I downloaded the Nike Run Club app at the recommendation of a best friend from college who was on a thirtysomething *healing journey* that included therapy, yoga, and lots of YouTube natural hair care tutorials. I don’t remember what she said in her pitch for the app, but I do remember her talking about getting more in touch with her breathing, which sounded both mystical and a little corny. But I am easily influenced, so why not? I did my requisite handful of runs to my self-curated playlists loaded with high-energy, fast-octane hip-hop and dance music, bought a couple outfits to look cute as I did it, and then promptly quit.Fitness in general, and running in particular, always felt like a gesture toward another life rather than a commitment. And commitments were daunting. It took a pandemic for me to rethink commitment. Not as a goal unto itself, but a practice that can be as rugged and imperfect as the person who’s trying to do it.Pandemic life had forced a stillness on me that I found deeply unsettling. I was used to constant, aimless movement. Stillness forced me to reckon with everything I’d moved away from, and reconsider everything I thought I was trying to move toward. On a very basic level, I’d always wanted to become a runner, but was intimidated by the idea of running. I played sports in high school, but running was always the thing you did to condition your body for the thing you really wanted to do.As adulthood unfolded, though, I noticed that there was running and then there were runners. Runners had this magical way of moving and staying still at the same time. There they were, passing me by on Brooklyn’s Eastern Parkway, chins slightly leading their chests, thumbs resting on their middle fingers, eyes focused on a spot just ahead of them. They didn’t fight what their bodies were doing. They settled into it. They were patient. They looked calm and steady. They were, in a sense, still. Advertisement     June marked a turning point in America’s fight against COVID-19. Vaccines had arrived. Hope was on the horizon. For more than a year, my movement had been restricted by airborne pathogens and government mandates and my own endless anxiety. What would it mean for me to run toward stillness, instead of away from it?In June, I signed up to run a half-marathon the following November. I had no idea how to run a half-marathon. But there was my helpful Nike Run Club app, with a 14-week training course that included audio-guided runs from some of the world’s top runners. I’d expected the hard-charging, take-no-prisoners tone of other fitness apps I’d tried, but that’s not what I found. Instead, I virtually met coaches who preached patience.It also helped that the runs themselves were varied. There were days when my runs were 15 minutes. There were interval runs at different paces. There were bad runs and good runs and runs that I felt no particular way about at all and runs I quit halfway through. But I was running.I became a runner one afternoon in August, about two months into my program. I’d built up a tiny bit of confidence by then, managing to run once without stopping around Prospect Park, and I was at the point in my program where I was supposed to run three laps around in total. Advertisement     I was terrified, and expected to quit midway through. But something happened on the second lap. My brain quieted down and my body took over. The Nike coaches call this the moment when your training kicks in. I wasn’t thinking about running anymore.That’s when I realized that nobody runs a mile, or 10, or 26.2. They run a series of smaller races, one single step at a time. —Jamilah King
 


The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show w/ Charlie Bones — $4/month at doyou.worldI always start my mornings off with music, but I can also be terribly indecisive when it comes to what I want to listen to. I explored various internet radio shows during the last year, and haven’t looked back after discovering Do!! You!!!.Every weekday morning, host Charlie Bones streams an eclectic mix of feel-good tunes from his London apartment, mixing in plenty of ’80s favorites like Sade and Prince alongside more modern underground fare. There are recurring listener-supported segments like “Jukebox,” where Bones cues up YouTube music links from the chatroom, and “Reader’s .wavs,” where he features unreleased music submitted by listeners.Since I live in Brooklyn, I’m asleep when the show airs at 9 a.m. GMT, but by 8 a.m. I get a ping that the new episode is available in the archive via the Mixcloud app, so it feels like I’m listening in real-time. If you’re still stuck cycling through the same old playlist every morning, you can’t go wrong handing over the aux to Charlie Bones. —Ben Kothe Advertisement     
 


The New York Times Crossword Mini via the designated NYT Crossword appThe Mini crossword is a tiny puzzle that can be done in just a few minutes (or a few seconds, if you’re having a “good Mini day”). It’s a fun, quick daily distraction, but the option to add others to a shared leaderboard is what brings me back every day. Facing off against a dozen or so friends for the fastest times has been a fun way to feel connected to people I don’t see often, and has led to plenty of heated group chat banter and bragging rights over the past year. —Ben KotheOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

“My dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a key role in punishing me — ma’am, they should be in jail,” Spears told the judge in June. “This conservatorship has allowed my dad to ruin my life.”
 


BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.


 


“Payment of Jamie's attorneys' fees from the Estate is required regardless of the unsupported ad hominem vitriol lodged at him,” they added.According to reports published by Variety, Jamie’s legal counsel, Alex Weingarten, charges a rate of approximately $1,200 per hour.
 


“The conservatorship has been terminated and Mr. Spears was suspended ignominiously. Under the circumstances, his petition is not only legally meritless, it is an abomination,” it continued.Rosengart added, “[Spears] poignantly testified about the pain her father caused her and this only adds to it. This is not what a father who loves his daughter does.”
 


“I think I’m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!!” wrote Spears. “Best day ever... praise the Lord ... Can I get an Amen ???? #FreedBritney.”
 


“I shoot myself with a stick… I haven't had my pic taken by a photographer in nearly 4 years !!!!” Spears’ caption began.

In a crucial ruling, a federal judge in Washington, DC, on Monday refused to dismiss conspiracy charges against Oath Keepers and associates of the group who stand accused of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.Had Judge Amit Mehta granted the defendants’ motion, the largest and most serious of the cases against the alleged insurrectionists would likely have been gutted. Instead, Mehta, after more than six months of deliberation, issued a 49-page ruling that kept the charges intact, paving the way for the 17 defendants to face trial. Advertisement     As many as two dozen members and close affiliates of the armed extremist group Oath Keepers busted into the Capitol building in battle gear in a military-style “stack.”As Mehta noted, many of them had been summoned to Washington by a message the Oath Keepers’ leader, Stuart Rhodes, had posted on Jan. 4, urging them to “stand tall in support of President Trump’s fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup.” Some brought weapons, which they stashed in a hotel in Virginia, in case they were needed for a “quick reaction force.” And many joined an encrypted chat on the Signal messaging app to coordinate before and during the events of the insurrection.In the wake of the Capitol attack, prosecutors pointed to these and other actions as evidence of an organized conspiracy to disrupt an official proceeding, the certification of the Electoral College, which was among the most serious charges to come out of the sweeping Justice Department investigation.To date, at least three Oath Keepers who coordinated with the group have taken plea deals and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution. Another Oath Keeper who appeared to be in Washington on his own also pleaded guilty. Still, another 17 members or affiliates face decades in prison if convicted on a variety of charges. Advertisement     In mid-June, Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy veteran who was not a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers and did not enter the Capitol building but was in close contact with the group and stowed a .22 rifle at the Virginia hotel, filed the first motion to dismiss the charges.Other defendants filed similar motions and all 17 eventually joined the fight. Essentially, they claimed that the conspiracy charges should be dropped because they were vague, and because their actions on Jan. 6 amounted to First Amendment–protected free speech. They also questioned the idea that the certification of the Electoral College amounted to an “official proceeding” of Congress, and thus, any attempt to disrupt it wouldn’t count as a crime.In the 49-page ruling that included references to Supreme Court precedents and histories of legislation and Congressional intent, Mehta flatly disagreed.Noting that some of the defendants “entered with bear spray and assaulted police officers,” Mehta called their arguments “inaccurate,” adding that “their alleged conduct was no mere political protest or trespass.”After brushing aside numerous quibbles with the wording and intent of the language of the relevant criminal statutes, Mehta similarly cast aside the contention by the defendants that their activities on Jan. 6 were protected free speech. Donning paramilitary gear and supplies, barging their way past barricades and police to forcibly enter the Capitol building, and using encrypted messaging to keep their plans secret would not, he contends, be protected by the First Amendment.Because there are so many defendants in the case, and due to the huge volume of evidence presented by the government, Mehta has said he expects to try the case in two batches. The first is scheduled to begin April 19, with a second trial, if necessary, set for July 11. Advertisement

There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it.

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.” Advertisement  To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement  When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

The FBI agent who was the public face of the investigation into the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor charge of assaulting his wife earlier this year.Richard Trask, who was fired from the FBI after the July 18 incident, was sentenced to time served — two days in jail following his arrest in a grocery store parking lot after he fought with his wife in their home at the end of a night that featured a visit to a swingers party. Advertisement     Trask’s wife, appearing in Kalamazoo County court via Zoom, read a statement in which she speculated that her husband might have been drugged with the date rape drug GHB at the party or had an adverse reaction to mixing prednisone and alcohol. “This man has served and protected you for the past 20 years and the prosecution has chosen to crucify him unnecessarily,” she told the judge.In his own statement, also delivered via Zoom, Trask told the court, “I cannot recall any details of the night but I do take responsibility.” He added, “As a result of this situation, I’ve lost the only career I’ve ever known.”Trask’s legal troubles are among many complications for federal prosecutors pursuing kidnapping conspiracy charges against five men accused of plotting to spirit Whitmer away from her vacation home last fall.Trask was the agent who signed the affidavit that supported the men’s arrest on Oct. 7, 2020, and he later testified in federal court in favor of keeping the men locked up. Because he no longer works at the bureau, the government will no longer call on him to testify at the trial in the case, scheduled to begin March 8. Advertisement     Two other FBI agents central to the case, Jayson Chambers and Henrik Impola, will also not be on the Justice Department’s witness lists. They were the handling agents for a key informant, known as “Dan,” who infiltrated an armed extremist group whose members developed the plot.In August, federal prosecutors said that Chambers would not be a witness at trial. The announcement came five days after BuzzFeed News revealed that he had incorporated a security business in 2019 that was linked to an internet troll.Then on Friday, prosecutors said that Impola, who has been accused of perjury in an unrelated case, would not be called either. Although prosecutors have denied that the allegations have substance, the issue came up again in Michigan state court on Monday, where a hearing had been scheduled to review claims of entrapment by three defendants in a case closely tied to the kidnapping plot.In addition to the five federal defendants, a sixth pleaded guilty in January and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution. Eight additional men have been charged in Michigan state court for providing material support to terrorism, for a total of 14. Both federal and state prosecutors deny they entrapped the men. “We believe we have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of their guilt and will be presenting it at trial,” Assistant Attorney General John Pallas stated in Jackson County court Monday.But defense attorney Andrew Kirkpatrick, who represents Paul Bellar in the state case, said that the impeachment allegations against Impola could undermine the government’s case. “His credibility is absolutely at issue with this court regarding any entrapment motions,” Kirkpatrick told Judge Thomas Wilson. He and attorneys for two other defendants said that in light of Friday’s news, Impola would not be a witness and they needed additional time to review information about the government’s internal inquiry into the perjury claim. Advertisement     Kirkpatrick said he would subpoena the FBI for that information, and at his request, Jackson County judge Thomas Wilson granted an adjournment on the entrapment issue until late February.Impola referred requests for comment last week to the FBI, which declined to comment.In the same hearing, Wilson denied a motion by the Michigan attorney general to reinstate charges against Bellar and two other defendants of making terrorist threats. Those charges had been dismissed by a lower court in March.Wilson similarly rejected a request by the defense to overrule the district court and dismiss all charges, while granting a request to reduce bond for Joseph Morrison, the founder of the organized militant group Wolverine Watchmen, to $5,000 from $150,000. Morrison is expected to be released before Christmas. He has been in jail for 438 days.

As the Omicron variant blasts across the US, people are sharing horror stories of COVID testing access — from multi-hour wait times to frustrating surprise expenses to pharmacies sold out of rapid rests and desperate uncertainty ahead of holiday season travel.MiriYam Judd tried to get tested for COVID at an urgent care center on Friday in Hamden, Connecticut, three days after she’d been exposed to someone who had later tested positive. Advertisement     After waiting about 35 minutes in line next to “visibly sick” people, the 22-year-old was told her insurance wouldn’t cover her visit and she couldn't qualify for a PCR test because she didn’t have COVID symptoms.A rapid test would cost her $195. As a recent university graduate, the cost was too much for Judd.“I was really confused and shocked,” Judd told BuzzFeed News. “She asked if I wanted to proceed, and I told her I couldn't afford it and left. It pissed me off more than anything, because I don't understand how this is ever supposed to end if people don't have access to tests? We're told to be safe, to do what we can to mitigate the spread, but also expected to pay almost $200 for a test if we aren't yet symptomatic?”Judd ended up going back the next day and telling the staff she had COVID symptoms — even though she didn’t — just to get a test as soon as possible. Her test was negative. Advertisement     
 


Demand for COVID tests has surged as global coronavirus cases spike, spurred by the easily spread Omicron variant. Over 70,000 new COVID cases were reported in the US on Sunday.Test providers have run out of supplies or lagged behind public need, driving worried people to pay exorbitant prices for answers or simply walk away. People are confused about what kind of tests they should take, how many they need, and when they should get checked for the easily spread variants — and sharing their disappointment of positive test results received right before planned holiday gatherings.The District of Columbia reinstated its mask mandate and announced an order of more than a million rapid test kits. Cars waited in lines for up to three hours on Monday at Barnett Park in Orlando. New York City residents endured lines in brisk temperatures below 25 degrees as the city said it would distribute 500,000 at-home test kits to community organizations and 1 million KN95 masks.Iida Linkka, a student at Fordham University, documented her two-and-half-hour wait in the rain to get tested for TikTok at an EZ tent located in Midtown, Manhattan. Advertisement     The 18-year-old was advised to get tested after visiting a vaccine clinic for kids where she occasionally dresses up as a Disney character to help ease needle anxiety.Linkka told BuzzFeed News that she arrived just after 3 p.m., and around 60 people were already ahead of her.“I have been tested multiple times before, and this was definitely the longest wait time I have ever had,” she said. “I had gone to two CityMDs at first to get tested that day, but they both turned me away saying they were fully booked, so then I found this tent. I have never not been able to get tested at a place, I was shocked.”The mood in the line was “frantic,” Linkka said. She added that the huge crowds gave her the feeling the pandemic was worsening.Price has also compounded the chaos. People complained about tests costing $225 and how it’s difficult to tell what is or isn’t covered by insurance providers. An Instagram-worthy kit of 40 tests from On/Go costs $499 on Amazon. Others reported they were told at urgent care centers to wait to be seen by a physician’s assistant after their test, potentially raising the overall cost of their appointment if their insurance is billed for an office visit.For minimum-wage workers who make $7.25 in some states, it’s about half a day’s earnings to afford one at-home test, North Carolina–based activist Bree Newsome Bass pointed out in a tweet. Some people shared spending over $68 on a take-home test kit that costs around $20 at most stores; others called out frustrations over “pandemic capitalism,” the inherent delineation of who can or can’t afford to know whether they’re sick.“Driving to nine pharmacies across the city to ultimately find the last four COVID-19 rapid tests for $50 is not a good public health model and further exacerbates economic inequities, not to mention it is deeply ableist,” Natalie Johnstone, 31, of Portland, Oregon, told BuzzFeed News, who also has “long COVID” symptoms, including joint pain. “I needed access to time off, a car, cash, and a cellphone to get these tests today.” Advertisement     
 


For people desperate for answers days before the holidays, local efforts to bolster testing might not be enough. One halal truck in New York City reportedly attempted to administer PCR tests. And some raised the point that it's not clear whether the push for at-home testing is even efficient when positive or negative test results may never get reported to health officials. It’s up to people who self-test to tell healthcare professionals or local authorities if they’re sick.Dr. Ted Long, director of the NYC Test & Trace Corps, told reporters that efforts were being made to ramp up testing capacity across the city, but this week would be a “busy” one.“If there’s a line longer than 30 minutes, we’re going to offer you a home kit to take away with you,” Long said.In Boston, library branches were offering one kit with two tests for each household member, according to a tweet from Boston City Councilor Liz Breadon.The Brighton branch opened at 10 a.m. on Monday, but one resident told BuzzFeed News kits were gone by 2:30 p.m.Christine Varriale, editor-in-chief of a Boston music blog, tweeted that lines in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were so long they might need to “double loop.” It took over two hours in freezing weather to get tested, Varriale posted, adding, “I’ve been home for a few minutes and still can’t feel my hands or toes very well woo.” Advertisement     “I’d rather the @CityofBoston just open a walk in testing site in Allston instead,” Varriale replied to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment.Mia, 31, of Royal Oak, Michigan, who asked to just use her first name for privacy reasons, told BuzzFeed News she went to get tested after local authorities alerted her of a recent exposure. One local site was completely booked, so she made an appointment at another local urgent care.When she arrived Monday morning, the staff not only weren’t wearing masks but also told Mia their system had triple-booked all online appointments (BuzzFeed News has reached out to the urgent care for comment). She, and the other people waiting for appointments, would need to wait at least an hour to get tested — far longer than she could spare given her responsibilities as a full-time caregiver.“It was frustrating,” Mia said. She doesn't want to go back to an “extremely unsafe” place where the testing staff, who have potentially been exposed to positive cases, do not wear masks. She said urgency in her Detroit-area community to get tested has heightened in the past few weeks, although it doesn’t yet feel like what she’s heard of in cities such as New York.Luke Wilson of Reston, Virginia, told BuzzFeed News his roommate has COVID, and he needs a test before his Wednesday flight home for the holidays.With only two days' notice, the 26-year-old said test appointments at his local CVS and Walgreens were all booked and home kits were sold out at the six pharmacies he called. He could have driven an hour into DC to pick up a free at-home test kit from a public library -– but Wilson said he didn’t try the library option given the distance. Advertisement     His only choice, he said, seemed to be a company called Sameday Health that offered next-day booking for a $95 rapid antigen test or a $175 PCR “priority” test — even with insurance.He booked a rapid test for Tuesday and will have to drive nearly 30 minutes for the appointment. His insurance will reimburse him, but Wilson said he’s not sure the process of submitting a claim is even “worth the trouble.”“Of course I’m motivated to give up,” Wilson said. “I’m going to South Carolina. My family doesn’t care if I come there sick. I’m trying to do this for the greater good.”

WASHINGTON — It seemed like an innocuous enough update. Using diplomatic language, a White House statement last Thursday attributed to President Joe Biden said he would continue to negotiate the Build Back Better plan with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.“I believe that we will bridge our differences,” it said.But that one memo appears to have tanked negotiations and imperiled Biden’s entire domestic agenda — at least for now. The party is currently trapped in a war of words. Some Democrats are openly questioning Manchin’s integrity, while he accuses them of trying to beat him into submission. Advertisement     Policies like universal prekindergarten, subsidized child care, Medicaid expansion, child tax credit payments of up to $300 per month for parents, and funds to convert the US electricity grid to green energy may all now be sunk because of apparent hurt feelings between two longtime friends.On Sunday, Manchin appeared on Fox News to announce he is opposed to the Build Back Better plan, which would kill the legislation. He cited the cost of the bill and concerns about inflation. But on Monday morning while talking to West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval, he hinted at another reason talks broke down.Manchin referenced a statement released by the president before saying, “I just got to the wit’s end. And they know the real reason, what happened. They won’t tell you and I’m not going to.”After Herchevel pressed him, Manchin added, “It’s not the president, it’s his staff. And they drove some things and they put some things out that were absolutely inexcusable.”Attention turned to the Thursday update. On its face, it seems straightforward and it made no waves at the time. “Senator Manchin has reiterated his support for Build Back Better funding at the level of the framework plan I announced in September. I believe that we will bridge our differences and advance the Build Back Better plan, even in the face of fierce Republican opposition,” it reads.Steve Clemons, a friend of Manchin’s, wrote in the Hill Monday that the statement was interpreted by Manchin as singling out and blaming him for negotiations being delayed into next year. Politico reported that Manchin asked, in advance, not to be solely named in the statement and then snapped at White House staff when he was. Advertisement     By Sunday evening, after the Fox News interview, no one had to squint to find blame being cast. Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki released a statement accusing Manchin of committing “a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator’s colleagues in the House and Senate.”On the radio Monday morning, Manchin said he expected this. “They retaliated. I figured they would come back strong.”“They figured surely to god we can move one person,” Manchin said. “Surely we can badger and beat one person up. Surely we can get enough protesters to make that person uncomfortable enough they’ll just say, ‘OK, I’ll vote for anything,’ just quit. But guess what, I’m from West Virginia. I’m not from where they’re from where they can just beat the crap out of people and think they’ll be submissive. Period.”Throughout it all, there is confusion among everyone — even top negotiators — whether Build Back Better is actually dead. Some are throwing up their hands in frustration.Congressional Progressive Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal held a call with reporters Monday to accuse Manchin of going back on his word and alleged he had planned to tank negotiations all along. “That lack of integrity is stunning,” she said. “We cannot trust what Sen. Manchin says.”Jayapal said she is done trying to work with Manchin and urged the White House to use executive actions to implement as much of the Build Back Better plan as it can without going through Congress. “I am not going to negotiate with Joe Manchin on something that I’m not even sure he wants to do. What’s the point of that?” Advertisement     Others are holding out more hope. One Senate staffer told BuzzFeed News Monday that there is still an expectation in that chamber that talks can be salvaged in the new year and a plan supported by Manchin could pass. The White House is also vowing to keep fighting.Psaki said that Thursday’s statement released from her office was not meant to offend. “That was not intended to be directive or hurtful but to be a statement of fact,” she said.Democrats started the year by passing a bill with almost $2 trillion in COVID relief, including a child tax credit paying parents up to $300 per month per child. They followed it up this fall with a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.But now they find themselves ending the year on a low point. Provisions of the COVID bill like the child tax credit and a moratorium on student loan payments are set to expire in January. Build Back Better was supposed to revolutionize child care and youth education in America while also making major investments to fight climate change. Now Democrats are looking to the possibility of going into next year’s midterm elections having failed to deliver on their biggest promises.But Psaki continued to project hope Monday that talks can turn around. In doing so she pointed to the personal ties between Manchin and Biden, who have spent the week very publicly feuding.“They’re longtime friends,” Psaki said. “That has not changed.”

251,"For people under guardianship, like Britney Spears, the system can be dehumanizing, dangerous, and even deadly. For the professionals — who can control hundreds of people at a time — it can be very profitable.","
All three nightmares share a common cause: These people had been placed under the care — and control — of legal guardians. America’s guardianship system was designed as a last resort to be used only in the rare and drastic event that someone is totally incapacitated by mental or physical disability. In those cases, conscientious guardians can provide vital support, often in complex and distressing circumstances. But an investigation by BuzzFeed News has found that the system has grown into a vast, lucrative, and poorly regulated industry that has subsumed more than a million people, many of whom insist they are capable of making their own decisions, and placed them at risk of abuse, theft, and even death.
The #FreeBritney movement has drawn international attention to the case of Britney Spears, and wrongdoing by individual guardians has surfaced in the past, but our investigation reveals the systemic failings behind these isolated stories.

252,"“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread – whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic.”","


The success of Wordle, the game most easily characterized by the green-and-yellow square emojis that are saturating Twitter feeds worldwide, traces back to a small group of nerdy New Zealanders who were looking for a pandemic distraction.“The close ties across the country means it isn't hard for things to spread — whether that be gossip, word games, or good public health measures to keep us safe during a pandemic,” said Asher Wilson-Goldman, a public sector communications professional who was one of the first people to start tweeting about the game.New York software engineer Josh Wardle designed Wordle for his partner. Since November, its daily traffic has skyrocketed from 90 users to 2 million.
 


According to data provided by Twitter, since Wardle released the game in November 2021, there have been 1.7 million tweets mentioning ""Wordle"" globally. But a Twitter thread from New Zealand in late November really kicked it off.“Have you been playing Wordle? Like Mastermind (the board game) but for 5-letter words,"" Kiwi web developer David Ritchie tweeted Nov. 24. “I nailed today's in 3 attempts.”
 


Andrew Chen, 29, a research fellow at the University of Auckland who helped the government with its COVID-19 contact-tracing app, saw Ritchie’s tweet. “I like logic and word puzzles generally (stuff like Sudoku and escape rooms), and I really liked Mastermind once upon a time. I was hooked straight away,” he told BuzzFeed News.The premise of Wordle works as such: You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. The game is updated with a new word daily.So Chen started sharing his results under the thread and comparing them with other mutual connections. Which meant that Paul Brislen, a telecommunications executive in his 50s, took note of his Twitter colleagues talking about five-letter words on his feed. A former journalist himself and self-described “word nerd,” Brislen liked the idea of a pared-down, distraction-free game that forced you to “concentrate and use your brain.”
 


Participants followed the golden rule of never tweeting the answer. “That meant there was no feeling of exclusion or being too late to the party,” Brislen said. “I think that was quite important at the start. We were all in it together.”Wilson-Goldman said he encountered the thread still simmering in this small group of Twitter colleagues. “I think when I joined, there were maybe five or six people already playing through the thread, and I already followed about half of them,” he said.
 


More of their Kiwi digital friends began sharing results and number of tries under that same thread every day. It began to get a little chaotic with the flurry of messaging, so Kelsy Fletcher, a New Zealand public servant and longtime connection of Chen’s from school, suggested they use a hashtag instead, and #DailyWordleClub was born.“It felt more like you were indicating that you were part of the club than as a way to collate content,” Chen said.Even the square emojis came directly from the New Zealand crew. Elizabeth S., an adviser to the New Zealand government, found it would be “much easier” to describe their results using colored emoji tiles for an easy, spoiler-free way of sharing. The format caught on among the #DailyWordleClub members — and then Wardle implemented it in the site’s share option.
 


“There was some analysis done a while ago that showed the New Zealand Twitter community is more highly interconnected than in other countries,” Chen said. “I mean, we like to say that there's two degrees of separation in New Zealand.”Google searches for “Wordle” first began spiking in New Zealand around mid-December 2021. This pattern was quickly followed a few days later in Australia after Aussie journalists who follow some of the original New Zealand players saw it and began tweeting. On Dec. 23, Guardian Australia became the first publication to write about it; the outlet embedded six tweets from people playing the game, but only one appeared to belong to someone outside the blue-checked media community.After the Guardian article, searches began spiking in the United Kingdom and Canada. A New York Times reporter based in London profiled the origins of the game on Jan. 3. Since then, Google searches for the term “wordle” have skyrocketed over fifteenfold.
 


The internet has seen similar trends to this before, in which a trend grows from the media’s own personal interest, rather than via organic usage by people who don’t work in media. We saw it happen with “cheugy,” a term resurfaced ironically by TikTok user @webkinzwhore143. The term was pushed into the online zeitgeist after relentless media coverage about it. What began as a casual joke surrounding a teen-fabricated term to highlight millennials’ awkward aesthetic became a widely used word, in part due to media outlets’ immediate gravitation toward it. Advertisement  Often, it’s been journalists building the Wordle trend, as word lovers who play the game, fall in love with it, tweet about it (often from their blue-checked accounts), and then write stories about it, encouraging others to do the same.In just under a month, 228 articles have been published about Wordle. Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 13, 1.2 million tweets containing the green-and-yellow square emojis have been sent.Leading into 2022, the vast majority of tweets around Wordle were coming from New Zealand and Australia — but Twitter shared that the top three countries tweeting about Wordle in recent weeks are the US, the UK, and Canada.But there’s some indication the game is finally moving to other social networks. Last week, several TikTok accounts dedicated to Wordle were created, where users share their results and post memes.
 


And the Kiwi crew who started it all are proud of how they helped the game grow.""I didn't realize we were early adopters; it was just a bunch of people playing a game over summer. But then once the share button was introduced — hats off to Elizabeth for suggesting sharing that way — my Twitter feed is now entirely full of green squares,"" Brislen said. ""I can well understand why some people get angsty about it, as it's gone nuts. But just learn to mute keywords, OK, people?""Here are some tips, techniques, and opening word suggestions from some of Wordle’s earliest adopters:Andrew Chen: “I like to use ‘TIMES’ as a starting word because it has an ‘S’ at the end to quickly tell you if it's a plural word or not. I think there is a general consensus that starting words with lots of vowels are good for narrowing down the number of possible words. There's folks out there who have done analyses of the 2,500 words in the Wordle answer dictionary and determined what the ‘best’ starting words are. But I'd like to think that there are no bad starting words, that everyone can have fun whatever way they like.”Paul Brislen: “My average suggests I need more help than I can give. Usually takes me five guesses to get there, while my wife does them in three. Ugh. Use the ‘FORCE’ (a good five-letter word), try a different starter word each day, remember that what worked yesterday won't tomorrow, and don't forget that double letters are allowed (bloody ‘CLOCK’ ruined my streak).”Asher Wilson-Goldman: “I use ‘SPELT’ as my opening word and love it. It provides a good range of letters while keeping ‘R’ and ‘A’ spare to provide good follow-up word options. I know a lot of people advocate starting with words with three or four vowels, but I think they're wrong — it's much easier to guess vowels than consonants because there are fewer of them.”Thomas Beagle: “I like varying my starting words. One day I'm going to get that elusive first-guess winner! My advice is that you don't have to try to get the answer on every guess; sometimes it's better to ignore the letters you've already got and guess a word with five new letters.”

253,"One hostage was released early Saturday evening after being held inside Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas.","


All of the hostages who were held for hours inside Congregation Beth Israel, a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, were released and are safe, Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday evening.The announcement came more than five hours after one hostage, an unidentified man who was uninjured, was released, according to a police statement. He did not need medical attention. Advertisement     The status of the hostage taker was not immediately clear.The hourslong standoff outside the Dallas–Fort Worth area began Saturday morning and drew a massive police presence, including a SWAT team from Colleyville police, FBI negotiators, state public safety officers, and agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.At least four people were being held hostage, potentially including the rabbi, law enforcement officials told AP. Police were called at 10:41 a.m. local time. Residents in the immediate area were evacuated, and no injuries were reported.
 


A livestream of the Sabbath service played on the synagogue’s Facebook page at 10 a.m. Saturday. Jessika Harkay, a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, tweeted that before the livestream stopped, a man interrupted and could be heard shouting, “What the fuck is wrong with America?” and ""Don't fucking cry on me. I have 6 beautiful kids ... There are hostages in the synagogue who are going to die.”
 


The man reportedly demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a neuroscientist who was convicted of attempting to kill US soldiers and FBI agents and is currently serving an 86-year sentence at a nearby federal prison. According to US intelligence, she was suspected of being associated with al-Qaeda.Despite reports that the man was asking for the release of his “sister,” the Daily Beast reported that a lawyer who previously represented Siddiqui’s biological brother said he is not the person in the synagogue.The FBI office in Dallas did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment.
 


Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson tweeted that police officers were monitoring the city’s synagogues. The LAPD tweeted that it would be doing the same for LA’s synagogues.Synagogues have been the site of multiple mass shootings in recent years, including Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh in 2017, Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego in 2019, and an attack in Halle, Germany, the same year.

Police believe he was experiencing homelessness.It is so far unclear if Go was targeted because of her race. Police and the Manhattan district attorney said they were still investigating possible charges and evaluating the evidence.

A recent report from Stop AAPI Hate cited more than 10,000 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2021.
 


Older Asian people, many of them immigrants, have been targeted in unprovoked attacks, including stabbings, shootings, and beatings. In March 2020, six Asian women were killed in a series of shootings at spas in the Atlanta area.Wilcox noted that although the victim was Asian, minutes before the violent attack, Martial had approached another woman on the platform, who was not Asian, and made threatening movements toward her. She feared he would push her onto the tracks and moved away before witnessing him push and kill Go.The NYPD has ramped up its patrol of subway platforms and trains after an increase in transit crimes during the pandemic. Two officers were on the subway platform at the time of the attack. Advertisement

A violent volcanic eruption on a South Pacific island triggered a tsunami advisory and flooding in Hawaii and parts of the West Coast on Saturday morning.Satellite footage showed a massive plume of ash and smoke and atmospheric shock waves following the eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai underwater volcano near Tonga on the evening of Jan. 14. Advertisement     The boom was reportedly heard as far away as New Zealand (more than 1,200 miles away) and Anchorage, Alaska (more than 5,800 miles away). The ash plume reached up to 12 miles into the air, Tonga Geological Services reported, and dozens of coastal areas, from Japan to Chile, triggered tsunami warnings.
 


Video footage from Tonga residents showed a swift, violent ocean tide rushing inland. One person told a New Zealand outlet that she felt the ground shake, saw water flood her home, and watched as the walls of a neighbor’s home collapsed. Resident Faka’iloatonga Taumoefolau tweeted, “Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.” Advertisement     
 


Nukuʻalofa, the capital of Tonga, is less than 50 miles south of the eruption, and many parts of the South Pacific island are reportedly experiencing a near-total power outage.The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami advisory for the West Coast states, Alaska, and Hawaii, meaning a ""potential for strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water."" Waves 1 to 3 feet high were expected along the Oregon and Washington coasts.Maui and Kaua’i saw waves of 2.7 feet high, just under the criterion for a tsunami warning (3 feet). Hawaii's tsunami advisory was canceled just before 8 a.m. local time. National Weather Service reports advised people to stay away from beaches, harbors, and marinas, but said that widespread inundation was not expected.Japan's system issued warnings for Iwate prefecture to the north of its main Honshu island and for the Amami and Tokara islands to the south. Most of its east coast was placed under a tsunami advisory.Video in Santa Cruz, California, showed minor flooding along the coast. Cal Fire shared video of large waves hitting El Granada, California, on Saturday morning.
 


Most tsunamis are caused by large earthquakes, but they can also be triggered by landslides or volcanic eruptions. Although the eruption in Tonga was one of the most violent seen by orbiting weather satellites, the amount of water displaced would still be much less than can be caused by a major earthquake. Still, even relatively small surges in sea level can cause damage when water surges into bays and inlets.

257,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative. Advertisement     But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus.But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly. Advertisement     Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk. Advertisement     Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.”For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it. Advertisement  Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Center. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said.Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race. Advertisement  Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results.Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said. Advertisement  Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time.Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ● Advertisement

Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

Actor and comedian Tiffany Haddish was arrested early Friday in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence, police said.Peachtree City police said in a statement that they received a call around 2:30 a.m. about a driver asleep at the wheel on Highway 74. While en route, an officer conducted a traffic stop after spotting a vehicle matching the description that had ""pulled into the yard of a residence."" Haddish was taken into custody without incident. Advertisement     
 


According to the Associated Press, the actor posted a $1,666 bond and was released from Fayette County Jail the same day.Representatives for Haddish did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that published Friday, she said her life was ""in shambles"" in reference to the recent deaths of her grandmother, her dog, music producer Carl Craig, and actor Bob Saget.""I'm very emotional. I've been crying a lot 'cause it's— That's my heart,"" she said. ""My dog was my heart, and the other people who passed, you know, they were my rocks. They had my back. I mean, they taught me a lot, so I lost the physical; I'm sure I got them in the spiritual.""Haddish, who got her start as a stand-up comedian, broke out with a role in NBC's The Carmichael Show. She then appeared in Girls Trip and has had a starring role in TBS's The Last O.G.

Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections. Advertisement     “I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said. Advertisement     Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down. Advertisement     “Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live. Advertisement     The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.”Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing. Advertisement     When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

The Biden administration announced Friday that it will double its supply of coronavirus rapid tests to a total of 1 billion and make those tests freely available online for every American household.Beginning Jan. 19, Americans can visit COVIDtests.gov to order up to four rapid tests per household (officials could not specify exactly when on that day the site will go live). Advertisement     The move comes as the US struggles with soaring COVID-19 cases caused chiefly by the Omicron variant, which has smashed case count and hospitalization records nationwide.Tests will be free. The only information required for purchase is a name and mailing address. But officials estimated that the tests would not ship until 7–12 days after purchase, meaning the soonest they could arrive in homes is Jan. 26.In early December, the Biden administration unveiled a winter strategy for the Omicron variant, focusing on more people getting boosters, more vaccinations for school-age kids, as well as requirements for private insurers to pay for at-home tests. Later in the month, Biden announced plans to open 20,000 free testing sites and to send federal medical teams to assist overloaded hospitals, which are now being deployed.But the requirement for private insurers to cover at-home tests does not go into effect until Jan. 15, meaning it has not helped pay for rapid tests during the holiday Omicron surge. The administration also came under fire as at-home test supplies ran short on pharmacy shelves over the holidays as Omicron cases skyrocketed. This led to the first plans to make 500 million free tests available to Americans, followed by Friday’s doubling of that figure. Advertisement     Nam Tran, a professor of clinical pathology at the University of California, Davis, said he welcomed Friday’s announcement and noted that any expansion of testing is good news, but he cautioned that people need to remember how to test appropriately. “We shouldn't be just testing out of overall anxiety concern, we should be testing for good reasons,” he said.According to the CDC, rapid tests should be used if you have COVID symptoms, if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has COVID, or if you will be gathering indoors with someone who is either at high risk for severe disease or is unvaccinated.But if you’re asymptomatic, Tran said, it’s critical to test more than once, at least 36 hours apart. “Testing multiple times, over time, allows you to catch the virus when it reaches that level that becomes detectable,” he said. This means the four tests per household would only be enough to get a meaningful result for two asymptomatic people. In symptomatic individuals, Tran said, the viral load is likely high enough that one test should be sufficient to tell if that person is infectious.

A plus-size woman who went viral after posing in a lime green athleisure outfit told BuzzFeed News that she hopes that one day we can get to a place where fat people buying clothes isn’t considered revolutionary.While plus-size mannequins have generally been embraced by brands and celebrated by activists as a step in the right direction for body acceptance, the sight of one didn’t seem to have the same impact on one conservative British TV host. Advertisement     “This, in a Regent St fitness store, is what obesity looks like. Flabby curves highlighted in hideous lime green velour,” tweeted Isabel Oakeshott, a GB News presenter who describes herself as a “professional feather ruffler.”The commentator criticized the window display at a London branch for Fabletics, which featured a plus-size mannequin dressed in a velour three-piece set, and called the body positivity movement “dangerous.”In response, Sophia Tassew, a content creator and business owner from London, served up the best reply when she shared a photo of herself looking fantastic in the “dangerous” outfit, which she went out to purchase for herself.
 


“That was my statement in itself,” Tassew told BuzzFeed News.“It's like, you guys are gonna have to get used to us. Thanks for sharing the fit. Now I'm going to cop it, and life goes on,” she said.The 24-year-old, who designs and owns a jewelry brand, wants it to be known that she “genuinely just liked the outfit.” She didn’t intend her response to be a major clapback, but Tassew said she recognizes that simply existing as a fat woman is seen by some as a statement.“Me, just being a plus-size person, I want a new outfit, and it's caused all this commotion, and it really shouldn't actually be that way, but it is,” Tassew said. “It's still seen as something that's a big deal, revolutionary, when we just want a new pair of leggings.”The reaction to her post has largely been positive, she said, noting that the store manager of that specific location told her that the mannequin in question has often prompted an emotional response from customers.“She gets people coming into her store crying because of the mannequin, and I was like, wow. So as long as it's done more good than anything, then I'm completely fine. I'm happy,” Tassew said.
 


Her post, which has more than 400K likes and over 30K retweets, prompted other women to share photos of themselves in the outfit.Tassew said that she no longer identified with the body positivity movement, calling them buzzwords and a movement that had been co-opted. Now, she champions the right to a quality of life.“I think my thing now is about fat liberation and just trying to understand how fat people can move around the world freely because obviously the world is not designed for us,” she said.The business owner has previously worked with the likes of fashion retailer Asos as a style insider and influencer, routinely modeling and creating content highlighting the best pieces for plus-size consumers.Since Tassew went viral, representatives for Fabletics have reached out to her. Fabletics, an athleisure brand cofounded by actor Kate Hudson, is routinely championed for having an inclusive offering, with sizes ranging from 0 to 24.Tassew is hopeful that her influence can be channeled into representing what it means to be fat in a world where anti-fat behavior persists.“It's so much deeper than just taking selfies to show your rolls,” Tassew said. “We're affected in so many ways that people don't actually realize, whether that be medically, financially, or socially.” Advertisement

Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally signed off on a secret advertising deal that allegedly gave Facebook special privileges on Google’s ad platform, according to newly unredacted court documents filed on Friday.The allegation is from a complaint first filed in December 2020 by Texas and several other states against Google for engaging in ""false, deceptive, or misleading acts"" while operating its buy-and-sell auction system for digital ads. In the complaint, state attorneys general claim Google illegally teamed up with Facebook, its fiercest competitor in the digital advertising market, for a 2018 deal Google dubbed “Jedi Blue” in a reference to Star Wars. Advertisement     Prior to the alleged deal, Facebook appeared to threaten Google's dominance in the market by backing an ad-buying technique called ""header bidding.""""Google understood the severity of the threat to its position if Facebook were to enter the market and support header bidding,"" the complaint reads. ""To diffuse this threat, Google made overtures to Facebook."" In the end, Facebook backed off after Google agreed to give the social network ""information, speed, and other advantages"" in auctions run by Google, the complaint says.The newly unredacted version of the complaint shows that the deal was allegedly struck at the highest levels of the companies, a noteworthy level of cooperation from two of the most powerful companies in the world.“Google CEO Sundar Pichai also personally signed off on the terms of the deal,” the unredacted complaint reads.The complaint also says the team working on the deal directly addressed Zuckerberg in an email, saying the company was “nearly ready to sign” and needed “approval” to move forward. Zuckerberg wanted to meet with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg before making a decision. The executives’ names are redacted from the complaint, but their titles are visible. Advertisement     The revelation comes as both Google and Facebook face a crackdown from state and federal officials over antitrust concerns for their business practices. Earlier this week, a judge rejected Facebook's motion to dismiss a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission that accuses the social network of using anticompetitive tactics.Google on Friday said the lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, isn’t “accurate.”“We sign hundreds of agreements every year that don't require CEO approval, and this was no different,” Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels said in a statement. “And contrary to AG Paxton’s claims, the fact of this agreement was never a secret — it was well-publicized. It simply enables FAN [Facebook Audience Network] and the advertisers it represents to participate in Open Bidding, just like over 25 other partners do.”Meta, Facebook’s parent company, echoed Google’s assertion that the deal didn’t single out Facebook.“Meta’s non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements,” Meta spokesperson Stephen Peters said in a statement. “These business relationships enable Meta to deliver more value to advertisers while fairly compensating publishers, resulting in better outcomes for all.”Google says it plans to ask a judge to dismiss the case.

266,IT’S THE HUMIDITY!,"Nearly a year since their split, and it looks like both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are making the most of single life. As you may have heard, Kanye (now legally known as Ye) recently made his triumphant return to the dating circuit, going public with actor Julia Fox. After speculation about the nature of their relationship began swirling last month, Julia confirmed their romance last week, revealing in a blog post for Interview magazine that Ye had gifted her an entire hotel suite full of clothes on their second date. Since then, Ye and Julia have been practically inseparable, stepping out for numerous date nights and flaunting their newfound affection for one another at every possible occasion. And so, while her ex is pulling out all the stops for his new beau, it seems like Kim Kardashian is adopting a more casual approach to her love life. Off the back of Ye and Julia's well-documented debut, some Kardashian fans were left a little confused on Wednesday when Kim and her rumored boyfriend, Pete Davidson, were photographed enjoying an uncharacteristically low-key date night. On Tuesday evening, Pete and Kim — who were first romantically linked in October — ditched the typical celeb hot spots that LA has to offer, and opted for a chill dinner at a budget-friendly pizza chain. In stark contrast to Ye and Julia's recent date nights, Kim and Pete were photographed cozying up in a wooden booth as they shared pizza and sipped Diet Cokes. In keeping with the laid-back vibe, Kim swapped her usual Balenciaga statement looks for a dark sweater and leggings, blending in seamlessly with the other diners, who apparently barely noticed she was there. And for dessert, the casual duo relocated to a local Rite Aid drugstore where they grabbed some ice cream and engaged in a spot of PDA, before walking hand in hand back to their car — a refreshingly normal activity for two of the world’s most-talked-about people. To make matters more surprising, Tuesday night’s rendezvous wasn’t Kim and Pete’s only unusual outing this week. Just a day prior on Monday, an unsuspecting shopper snapped footage of the duo strolling around an outlet mall in Camarillo, California. The images were shared on social media and quickly published by Page Six, prompting a lot of confusion from fans. It still remains unclear what might attract a billionaire like Kim to an outlet mall, but nonetheless, it was reported that the couple paid a visit to a candy store where they picked up caramel apples and frozen bananas — a far cry from Kim's beloved Nobu. In years gone by, if you spotted Kim K browsing an outlet mall or nipping to a drugstore for a late-night ice cream run, you'd be forgiven for thinking that she might be lost. But — if her unlikely pairing with Pete was any indication — the past few months have shown that Kim is embarking on a totally new phase. And besides, as plenty of fans have pointed out, her revised outlook on life shouldn't come as a surprise. Fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians might remember that Kim spoke incredibly candidly about the breakdown of her relationship with Ye in the show’s finale episode, which aired in June last year. During a sit-down conversation with Kris Jenner — which was reportedly filmed about a month before she filed for divorce in Feb 2021 — Kim reflected on what she learned from her marriage and her hopes for moving forward. So, reflecting on life in her 40s, Kim hinted that her professional success had been tainted by the struggles in her marriage, explaining that she had no one to share her life with. “I feel like I’ve worked so hard in life to achieve everything that I’ve wanted to, and I’ve lived up to my expectations and achieved 10 times more than I even thought was humanly possible,” she began. “But I don’t have a life to share that with.” “But turning 40 this year, I was like, No, I don’t want a husband that lives in a completely different state,” she said, referring to the fact that the latter months of their marriage were split between her home in LA and Ye's preferred base in Wyoming. “I used to think that [living apart] was when we were getting along the best, but to me that’s sad and that’s not what I want,” she said. At this stage in the conversation, Kim went on to talk candidly about what she wanted from a future partner, emphasizing that common interests were important to her. “I want someone where we have the same [TV] shows in common. I want someone that wants to work out with me,” she said. “Every single day, Khloé, Tristan, and I would work out at 6 a.m., and I was third-wheeling it for a good eight months in quarantine, and I was so envious of that.” If you’ve been following Kimye for a while, you’ll know that grand gestures were a huge part of their relationship. From renting out an entire baseball stadium to hosting private concerts in their home, it’s no secret that Ye spared no expense when it came to his wife. In fact, even as recently as October 2020 — just three months before news of their split surfaced — Ye marked Kim’s 40th birthday by surprising her with an eerily realistic hologram of her father, Robert Kardashian, who died in 2003. Shortly after this, it was reported that Kanye splashed out over $1 million on five Mercedes-Maybachs that he gifted Kim for Christmas, just a matter of weeks before their divorce went public. However, as she reflected on their years of marriage in the KUWTK finale, Kim realized that she had grown tired of Ye’s extravagance, and instead was yearning for the “smaller” and more meaningful experiences. “It’s the little things that I don’t have,” Kim said at the time. “I have all the big things. I have [everything] extravagant you could possibly imagine. And no one will ever do it like that [again]. I’m grateful for those experiences, but I think I’m ready for the smaller experiences that I think will mean a lot.” Which brings us to now, and Kim's new approach to romance hasn't gone unnoticed by fans. After she and Pete were spotted on their pizza date this week, fans were quick to highlight how the uncharacteristically low-key outing made them think of Kim's comments about the extravagance of her marriage to Kanye. “This reminds me of when Kim said little things are more important for her,” one person wrote on Instagram beneath a photograph of Kim and Pete sharing pizza. In agreement, another fan reflected on Kim’s sentiments about Kanye, theorizing that his grand gestures had perhaps been more performative than meaningful. ""The thing is that those big things are for the world to see but the little things is what your heart sees and appreciates the most,"" someone else wrote. What's more, another huge talking point of Kim and Kanye's split has been its impact on Kim's style and overall image. In light of her new approach to dating, some fans suggested that her seemingly more laid-back attitude appears to have manifested in her style, noting that her looks have been more ""relaxed"" and ""casual"" recently. On the whole, it seems like fans are definitely happy to see Kim finally getting to embrace the ""little things"" in her love life, praising her ""newly found happiness"" after a turbulent year. Of course, this doesn’t mean that Kim is completely giving up her lavish lifestyle — she and Pete took a trip to the Bahamas just a few weeks ago. But, as one fan pointed out, it's great to see Kim finding a happy balance. And even though they've yet to officially confirm their romance, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that things are going pretty well between this unlikely pair. ""He makes her laugh, plays around and has a sense of humor,"" a source told Entertainment Tonight this week. ""It is nice for Kim to be around that. Pete knows how to talk to Kim. He is the most confident guy, but not cocky. It is why it works with them."" So, while Kim and Pete's coupling may have initially come as a surprise, it was perhaps on the horizon all along."
267,"Kim appears to be swapping extravagance for ease, and this is why it makes total sense.","


Teisha Hawley couldn’t believe her luck.The mother of three from South Jordan, Utah, had just won what she felt was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. She and her husband, Jeff, had been selected to have several rooms in their home renovated in October 2019 by an Instagram-famous couple, Candis and Andy Meredith, for a new television show. The Merediths, a couple from Utah with a blended family of seven children, had made a name for themselves in the DIY space with a 2015 HGTV show called Old Home Love, a 2017 book of the same name, and their project to convert a 20,000-square-foot 1907 schoolhouse into their family home.Candis told Hawley that the show, eventually called Home Work, would air on Magnolia Network, the soon-to-be-launched television network from Fixer Upper DIY superstars Chip and Joanna Gaines. According to Hawley, Candis told her that Joanna had personally looked at photos and said she liked the Hawleys’ house, which made Hawley feel like she was living “literally every person's dream.” Advertisement  For the Hawleys, the invocation of the Gaines name was everything. After Fixer Upper premiered on HGTV in 2013 and became the No. 1 unscripted series on all of cable television, the Gaineses have become the king and queen of home decor and renovation, with a line at Target and a series of stores and tourist attractions in their hometown of Waco, Texas. Earlier this month they officially launched their Magnolia Network as a joint venture with Discovery, with the aim of reclaiming “the best of what television can be.” Ahead of the launch, the network had premiered several shows from the network on Discovery Plus, including Home Work, which debuted with 13 episodes in July.
 


But to the Hawleys and three other homeowners who were selected in 2019 to be featured on Home Work, the network's launch was a different kind of milestone in what has become a multiyear fight.According to the Hawleys, their dream of a Magnolia-approved home renovation soon turned into a nightmare that left their kitchen, laundry room, and living room unusable, and the family down $35,000. Another homeowner, Aubry Bennion, has accused the Merediths of taking the $13,000 she paid them for a kitchen renovation and then leaving her project incomplete for months. When the renovation was completed, she claims the Merediths did a subpar job. Another pair of homeowners, Vienna and Rob Goates, said they paid the Merediths $50,000 for an addition to their home, but said the couple never completed any work. After this happened, the Goateses negotiated with the Merediths for a return of the money they paid, but have only been compensated for about a third of the deposit to date.On Wednesday, the Merediths posted a series of rebuttals to the claims of the three homeowners on their joint Instagram account. The Merediths denied many of the allegations against them, calling the “one-sided narrative” a series of “half truths and outright lies.” They said that while they understand home renovations can be difficult, they claim they did everything in their power to make their clients happy.“We have not heard from these clients in almost two years, and to have this come out publicly on the eve of the Magnolia network launch feels calculated and timed to hurt us the most. We have always been available for a resolution,” they said in part, adding, “We acknowledge that there were misunderstandings and hard conversations along the way, but just like with our many other happy clients, we did everything we could to resolve any issues that arose.”In a phone call with BuzzFeed News, Candis said the couple are “very proud of the work that we’ve done.”“We've never stolen anything and we’re not out to take anybody else’s livelihood away the same way ours has kind of been taken here,” she said. “And we’re very proud of the show.”Multiple requests for comment to the Gaineses went unanswered.The homeowners, some of whom connected via mutual acquaintances in Utah and began sharing notes, said they had fought to get the Merediths, Discovery, and Magnolia to answer their allegations, but had gotten nowhere. Finally, Bennion decided to go public in a social media Hail Mary. She posted her account of the renovation on her Instagram page on Jan. 5, and the other women soon followed as an act of solidarity.Bennion’s account went viral, and Discovery and Magnolia Network quickly announced that they would be pulling Home Work from the streamer.“Magnolia Network is aware that certain homeowners have expressed concerns about renovation projects undertaken by Candis and Andy Meredith,” Allison Page, the president of Magnolia Network, told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Within the last several days, we have learned additional information about the scope of these issues, and we have decided to remove Home Work from the Magnolia Network line up pending a review of the claims that have been made.”However, late Thursday night, Magnolia Network announced that Home Work will be returning to the network. “After speaking with homeowners as well as Candis and Andy Meredith regarding renovation projects for Home Work, and hearing a mix of both positive and negative experiences, we do not believe there was ill or malicious intent,” Page told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “Our commitment now is to provide appropriate resolutions for those whose experience with Home Work fell short of our network’s standards.” An attorney for the Hawleys and Bennion told BuzzFeed News they are ""encouraged,"" by Discovery's apparent desire ""to do the right thing and correct the situation,"" while the Goatses told BuzzFeed News they ""are relieved to see that Magnolia has stepped in and committed to take action.""At the time of publication, a spokesperson for Discovery did not respond to further inquiries about the allegations made by the three homeowners. Discovery also did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about which production company was behind Home Work and who was responsible for its operations. An IMDb page for Home Work lists the Merediths and one other person as executive producers (this individual did not return a request for comment). Candis told BuzzFeed News the show was coproduced by her and her husband’s production company and one other company, but declined to name either. It’s also difficult to verify what the actual Home Work show looked like, as all episodes have been pulled from the streaming platform.For Bennion, the Hawleys, and the Goateses, the online response to their story has been bittersweet. They are pleased to finally be heard, but they want to know why they had to go so public to have anyone involved pay attention. “For Magnolia’s reputation to be on the line and for them to be so seasoned in doing what they do at Discovery, why would they allow these amateurs to do this and never check on them?” Bennion told BuzzFeed News. (Discovery did not respond to a request for comment on this allegation.)The Goateses, who appeared in a trailer for Home Work despite the fact that their project had not even started, said they want some accountability from Discovery and Magnolia.“I don’t think that the Merediths would have gotten as far as they did without the credibility of the Gaineses and Magnolia and their brand,” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News.
 


For Bennion, the experience with the Merediths has been doubly disappointing because she had previously had such a good relationship with the Magnolia brand.Bennion works in project management full time but runs a small business, Hello Maypole, which sells felt balls and garlands, on the side. She has sold her products at Magnolia vendor fairs and even wholesale at Magnolia stores, she said. She also had a friendly relationship with the Merediths through her business’s Instagram page.So when she heard from a mutual friend that the Merediths were partnering with Magnolia, and then saw the couple put a casting call for a yet-to-be-announced show on their Instagram, where they have more than 100,000 followers, she was intrigued. After making and submitting a video for consideration, Bennion got the news she had been selected to have her kitchen renovated.The Hawleys and the Goateses told BuzzFeed News they responded to the same casting call on social media. Hawley had followed the Merediths on Instagram for a while, and was thrilled to be chosen for the show. They said with Candis’s claim that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their home, they felt especially “solid” about signing up. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever telling the Hawleys that the Gaineses saw their house and said the Gaineses had nothing to do with the selection process.)“Hearing Magnolia and then Chip and Jo's name being dropped as much as it was, I felt like that really built a trust in everything,” Jeff Hawley told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement  “I remember just thinking like, wow, this is a big deal,” Vienna Goates said. “It was hard for us to comprehend it at that point. But we just knew it was going to be great.”
 


The Hawleys agreed to renovate their kitchen, dining room, family room, and laundry room — essentially an entire floor — for the show. The Merediths told them the renovation would cost $45,000, which seemed low to the Hawleys, but they said they figured the Merediths knew best.(Homeowners on television renovation shows pay for their own renovations most of the time, according to HGTV. The network states that the draw of being on their shows is primarily getting to work with their designers, not getting things for free.)The couple filmed introductions at their home with a film crew and the Merediths, and the demolition started on Oct. 30, 2019. Hawley was a little concerned that the demolition had started before they had sent any money or signed a contract, but she said Candis told her things moved fast in television and they would figure it all out.Besides, she thought, this was Magnolia.“Magnolia’s here, they’re demoing without [us paying] any money,” Hawley said she thought. “Of course this is legit, you know?”After contractors demolished their first floor, the Hawleys and their three children moved into the basement without a kitchen or laundry. They said that the Merediths told them it would take no longer than three or four weeks, so they figured they could make it work for a short period of time. In November they received a contract from the Merediths and a request for $35,000, the balance owed for the renovation (the remaining $10,000 would cover furniture costs).According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they needed to wire the money as soon as possible. This was stressful because the couple had planned to pay for the renovation with a home equity loan, but now didn’t have time to arrange it.“So this wasn’t something we were able to finance,” Teisha Hawley said, adding that they drew the balance directly from their savings account.The Hawleys said after that, things stalled. At first, they chalked it up to the holidays. Then, more time passed.“We would repeatedly be told contractors would be there a certain day to only then be told there were delays or someone had quit and that we needed to be patient,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “Sadly our 3-4 week project was well into the 8-10 week range, we would have weeks go by without anyone coming or hearing a thing.” In the meantime, the family spent the holidays in their basement.“Living in the basement in Utah, when the weather is crappy and it’s snowy and dark, it takes a toll on you,” Hawley said.Across town, Bennion’s project for Home Work, which began the same month as the Hawleys, was also not proceeding as she had hoped. She had filmed the initial introduction with the Merediths for the show and said she had agreed to a $25,000 kitchen renovation that the Merediths said would take three weeks. Bennion wrote on Instagram that faced with the same timing issues and inability to get a home equity loan as the Hawleys, she had to borrow the funds from her parents.After demolition started on her kitchen, Bennion said the work also faced delays. She said she tried to put her faith in her prior relationship with the Merediths and the belief that things progressed differently on television, but she began to grow concerned as the project got more delayed. The morning of Thanksgiving 2019, the Merediths requested Bennion wire the funds. She sent them half, $13,000, the following Monday morning.
 


In mid-November, with no movement on the project, Bennion began pressing Candis for answers. After Candis showed her a vision board for the design for her home, she said she began to relax.“Seeing the design elements and the promise of a kitchen by Christmas was enough to keep the worries at bay and the momentum chugging, despite what was actually happening — or not — in my home,” she wrote on Instagram.However, Bennion said on Instagram, things continued to stall. As January turned into February, Bennion said she began to have “absolutely zero faith that any of it was real.”“I was certain I was being fed a line, the same line I had been for the three and a half months before with missing crews and poor work performed one or two days at a time, totaling less than two weeks of actual work days in my home,” she wrote.The Hawleys had also reached a crisis point. In early January, they met with the Merediths to discuss their project. According to the Hawleys, the Merediths told them they had already spent their entire budget and would now require another $35,000 to $40,000 to complete the work. The Merediths requested another $10,000 immediately via wire transfer in order to continue working on the project. The Hawleys were stunned.“Hopeless is the word that comes to mind when I think of that day,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram. “I had applied for this show and had put our family in this situation.” Advertisement  The couple decided they were done. In February, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, they told the Merediths they wanted to walk away. They said they had never signed their contract or any release allowing Magnolia Network to use their footage. They hired a contractor friend to get the rooms back into a “livable condition,” and have been slowly working on the project since. Two years later, the Hawleys said the experience with the Merediths has taken a toll.“The lack of communication, the lack of respect for our budget and the lack of respect for realizing my family was living in a basement truly makes me sick,” Teisha Hawley wrote on Instagram.
 


In response to the Hawleys’ claims, the Merediths said that the budget increases were due to requests from the Hawleys, saying the “scope changed mutually.” “There was a list of ‘must haves’ that kept growing, and it was clear we needed to sit down to discuss anything they were hoping to increase,” the Merediths wrote. They denied having any knowledge the Hawleys were unhappy until they received a demand letter from the couple’s attorney, but Candis declined to elaborate to BuzzFeed News what it said.“We tried to reach out and offer any and all assistance, we were ignored. We had spent about $10,000 of our own money at this point. We offered solutions. We haven’t heard from them whatsoever in almost two years,” they wrote. The Hawleys, in a statement, told BuzzFeed News they had no ulterior motive for coming forward. “This isn’t just about project delays and a poor renovation experience. There are patterns of manipulation, dishonesty, and gross negligence here,” they said. Advertisement  The Goates family also filmed an introduction for the show in October 2019, during which Candis told them their addition, which would add a much-needed second bathroom for their family of seven, would be featured in the grand finale episode of Home Work. The Goateses were thrilled by Candis’s appreciation for their beloved cottage.“She said, ‘This is the biggest project’ and … ‘I’ve always wanted to do a house like yours,’” Vienna Goates told BuzzFeed News. The couple felt that their project was important to the Merediths and the network, and, when Candis told them a few months later that Joanna Gaines had personally expressed interest in their project, they even felt like the Gaineses were invested. (In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Candis denied ever saying this.)These sentiments helped them look past a series of what they now call red flags with the project. Their renovation, the Goateses said, was beset with delays from the start. They had originally been told the project could possibly be wrapped by Christmas 2019, which came and went. It wasn’t until Jan. 29, 2020, Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, that Candis finally told them “she’d met with all her contractors and was confident the project could go forward as planned.” The Goateses signed a contract and in February 2020 sent the Merediths a wire transfer for $50,000, half of the project’s total cost, as a deposit. They drew the funds from a home equity loan they had previously arranged.
 


According to the Goateses, still nothing happened. The couple said they frequently reached out for updates, but said Candis told them that COVID-19 was causing project delays. Finally, they heard a concrete update from Candis when, on April 29, 2020, she shared a trailer for Home Work with them. The Goateses said they were stunned to see themselves featured, as they had assumed they wouldn’t be making the cut because of the project delays.“We felt this was an effort to placate our anxiety,” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News. “Because at this point, I was like, have we been robbed? Is this some sort of con?” But seeing themselves in the preview made them feel more confident that their renovation would start soon.“That solidified at that point Chip and Joanna know what we're going through, and they’re excited about us because there we are on their channel,” Vienna Goates said.The couple’s relief was short-lived. In May, Rob Goates was laid off from his job, and no work had begun. The couple began to question if they should pull out of the project for financial reasons, but they said Candis convinced them to stay the course.“[Candis] was very kind and she said she’d spoken to production and they agreed they would make our HELOC [home equity line of credit] payments for us and help us financially so we could go forward with the project,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “Candis said that Joanna Gaines specifically had interest in our project, and that they all really wanted our renovation to continue to be on the show.”But by September 2020, with the renovation still not underway and money tight, the Goateses decided to quit.“You may think it was naive and foolish of us to let things go on even this long,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram. “You would be right. But a global pandemic makes a convenient excuse for many things, and honestly we were in absolute survival mode. Plus, we had faith in the reputation of Chip and Joanna and their beloved Magnolia brand and Candis’s repeated assurances that everything would work out.”Since then, the Goateses said, they have been fighting to get back the deposit they sent the Merediths. They hired a lawyer and Candis agreed to a judgment that stated the couple could sue if she did not refund the money. According to the Goateses, so far they have been refunded about $14,000 by the Merediths. Rob Goates estimates they have spent upward of $60,000 total on the debacle, including lawyer’s fees. They aren’t sure they will ever get their full deposit back.“There’s nothing quite like paying a bill on a huge balance that is literally for NOTHING,” Vienna Goates wrote on Instagram, referring to their home equity loan.In their rebuttal, the Merediths claimed that after the Goateses asked for their deposit back, the unnamed contractor, whom they had paid the $50,000 to, told them he could not refund the money. So, they said, they agreed to refund the Goates family personally, confirming they had thus far paid them $14,000. “We care deeply about the Goates and we are taking this responsibility seriously,” they wrote.In response to the Merediths' public posting, the Goateses told BuzzFeed News, “We appreciate that they recognized the validity of our situation … however, there has been a lack of regular communication and transparency.“We tried every avenue possible to resolve this privately, our story and our paper trail speaks to that, and speaking out publicly was an extremely unfortunate last resort,” they said.Through word of mouth and mutual acquaintances, the Hawleys eventually connected with Bennion and began to share notes. Bennion’s renovation had also ended poorly, she told BuzzFeed News. In February, she had met with Candis, telling her she planned to quit the show and the project if it didn’t improve.During the meeting, Bennion wrote on Instagram, Candis told her that her project was now also costing way more than expected: $40,000. According to Bennion, Candis also said she had already spent the money. In their rebuttal, the Merediths claim they paid $32,000 of their own funds toward completing the project.“We’ve been using our own money and we can’t really afford to feed our kids,” Bennion said Candis told her. In response, Candis told BuzzFeed News that the remark was “taken out of context,” but fronting the costs of Bennion’s renovation did “put us into tricky situations with our family.”Although she was furious, Bennion believed she had leverage. “From my perspective, she needed my project to be complete more than I needed her to complete it for me,” Bennion wrote on Instagram, adding she believed this because she knew that couples had dropped out of the show. “As such, she was willing to push the financial conversation down the road a bit more, even after I told her she was working at risk.”The Merediths’ contractors eventually finished the kitchen and Bennion filmed a reveal for the show, but she said she never signed a contract or an appearance release for Magnolia. According to Bennion, the finished product has been rife with problems and shoddy work.“I’ll never show the finished product on the internet because it cleans up nice and, with the right filter, is worthy of every wow and word of praise for everyone who doesn’t have to live in it or had to live through what it took to get there,” she wrote on Instagram.The Merediths fiercely denied Bennion’s allegations on Instagram, saying, “[Bennion’s Instagram handle] has made false claims and is purposely trying to take anything she can from us.” They claimed the renovation of her kitchen was done well and posted several videos that they claimed showed Bennion happy with the end result.“We are very proud of the work that went into this project,” they wrote. “We revealed this space on February 20, 2020 and fully acknowledge that before this point in time there were hard conversations and misunderstandings about this project and budget, but we were absolutely under the impression that we had resolved those issues together. If Aubry was unhappy at this point overall, we had no idea whatsoever.”Candis told BuzzFeed News that the majority of Bennion’s complaints about the project’s delays were out of her control as the delays were because of the contractors and workers. She said she and Andy decided not to attempt to recoup the $32,000 they spent of their own money on Bennion’s project because they “didn't want that kitchen to feel anything but positive for her overall.”“I just wanted her to feel at peace. And if that meant that I had spent that money, that was OK,” she said. Bennion told BuzzFeed News that while she did feign excitement during parts of the project, “It is easy to be selective in memory. The truth is that there are many text messages, which I still have record of, that show I was very dissatisfied regularly throughout the project.”
 


Since the homeowners began to share notes in spring 2020, they said they have been working to figure out some sort of restitution. Both the Hawleys and Bennion said they consulted attorneys, who told them even if they had a judgment against the Merediths, it’s unlikely they would ever see a dime. In addition to consulting attorneys, they also in 2021 filed complaints against the couple with the Utah Department of Commerce’s Consumer Protection Division.“We did everything in our power to contact everybody we could to make sure that this was taken care of and nothing was ever addressed or taken care of or anything,” Teisha Hawley said.
 


For a long time, the Goateses said they told themselves that Magnolia, Discovery, and the Gaineses couldn’t possibly know what had happened. If they knew, they thought, they would do something to fix it. In August 2021, they decided to attempt to contact the network and Magnolia, emailing a customer service line. They got a response from an attorney for Discovery, who told them in an email, reviewed by BuzzFeed News, that the network would encourage the couple to address their concerns directly with the Merediths.“We do not believe it would be helpful for Discovery to try and mediate this matter, especially since counsel is already involved and you have already sought legal recourse,” the attorney wrote in part. The attorney added that the network understood that the Merediths would “like to resolve the outstanding balance that is owed.”“At that point, we just hung our heads and cried because we were like, what more can we do?” Rob Goates told BuzzFeed News.All the homeowners said they have been validated by the response on social media to their stories, although going so public has taken a toll. Since Bennion and the others’ accounts went viral, a Utah real estate agent, Aaron Oldham, posted an hourlong IGTV video describing what he said was his own poor experience working with the Merediths on a renovation in 2013. Commenters on Oldham’s video also began to do their own sleuthing on the couple, highlighting a 2020 lawsuit against them for appearing as celebrity endorsers for the real estate seminar company Zurixx.While Bennion said she has appreciated the support, she was disappointed about how difficult it was to get Magnolia Network to respond to her claims. Since she had never interacted with anyone from the network directly, she said, she initially had no contact to seek restitution from.Finally, through her contacts on the purchasing side of the Magnolia company, she said she was connected with Magnolia’s attorney and asked them if she could break an NDA she signed as part of her wholesale agreement to share her story. Bennion shared her experience with the Magnolia team, who, she said, blamed the issue on the show’s production company. The Hawleys said they also contacted Magnolia through their attorney, but said they were told the network said it was not its responsibility.Bennion said she has found the experience hard to reconcile with the version of the Magnolia brand she had loved.“Magnolia shouldn’t be surprised because we gave them a fair shake to do their part,” she said.But when the show rolled around, they began to question how much they had been “taken advantage of.”“As the show launched and we saw how happy and successful and fun it was and we were just left out in the cold, that was really violating,” Rob Goates said.Hawley said she just wants someone to be accountable for what happened to her.“What I have posted, it’s not to trash Magnolia,” Hawley told BuzzFeed News. “I just want them to be better. Their name, people across the entire country trust it. And so the fact that this has happened under their brand is just devastating to me.” ●

KYIV — After Russia massed some 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border in recent weeks, the Biden administration said it believes Moscow is preparing to again invade its Eastern European neighbor.“The United States is concerned that the Russian government is preparing for an invasion into Ukraine that may result in widespread human rights violations and war crimes should diplomacy fail to meet their objectives,” a US official told BuzzFeed News on Friday. Advertisement     “As part of its plans, Russia is laying the groundwork to have the option of fabricating a pretext for invasion, including through sabotage activities and information operations, by accusing Ukraine of preparing an imminent attack against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.”The statement, on the heels of unsuccessful high-stakes negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, was Washington’s strongest and most ominous yet on the latest Russian aggression targeting Ukraine.It also echoes a report published earlier Friday by Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense. That report warned that Russian special services are preparing a provocation against Russian soldiers and targeting an arms depot in the Transnistrian region of Moldova where Putin has peacekeepers. The goal, the intelligence agency said, was also to create an excuse to launch an attack on Ukraine.The US official said intelligence showed the Russian military plans to begin its activities “several weeks before a military invasion, which could begin between mid-January and mid-February.” Advertisement     “We saw this playbook in 2014 with Crimea,” the official added, referring to Moscow’s annexation of that peninsula and the subsequent war it fomented in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.US intelligence, said the official, indicates Russia has already recruited a group of operatives to carry out a false-flag operation in eastern Ukraine.“The operatives are trained in urban warfare and in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia’s own proxy-forces,” the official said.The official said further information indicated that “Russian influence actors” working for state-run news outlets and on social media are hard at work fabricating “Ukrainian provocations” to justify a new Russian intervention and sow discord in Ukraine.“For example, Russian officials and influence actors are emphasizing narratives about the deterioration of human rights in Ukraine and the increased militancy of Ukrainian leaders,” the official said.“These media narratives also blame the West for escalating tension, highlight humanitarian issues in Ukraine that Russian intervention could solve, and promote Russian patriotism to encourage domestic support for military action.”The Biden administration told BuzzFeed News that in December it tracked Russian-language content on social media “covering all three of these narratives” and saw its output increase to an average of about 3,500 posts per day — a 200% increase from the daily average in November.The US warnings came as a massive cyberattack hit dozens of Ukrainian government websites. The hackers behind the attack posted a message warning Ukraine to “be afraid and expect worse.”Ukrainian government officials told BuzzFeed News that it was too soon to know for sure who was behind the attack, but they pointed the finger at Moscow.

“She was never around me much in that time so why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense ???” she asked.
 


“If you were me, you might understand asking for 13 years for remixes to go into a small venue show and on tours !!! 13 years later they assign me as the MOTHER OF ALL ... heart of gold ... Britney sitting there seeing a 15 minute performance of everything I have ever wanted ... But see, I always was the bigger person,” she continued.“They all got to DO IT and PLAY ME and I always sat there and took it. But see, now it’s a joke … the last thing I would ever do is ask for what was just given to her !!! So yes, they did ruin my dreams,” she wrote.“I do remember asking my sister why she did that when she knew I was waiting to change my show and her only words were “Well, it wasn’t my idea” ... Hope your book does well, Jamie Lynn !!!” Britney added.
 


“I know you’re going through a lot and I never want to diminish that, but I also can’t diminish myself,” she added.
 


“[Because] now it’s getting harder for me to rationalize to my oldest daughter why our family continues to get death threats, as a result of their aunt’s vague and accusatory posts, especially when we know she could tell the truth, and put an end to all of it in one second if she wanted to,” the statement continued.
 


“I’ve worked hard since before I was even a teenager, and I’ve built my career in spite of just being someone’s little sister,” she added.
 


“I’m speaking my truth to heal my traumas, so I can close this chapter and move forward and I wish my sister could do the same,” she said. Advertisement     “No matter what comes, I will always love my big sister, and be here for her. It’s time to put an end to the unhealthy chaos that has controlled my life for so long,” she wrote.
 


Some suggested that, in light of her comments about the weight her last name carries, Jamie Lynn might be attempting to distance herself from the Spears name considering the recent backlash.  Advertisement

WASHINGTON — America may not have to wait until 2024 to witness the next attempt to undo a free and fair election.Any candidate for the 435 House seats or 34 Senate seats open in 2022 could follow Donald Trump’s playbook for challenging a lost election, which Republicans have spent the last 14 months building out. And they would have a major advantage over the former president: Overthrowing congressional election results is actually very simple. There’s no need to deal with the Electoral College or state officials across the country. You just need to convince a majority of politicians in either chamber.The House and Senate have absolute authority over their membership. And the House speaker can simply decide not to seat a candidate whose election has been called into question, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself considered just last year. Advertisement  All that is required to ignore or overturn a congressional election is a move away from a century of political norms at a time many politicians are actively undermining them.Republicans in and out of Congress continue to prop up the lie that the last election was stolen from Trump and continue to make challenging certified election results routine. After 147 Republicans in Congress voted not to certify the 2020 election results, legislators in four states have launched so-called election “audits” of their own. Election deniers are running to be the top elections officials in at least 12 states in 2022. And Trump’s most vociferous supporters in the party are pushing legislation in statehouses this year to make it easier to force partisan audits in future elections up and down the ballot.While those efforts could certainly help Republicans in the next presidential election, they could take advantage this year of the new normal they’ve created. Poll after poll shows that roughly two-thirds of Republican voters still believe that President Joe Biden’s election was illegitimate and a December Washington Post survey shows that 57% of them are not confident that the 2022 vote will be counted accurately. The question isn’t whether another Republican will cry voter fraud and try to overturn a fair congressional election, it’s when — and whether party leaders will step in to help them.Over the past century, it has been extremely rare for Congress to overturn state-certified elections. Modern Congresses have tended to defer to the states and the courts to sort out contested elections, Princeton University professor of politics Keith Whittington said. But in the 19th century, it was much more common for the Senate and House to settle disputes themselves, with a majority vote being the ultimate arbiter. Advertisement  With state election boards under siege for the past year by Trump and his supporters, the standard of Congress leaving it to the states could soon be over.“You can imagine either chamber wanting to go back to its roots,” Whittington said.Trump remains the X factor hanging over the midterms. He is encouraging Republicans to keep false voter fraud claims alive in 2022, and a good number of the party’s voters expect their candidates to push back on election results. In the Washington Post survey, nearly a third of Republicans said they were not confident that officials in their states would accept the results of the 2022 election — and that’s in states controlled mostly by Republicans. Asked about states controlled by mostly Democrats, that number shot up to 56%.It’s easiest to see how this could play out in the House, where hundreds of races present more radical members with more opportunity. Say a handful of Republicans lose House races in November and claim that there was widespread voter fraud in their districts. Republicans are considered the favorites to win the majority back in 2022, meaning the next speaker — perhaps current Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy — could come under intense pressure to “stop the steal” in races across the country. He — and the rest of the Republicans in Congress — would likely be flooded with calls demanding “full forensic audits.”For this scenario to play out, Republicans have to win back a majority in the House of Representatives. That would allow them to elect one of their own because the speaker of the House has the power to seat — or not seat — any member in a contested race. Democrats could challenge that decision, but Republicans would only need a majority vote to uphold it. Advertisement  Usually there are more steps in the process. Under the Federal Contested Election Act of 1969, a losing candidate can appeal to the Committee on House Administration to start an investigation, for which there are no real ground rules, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Center. The committee can send a delegation to the disputed district to recount the ballots themselves. They could conduct their own quasi-audit and impound voting machines and examine voter registration records. They could hold a trial, with both candidates presenting evidence for why they should be seated. And they can make up whatever rules they’d like about which ballots to count and which not to count, regardless of state law. The courts, historically, have stayed out of this; the Constitution guarantees that each chamber of Congress “shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members.”The House doesn’t even need a candidate to complain to kick off this process — any member or member-elect can object to the seating of another member. It’s even possible, though very unusual, for the House to investigate a congressional election because of a complaint by a single voter.“The Constitution is even thinner on this than it is on what impeachment would look like,” Whittington said.Ultimately, a majority vote on the House floor will settle who gets seated. The Senate also has total control over who gets seated and how to resolve disputes. Though contested statewide elections are less frequent, and the Senate has far fewer races to begin with, the majority would have the ultimate power to settle a disputed race. Advertisement  Neither party is talking about pursuing electoral challenges right now, but both suspect the other may do so. “I don’t trust Republicans to play fair, period,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said.“This is a disturbing potential implication of the electoral paranoia and lunacy that has been unleashed on the land by Donald Trump,” said Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who sits on both the House Administration Committee and the committee investigating Jan. 6. “Anyone can try to create a conspiracy and spread it like wildfire on the internet without any facts at all. And then politicians in the GOP get cornered and feel as if they have to commit to a certain conspiracy theory or they’re going to get attacked by Trump and his followers.”McCarthy downplayed this possibility while entering the House chamber Tuesday, saying that there are often close races but his concern is Democrats trying to swing the results.Republicans point to Pelosi as the one who is upending norms by using her majority to kick Republicans off committees. The Democrat-controlled House voted to remove Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar from committee assignments last year for threatening or abusive comments they’d made.McCarthy also referenced the last time the House overturned a race, in 1985, when then-speaker Tip O’Neill and House Democrats handed a contested congressional seat to one of their own. In what has become known as a fight over Indiana’s “Bloody Eighth” district, House Democrats conducted their own recount, following tabulation errors and claims of vote irregularities. Republicans claimed Democrats were stealing the election and staged a walkout. “You always want to make sure you never end up to that Bloody Eighth when the Democrats stole the race,” McCarthy said. Advertisement  Pelosi openly considered using the House’s powers one year ago when a Democrat challenged her loss in an Iowa race that was decided by just six votes. Although the state certified Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks’ win over Democrat Rita Hart, Hart appealed to the House to investigate. Pelosi mulled seating Hart, but dropped it after several Democrats raised concerns and Hart withdrew her challenge.“If I wanted to be unfair, I wouldn’t have seated the Republican from Iowa because that was my right on the opening day. I would have just said, they’re not seated, and that would have been my right as speaker to do,” Pelosi said at the time.Republicans say Pelosi only backed down because she already had a majority secured. But if the 2022 midterms result in a close election where the majority hinges on only a seat or two? There could be chaos. Members from one party could object to the seating of members in another to block a majority, leading to retaliatory challenges in the other direction. It could take weeks to sort out who ultimately controls the chamber. As with much of the American political system, the rules offer no clear guideline for resolution if norms are abandoned.Republican Rep. Randy Weber said he believes state results should be upheld, but one side trying a power grab would be met with retaliation. If that happens with the majority in the balance, he said, “Get your seat early. Bring your popcorn.” ● Advertisement

This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.The North Star Boys first appeared on my TikTok feed last summer, exiting an elevator and throwing nonchalant but sexy glances at the camera. Then ripping off their shirts. Standing in a line sucking on lollipops. Eating whipped cream. Fabricating secret admirer videos about themselves. Every time, I would be introduced to their content via someone’s satirical take on their Horny Behavior. Advertisement     This collective of seven Asian American content creators first rose to prominence for “go girl give us nothing” seductive TikToks, garnering a large fanbase by pushing the boundaries of fan fiction and TikTok’s community guidelines. The North Star Boys’ account currently boasts 4.8 million followers, while individual members like Oliver Moy have around 11.6 million.According to the group’s YouTube channel, their mission is simply “to be an inspiration to Asian Americans.” Euphemistically, they’ve become known as the “pick your Asian” group, a way for Asian men to fetishize themselves for white audiences. But recently these purveyors of thirsty heterosexual Asian content found themselves in political controversy after they posed in front of a wall with the slogan “Stop Asian Hate.”
 


The Stop Asian Hate movement gained traction in 2021 after a rise in racist and violent attacks against Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was largely personified by rallies organized across the country to protest the brutality and show solidarity, particularly in the wake of Vicha Ratanapakdee’s death as well as the Atlanta spa shooting.Which is why followers didn’t love it when the North Star Boys used it as a backdrop for their latest group photo. “it’s giving kendall jenner pepsi,” one commenter wrote. “i’d rather be called a slur,” another said.
 


The viral photo also spawned several TikToks making light of it, including one by Alex Lee, 20, a student at the University of Southern California.“It was comical, and then once you think about it more, maybe a little more concerning,” he told me. “This term reached new heights in its meaning during COVID-19, when Asian elders and community members were really under attack, physically and verbally abused for our identity. But these seven guys are looking cute in front of it.” Advertisement     In response to the uproar, the influencers posted two response videos, on TikTok and YouTube. “That is not a thirst trap. And we are not activists, nor do we try to be,” said Oliver Moy, his fellow Boys seated around him.
 


The caption on TikTok read: “To those who are mocking us with your TikToks, I want to ask you to ask yourself, ‘What are you doing for the movement?’”And, well, the commenters mocked that too.
 


“When influencers use these hashtags as a way to prove they’re ‘woke,’ without clarifying the action items they’re following to benefit the movement, people lose sight of the meaning,” Lee said. “The words lose impact, and that becomes detrimental to the purpose of these terms.” Advertisement     The founders of Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of organizations who founded and popularized the initial hashtag, declined to respond directly about the North Star Boys’ controversial post, but provided a statement about the movement’s work tracking Asian hate crime incidents.“It's vital we continue to push for real solutions through investment in civil rights, community resources and education, including ethnic studies in schools,” they said.Influencers taking lukewarm, Instagram-friendly stands against targeted racial violence is not a new phenomenon (remember the black squares?). The pressures of social media aesthetics have led these efforts to be diluted into general phrases, the action items left behind. Male influencers doing a sexy walk with pumpkins on their heads is not really the inspiring Asian representation I had asked for.“You need to tell your teammate when they make a bad decision on the court,” Lee said. “We have the same goal as Asian Americans. I don’t think the North Star Boys had bad intentions. I really don’t think they were trying to be malicious or derogatory. But they just had lackluster execution.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the North Star Boys collectively said:We as Asian Americans stand in solidarity with our community, and only want to use our platform to promote positivity and inclusivity. It's not just Asian Americans out there that we want to inspire, but everyone should feel that they can talk about what they're passionate about, be heard, and more importantly feel seen and represented culturally when they get on social media or watch TV. We are always so thankful for all of our supporters for having our back. We see all your messages and appreciate the love.I mean, public figures supporting a movement is a nice gesture, but the state of our community may need a little more than that.

KYIV – After days of unsuccessful negotiations between the US, NATO, and Russia, hackers took down dozens of Ukrainian government websites and posted an ominous warning on several for the country to “be afraid and expect worse.”The cyberattack occurred overnight on Thursday and Friday morning, and it took down more than a dozen official websites, disrupting government work and raising questions about whether Russia was signaling that a new offensive against Ukraine was getting underway. Advertisement     Oleh Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, told BuzzFeed News that government specialists were working to restore the websites Friday morning and the Ukrainian Cyberpolice Department had opened a criminal investigation. “It’s too early to draw conclusions,” he said. ""We are assessing the damage caused by the attack.""But some in Ukraine’s government see Russian fingerprints all over the attack and are already blaming Moscow, which has massed around 100,000 soldiers near the Ukrainian borders and threatened a “military response” against its neighbor unless the US and NATO concede to its demands.“It’s pretty obvious [Russia is responsible] because hardly anyone else has the motive for such actions,” a Ukrainian official told BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak on the sensitive matter.Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff, during an online event with the Atlantic Council think tank, stopped short of accusing Russia of the cyberattack by name but suggested that it had a role in it. “It’s one of the potential parts of the destabilization of Ukraine,” he said. Advertisement     Officials in Russia didn't immediately return a request for comment.Ukrainian and US officials have warned that if Russia were to launch a fresh invasion of Ukraine it would likely do so in conjunction with cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that the US intelligence community has information that suggests Russia is laying the groundwork to fabricate a pretext for invading Ukraine.A source with knowledge of recent cybersecurity initiatives in Ukraine told BuzzFeed News hours before the cyberattack that Kyiv and Washington had recently seen a “substantial uptick” in Russian cyber activity targeting Ukrainian systems and planting malware.The source said there was evidence to show the malware was designed to be planted and remain idle until a command would be given by the hackers behind it. “So they don’t need to hack anything when the [shooting] war starts. … The hack already happened,” the source explained. “They just push the button.”“We call this preparing the battlefield,” the source said.
 


Most of the Ukrainian websites targeted late Thursday and early Friday registered error messages when visited. But hackers replaced the homepage on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ website with a message written in Ukrainian, Russian, and Polish. “[Every] Ukrainian!” it said. “All information about you has become public, be afraid and expect the worst. This is for your past, present and future.” Advertisement     The message also included references to Ukrainian nationalist fighters in World War II and atrocities committed by them against Poles at the time, which has been a point of tension between the two countries despite their close relationship. Some Ukrainians saw that as a ruse to blame Warsaw for the attack.The Cyberpolice Department said it is working with the State Special Communications Service and the Security Service of Ukraine “to collect digital evidence and identify those involved in the cyber attacks.” No personal or official government data was stolen in the attack, it added.Ukraine has been the target of several large-scale cyberattacks since 2014, the year Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and fomented the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has repeatedly insisted that the attacks are part of Moscow’s “hybrid war” — a combination of cyberwarfare, disinformation, and conventional military warfare — against it. Russia has denied responsibility for the cyberattacks.Past incidents saw attacks on the Ukrainian power grid, government agencies, transportation systems, and businesses. A 2017 attack known as NotPetya emanated in Kyiv but quickly spread to companies across the globe, causing significant damage.The New York Times reported last month that the US and UK had sent experts to Kyiv to help Ukraine on the cyber front, foreseeing the likelihood of cyberattacks as Russia ratcheted up tensions with its neighbor. Advertisement     President Vladimir Putin has gathered some 100,000 troops and heavy artillery around the border of Ukraine, raising concern in Kyiv and Western capitals that the Kremlin might be preparing to invade anew. Moscow has denied it is prepping for an attack and said that what it does with its military within its borders is its business.High-stakes discussions between the US, NATO, and Russia in Geneva, Brussels, and Vienna this week failed to secure a deal to see Moscow pull back its troops and military equipment.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters Thursday that Washington and NATO “are not ready to meet"" Russia's ""key requirements.” Among those is a guarantee that Ukraine can never join the western military alliance. The US and Ukraine have called the demand a non-starter.Ryabkov and other Russian government officials said further talks would be useless.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an ominous warning following a meeting with the Russians in Brussels on Wednesday. “There is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe,” he said.

President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms, in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country.“Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one,"" he said. ""We missed this time. We missed this time.” Advertisement     After traveling to Georgia earlier this week — in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there — Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules, which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills.But after his meeting with senators, the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.“I hope we can get this done, but the honest to god answer is I don’t know whether we can get this done,” Biden said.Normally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate. Democrats have only a 50–50 majority, including the tiebreaker, and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority. Advertisement     At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, oppose this plan, dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need. Sinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills, but not changing the Senate rules to pass them. She said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the “disease of division” that has broken American politics.Democrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway, knowing they don’t have the numbers. It’s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose, but Democrats say this issue is unique.“I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here. You’re either for democracy or you’re not,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said. “It’s important to have, frankly, every one of us on the record.”Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats’ doomed push.“It makes perfect political sense,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “If you’re Joe Biden, you’ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power. If you’re Chuck Schumer, you’ve got to call the question or you’re going to get a primary. If you’re in a purple or a red state, it’s probably good politics for you. So this is perfectly good politics for both sides.”The voting rights package, named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis, would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions, create nationwide minimum early voting day standards, make Election Day a federal holiday, and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups. Advertisement     Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive. Voting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia, where several of those bills were enacted, boycotted Biden’s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures.Several of those leaders, from groups including Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia.Seemingly in response to that criticism, in an email to those leaders on Wednesday, the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday “to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation” before thanking them for their “work and advocacy on this issue.”On Thursday, two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president’s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don’t have a chance of passing right now.“Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand,” said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. “We have no luxury of, or privilege of, delaying this any longer. And so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.” Advertisement     Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway.“He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want,"" Ufot said. ""I’m not in a position to figure that out, but he can, so I think that feels like a next step.""Ufot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority.“We care deeply about this issue, because fuck these elected officials, we care about our families, we care about our communities, and that doesn't go away,” Ufot said.“We're not going anywhere. And we're never going to shut up about this.”

276,"The attack comes as Russia is massing 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border.","


As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

277,"After his meeting with senators, President Biden indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.","


President Joe Biden acknowledged for the first time Thursday that Democrats will likely fail to pass voting rights reforms, in the wake of dozens of restrictive voting laws passed by Republicans across the country.“Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time we can come back and try the second one,"" he said. ""We missed this time. We missed this time.” Advertisement     After traveling to Georgia earlier this week — in spite of the protests of several voting rights leaders on the ground there — Biden visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to make a push for Democratic senators to amend filibuster rules, which would have paved the way for two landmark voting reform bills.But after his meeting with senators, the president indicated that changes to the filibuster rules — and passing the voting rights package — are not looking likely.“I hope we can get this done, but the honest to god answer is I don’t know whether we can get this done,” Biden said.Normally a bill requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and pass the Senate. Democrats have only a 50–50 majority, including the tiebreaker, and hoped to carve out a narrow exemption to the filibuster to allow voting rights bills to pass with a simple majority. Advertisement     At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, oppose this plan, dropping Democrats short of the votes they would need. Sinema gave a speech Thursday morning saying she supports the voting rights bills, but not changing the Senate rules to pass them. She said nuking the filibuster would contribute to the “disease of division” that has broken American politics.Democrats appear poised to forge ahead with a vote anyway, knowing they don’t have the numbers. It’s exceedingly rare in the Senate for a majority party to set up a vote it knows it will lose, but Democrats say this issue is unique.“I think there are certain fundamentals that are beyond the usual sort of strategy approach around here. You’re either for democracy or you’re not,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said. “It’s important to have, frankly, every one of us on the record.”Republicans are taking a more grounded view of the Democrats’ doomed push.“It makes perfect political sense,” Sen. Lindsey Graham said. “If you’re Joe Biden, you’ve got to show the left that you did everything in your power. If you’re Chuck Schumer, you’ve got to call the question or you’re going to get a primary. If you’re in a purple or a red state, it’s probably good politics for you. So this is perfectly good politics for both sides.”The voting rights package, named after the late civil rights icon and former member of Congress John Lewis, would roll back dozens of state-level voting access restrictions, create nationwide minimum early voting day standards, make Election Day a federal holiday, and allow the courts and federal government to intervene if a state passes restrictions that target minority groups. Advertisement     Last year, Republicans put in place 33 laws across 19 states that make voting more restrictive. Voting rights advocates on the ground in Georgia, where several of those bills were enacted, boycotted Biden’s speech in Atlanta on Tuesday, instead calling on him to stay in DC and get the legislation passed that would curb those state measures.Several of those leaders, from groups including Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said they would expect Biden to take action to push the bills along in the days after the speech so that Georgia.Seemingly in response to that criticism, in an email to those leaders on Wednesday, the White House said the president would attend the caucus meeting on Thursday “to continue to make the case for voting rights as the party considers a vote on election reform and voting legislation” before thanking them for their “work and advocacy on this issue.”On Thursday, two of the Georgia voting rights leaders who boycotted the president’s Tuesday speech said they still want to see a vote by Monday even if the bills don’t have a chance of passing right now.“Our expectation is that every senator is put on record as to where they stand,” said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. “We have no luxury of, or privilege of, delaying this any longer. And so we fully expect leader Schumer to be consistent in his word in holding this vote sooner rather than later.” Advertisement     Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said she expects Biden to work on Sinema and Manchin to make headway.“He needs to find out what Manchin and Sinema want,"" Ufot said. ""I’m not in a position to figure that out, but he can, so I think that feels like a next step.""Ufot and Woodall said they will continue to put pressure on the White House to make these reforms a priority.“We care deeply about this issue, because fuck these elected officials, we care about our families, we care about our communities, and that doesn't go away,” Ufot said.“We're not going anywhere. And we're never going to shut up about this.”

278,"Having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, from criticisms of her partying to speculation about plastic surgery, Tara Reid wants everyone to just move on.","


For years, Facebook moderators employed by third-party contractors have sought to expose poor working conditions, and their dissent grew louder during the pandemic as many were forced to return to the office with little to no safety net. But Spanish-language moderators say they face even worse treatment than their English-focused colleagues.
 


At the Richardson, Texas, office of Genpact, a Meta subcontractor, Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they’ve been required to report to the office since April 2021, despite the emergence of both Delta and Omicron variants that caused COVID infections to spike across the US. Throughout this time, they said, moderators reviewing English-language content have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.“Being in the office … has been nothing short of a nightmare,” one moderator said.BuzzFeed News spoke to three members of Genpact’s so-called Mexican market team who described a pattern of inequitable treatment of Spanish-language moderators. All of these individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity as Genpact requires them to sign nondisclosure agreements and they feared for their jobs. They said that in addition to reporting to the office for the last nine months while their English-language counterparts could work from home, Spanish-language moderators are held to unrealistic performance standards and are not compensated for working in two languages, which they say is more time-consuming. In addition, they face the pressures of managing a Facebook market that has long been criticized as under-moderated amid the threat of active COVID cases.Genpact spokesperson Danielle D’Angelo declined to comment on all of the specific claims made by Spanish-language moderators, including the claim that its Mexican market team was not allowed to work from home while other teams were rotated out.“We would like to stress that employee safety is our top priority and that has and will remain so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” D’Angelo said. “Any return to office decisions that are made in alignment with client needs are done with best safety and health practices in place and in accordance with local regulations. In all of our workplace locations, including our Richardson, TX office, we follow best-in-class safety standards, which includes frequent antigen testing.”On Thursday, managers at Genpact’s Richardson site reportedly told company agents that it has scrapped plans to reopen at 50% capacity on Jan. 31 due to the Omicron variant. Spanish-language moderators said this change does not affect them, and they will continue reporting to the office. Genpact declined to comment on when it intends to reopen, and at what capacity.In late June, Genpact leadership sent an email to one of the English-language moderation groups allowed to rotate out of the office, thanking them for their ""continued dedication and responsiveness."" The email said they would return to working from home on July 26.Spanish-language moderators told BuzzFeed News they received no such email. Days after English-language moderators were told they could go back home, “[managers] told us we were a specialized queue, and that our job could not be done outside of the office,” one moderator said, noting that the Mexican market often involves moderating a deluge of particularly graphic content. Facebook declined to comment on the complaints of its Spanish-language moderators, referring BuzzFeed News to Genpact — a strategy it has taken time and again when addressing the concerns of people who make their living moderating Facebook content.Since returning to the Richardson office, employees have grown increasingly fearful for their safety. Moderators told BuzzFeed News that 30 COVID cases were reported to staff by management in December, and that no updates have been communicated since then. Meanwhile, workers say their colleagues continue to test positive for COVID, citing two cases on one floor last week. Genpact declined to comment on the number of COVID cases in its office or how frequently it reports these cases to staff.On Dec. 22, a dozen Spanish-language moderators left the office en masse after learning through the grapevine that a sick colleague may have exposed them to the virus. Since workers claim that Genpact does not currently offer its moderators paid sick leave, they used PTO to self-isolate. Genpact declined to comment on whether its moderators are provided paid sick leave.Despite being named for the Mexican market, this team reviews Facebook and Instagram content posted in Spanish by users across most of Latin America as well, moderators said. As of 2018, there were 84 million Facebook users in Mexico, and tens of millions more using WhatsApp. In Latino and Spanish-speaking communities, Facebook has been a powerful vector of misinformation, shaping the public’s perception of topics such as COVID, election politics, and Black Lives Matter. But researchers studying misinformation told the Guardian that compared to English-language posts, harmful content posted in Spanish is removed less frequently.
 


Members told BuzzFeed News that Genpact began building this team in early 2020, initially sourcing volunteers from other existing departments.“Genpact made everyone who has a remotely Hispanic-sounding name take a Spanish test, and if they failed they were asked to take it again,” one moderator told BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity, fearing they could face retaliation for speaking publicly about internal company matters.Employees claim that moderators not fluent in Spanish were forced into the role as a result and that many failed to meet performance expectations and were subsequently fired. Currently, the Mexican market team consists of roughly 50 people.But even workers fluent in Spanish feel beaten down by what they characterized as unreasonable standards. For example, moderators are expected to maintain an 85% accuracy rate while sticking to a 66-second “handle time,” or time frame for making decisions on pieces of content. While these thresholds might be sensible for one language, navigating dual languages can take more time. Moderators say they have to translate Facebook guidelines, which are only disseminated in English, into Spanish before applying them. A large number of posts by users in Mexico and across Latin America also contain English, they added, forcing them to switch between languages regularly. Genpact declined to comment on how Spanish-language moderators are evaluated and paid. Facebook did not respond to a query about the language in which its guidelines are provided.The pandemic has caused Facebook moderators at several outsourcing firms to organize around issues such as paid sick leave, hazard pay, and the class system dividing contract workers from salaried tech employees. Last week, Accenture suddenly allowed its Facebook moderators to work from home after originally ordering them back to the office, following a BuzzFeed News inquiry.Though Facebook has never publicly revealed how many users it has throughout Latin America, its platform and apps function as vital utilities for citizens of many of these countries. That pressure is felt by Genpact’s Spanish-language moderators, who said that despite the outsize importance of their jobs, they’re the smallest team in the office.Facebook spokesperson Kadia Koroma said the company uses a “combination of technology and people to keep content that breaks our rules off of our platform, and while AI has made progress in this space, people are a key part of our safety efforts.” The company said that Spanish is one of the most common languages used on Facebook and that Spanish-language reviews are conducted 24 hours per day at several sites across the world.Moderators who returned to the office in April assumed it was due to Mexico’s midterm elections, which were held in June. “We figured, OK, let the election pass,” one moderator said. Throughout 2021, English-language moderators had been rotating in and out. The Mexican market team figured it would be the same for them.“Then a week before we were supposed to be rotated out, we got an email saying, ‘Thank you for the hard work, but unfortunately the Mexican market is going to stay in place,’” they added. Facebook declined to comment on how it interacts with subcontractors managing specific moderation markets.“We know these jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams,” Koroma said.

KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI — “Stop the car!” a police officer yells in the video, pulling out his gun as a silver Audi minivan kicks it into reverse, swerving away from him. The officer runs after the car.“Get out, get out, get out,” the officer says, his words blending together. He aims his gun with one hand at the Black man driving and holds his radio with the other.A fast-moving situation. An officer with a drawn weapon. A Black man suspected of a crime. Bystanders screaming at the police that the man behind the wheel has a mental condition. And a video broadcast on social media. Time and time again the world has seen these videos end in tragedy. Advertisement  But no one is shot in this video. At the tensest moment, a soundtrack amps up music that would fit in a Fast & Furious trailer. Without incident, the officer gets the driver out of the car and takes him to a hospital for mental health treatment.This video, which was uploaded in July 2020 and has more than 87,000 views, is one of hundreds the Miami Police Department has put out since it started vlogging in 2015 (the most popular has 3.4 million views). Miami is just an early adopter of a renewed tactic. Now, police departments across the nation are producing slick videos, pushing a “good cop” image after years of outrage over shootings, many captured on video and published to social media, and the resulting protests demanding accountability. The New York Police Department has posted over 800 videos to its channel, including web series called Beyond the Badge and Neighborhood Policing. The Los Angeles Police Department regularly posts bodycam and security footage, sometimes cutting it together with a moving score, like this video of an officer providing first aid to a man injured during riots after an LA Lakers championship game.The videos continue the tradition, popularized by shows like Cops and Live PD, of glorifying police work via highly edited, suspenseful, “documentary”-style entertainment. But these are coming from the departments themselves, with police employees editing and uploading the clips right to YouTube. A new form of “copaganda,” as activists refer to it. There has been a boom in these shows and channels over the past 19 months, after both Cops and Live PD — criticized for years for glorifying police work and perpetuating racial stereotypes — were canceled amid the summer 2020 protests. (Cops is now making a return on Fox Nation.)Current and former spokespeople for five different police departments said these videos help with “public education,” “community outreach,” recruiting, and morale.But most critically some officials say they are made to counteract the dominant online presence of the police accountability and reform movements of the past eight years. Advertisement  When video of George Floyd being choked to death started circulating around the world, “every police department that was watching that in the country went. Oh, F.U.C.K. is this going to hit us?” said Lauri Stevens, the founder of SMILE, an annual conference, awards, and training outfit for law enforcement social media use.“And it did, and they knew it. They knew it from the minute it happened, it’s going to come down on us.”The reaction among departments was an age-old tactic strengthened by new technology: Drive the narrative you want to get out.Still, some of the officers who make the videos are reckoning with their involvement in them. Take Officer Malcolm Whitelaw of the Kansas City Police Department, who was at the vanguard of his department’s video strategy. He’s also grappling with being the public face of the very system that’s caused him fear in the past.
 


I followed Whitelaw for a few days this summer as he made and edited a video about applying to become a police officer. The goal was to boost recruitment. Advertisement  We walked around police communications and media headquarters in Kansas City, the department recruitment office, and the police academy as he filmed in selfie mode, explaining how to apply and what someone should expect if they are accepted into the academy.“People tell me my videos look like Live PD, but I don’t really think so,” Whitelaw said when the camera stopped rolling. “I’m still kind of figuring out my style.”Whitelaw, who is Black, is a 29-year-old former marketing student who has been on the force for six years. He’s hulking and friendly, with a squinty smile.Whitelaw loves working as a police officer, but, he told me repeatedly, he doesn’t consider it his identity the way he believes many of his colleagues do. It’s just a job, he said. At the end of the day, the badge comes off. Then he’s just Malcolm.He was a patrol officer before he started making videos for the department at the beginning of 2021. The videos were his idea, inspired in part, though maybe subconsciously, he conceded, by his experience patrolling last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.“As I was standing there, there were some girls, like, yelling at me, and I kind of got confused because this is a young white girl telling me that I don’t understand what it means to be Black,” Whitelaw said, sitting at a conference table with his two white bosses, who were nodding along. “And I’m like, I have more experience in this field than you.”Later, during a break from shooting a video in the recruitment office, away from his colleagues, we discussed the issue further.“I’m a police officer, and I’m also Black. No confusion there. And so my experience as a police officer is very different sometimes than those that don’t share my skin complexion. Because, well, where do we police? Right? We police in areas with people that look like me,” Whitelaw said, his voice lowering an octave. Advertisement  For Whitelaw, and for the Black protesters he was patrolling, dealing with police hostility and brutality had been a reality their whole lives.When Whitelaw was a sophomore in high school, living just outside of Kansas City, he said, he was walking home from school when suddenly an officer pulled up and, gun out, stopped him. Whitelaw didn’t know what was happening and the officer didn’t explain, he said, but kept telling him to stay where he was. Soon, several more cops pulled up around him. They held him there until they figured out he wasn’t the guy they were looking for.“I matched the description,” Whitelaw added. He was scared, and his mother was furious.“Growing up, I didn’t like the police, I wouldn’t talk to the police,” Whitelaw said. “My head was hardwired like that. That was a huge hurdle to get over because I had all the same thoughts as the people that don’t like the police. You know, I had started working for a department” — he later clarified his encounter with police was with a nearby department — “that pulled me over at gunpoint.”Whitelaw said he regularly encounters people who still think that way, who see him as a traitor for being a Black police officer. Because of that, he said, he finds himself having to “exist in that place as a human being, not so much getting caught up in my skin color.”“There’s people who look at me and they hate me that much more because I’m Black. ‘How dare you?’ You know, like, ‘How dare you be a police, you know what they’ve done to us.’ That’s what people are thinking,” Whitelaw said. Advertisement  “It’s sometimes so disheartening because it’s like, I’m the best person to have right here, you know. Because I’m not looking at you because of who you — because of this situation,” he stumbled over his words. “I’m looking beyond that. We can handle our business, and I’m gonna treat you as a person you want to talk to with respect.”He hopes to bring some of this understanding into his videos. Whitelaw has been obsessed with YouTube since he was a teen, fantasizing about creating his own videos and becoming a sensation on the platform. After watching Miami’s police vlogs religiously, he decided that his department should do something similar.The chief approved it, and Whitelaw’s been on special assignment in the media unit since the beginning of 2021. When I was with him in August, he said that so far the office had given him almost free rein. He taught himself video editing and about equipment online and invested a significant chunk of his own money (though he wouldn’t say how much) in cameras and lenses. The department put out its first vlog in March.
 


After the first couple of YouTube videos, the KCPD YouTube channel had a 1,000% increase in viewership — this is according to Whitelaw — and saw 1,400 new subscribers in the first few weeks. Things have steadied since then. As of mid-January, the KCPD had published its ninth video and had nearly 7,000 subscribers. Whitelaw also recently launched a KCPD TikTok page, hoping to reach a younger, wider audience. Advertisement  Right after the channel launched, he started getting inundated with requests from officers in other departments to be featured on the videos. Pro-police commenters leave positive feedback and aspiring officers use the forum to ask Whitelaw questions in the comments about how to become a cop. He has even started getting recognized in public, he said.Whitelaw’s hope for these videos is that they show the benefits of community policing, not just to the public but to current and future officers. Officers, with burnout, social pressures, and a high-intensity work environment, sometimes need a reminder of why they got into the force, Whitelaw said.“As police officers, a lot of times we have to be so rigid, right?” Whitelaw said. “We’re dealing with, you know, traumatic events, and sometimes when you’re out there, you kind of forget to be a person. So that’s what I try to get people to feel and remind them: You are a person.”He added that it doesn’t hurt that the videos help boost morale, by making officers feel badass, “seeing themselves with cool music and, you know, different shooting angles, and seeing how much fun people are having.”
 


While I was with the KCPD, Whitelaw made a video about the testing process for applicants to get into the police academy. It came after the chief requested that the KCPD up its recruiting game.The plan was to follow the latest group of applicants as they took the exams. Whitelaw gave his followers a tour of the academy’s training facilities. He walked backward along an indoor running track, filming in selfie mode and breathing hard as he talked through his KCPD-branded mask.“Us police officers, we try to de-escalate using the best de-escalation tactics, which you will learn at the police academy,” Whitelaw said, walking up to a punching bag. “But, you know, life is very unpredictable.” He lightly punched it three times, then walked over to a life-size, silver, rubber figure with red shapes marking its chest, stomach, crotch, and knees. This dummy, named “Numb John,” is for baton training, he explained.Next, we walked downstairs, past large cardboard printouts of a white, bald man with a goatee in a fighting position. He was covered in hundreds of tiny holes on his back, stomach, and crotch (stun gun practice, Whitelaw remarked). Then we entered the hand-to-hand combat training room. The room looked like a karate dōjō. On one wall hung a “thin blue line” American flag, and on another hung two black-and-white pictures of officers putting people in, apparently, chokeholds. Between them was a banner reading “‘Come to the Party People’ - Jim Lindell.” Advertisement  
 


(Lindell invented a controversial alternative to chokeholds, which the KCPD has argued is less dangerous despite repeated calls from local organizers to ban the use of the restraint, though the department has refused.)We entered the exam room. Most of the 22 people applying to join the police academy had already taken their seats. The majority were white and male.The officers allowed me to take a quick poll of the applicants. I asked if anyone had watched Whitelaw’s videos for the KCPD, and four people raised their hands. I asked if anyone regularly watched YouTube videos from other police departments or about policing, and eight of the applicants raised their hands — all men, mostly white.“I spend a lot of time on YouTube watching videos about what it’s like” to be a police officer, Jay Humfeld, 42, told me. He’d been thinking about becoming a cop for a while, but watching Whitelaw’s videos — as well as Live PD and other police content fed to him by YouTube and Facebook’s algorithms — helped push him to actually apply. Advertisement  Once YouTube’s algorithm learns you’re interested in this genre, it’ll take you from officers in Houston using a heat-tech drone to find a fugitive hiding in a sewer system to a montage of police dogs in the Kansas City K-9 unit opening car doors with their snouts to a trans officer in Seattle standing in front of a skyline and telling her story. They’re largely a behind-the-scenes look at the job — the action, glamor, humor, and camaraderie. But they all share a message: We are the good cops.Two of the other applicants, a 28-year-old named Juan and a 22-year-old who asked me not to use his name, both of whom have military backgrounds, said they’d also watched Live PD and Cops, as well as videos from the KCPD and other police departments. They said YouTube fed them both kinds of videos interchangeably. The 22-year-old said he used to watch the Miami Police Department videos and thought they were “kinda cool.”“Police departments are making videos about what they do every day, and the different kinds of police officers like SWAT and vice, just everybody, it’s cool to learn about,” he said. He added that the main reason he was applying was that his uncle had just retired from the KCPD the week before.Juan estimated that he watches about 30 to 40 minutes of these videos a week unless he gets in a “scroll hole” and loses track of time. Entering the police force is a common career move for people with a military background, he said, but the videos also helped him understand what police work was really like, they made him feel like he could actually do the job. Advertisement  “That and also, I feel like there’s this negative connotation to police work, and the way people see it,” Juan added. “I just want to be the best person that I could, and help the community.”
 


In posting dozens, or hundreds, of hours of content on a regular schedule, police departments are essentially turning themselves into multimedia publishing platforms. They use Twitter to break the news, Facebook Live to give press conferences, Nextdoor to track and respond to neighborhood issues, Instagram to defuse tension with positive counterprogramming, TikTok to reach Gen Z, and long YouTube videos to provide ongoing entertainment and “education.”Nick Perez, a current police officer who started and starred in the hyper-popular Miami Police Department YouTube channel, told me that when his unit began the channel, they were seeing a lot of outrage over police violence online. Advertisement     “Back in 2015. It was a very anti-police atmosphere that was going around social media and there was no real pro-police side, nobody speaking on behalf of the police departments,” Perez said. The result, he said, was, “OK now here’s the police side, but we were doing it to reach out to our community as the Miami police department. However, we kind of took on the role of the pro-police content that was coming out.”Other police agencies caught on, he said, and suddenly, “with the idea of reaching our community, we kind of reached the world.”“The news was running stories about police whatever, what was happening with police in a negative light, but all we were doing was showing what we were doing,” Perez said later. “Which in turn made [people say], ‘let’s share their positive story.’ [There was] a lot of anti-police rhetoric, and we were the positive story coming out around that time.”Perez’s YouTube videos have also significantly boosted recruitment for the department, he told me, highlighting a recruitment video they recently posted that resulted, he said, in 1,000 new job applications in 12 hours.The massive protests that erupted after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, were the catalyst for not just Black Lives Matter but for police departments to realize they needed to embrace these new methods if they wanted to be heard, Stevens, the founder of SMILE, said.“Ferguson was a huge, huge, huge event, Charlottesville was huge, Baltimore, all of them were big in the whole social media policing [uptick]. But Ferguson was a real peak in police social media,” said Stevens. Advertisement     “The Ferguson Police Department were doing zero with social media when the whole ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’ situation went down,” Stevens said. “Now they’re very much in support of using social media and understand that they have to use social media, because they get how social media was their undoing that day.”One former police officer — who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize his new career — worked in police media outreach in a liberal city for years, but left the force in part due to the systematic problems exposed by the Black Lives Matter movement. He said that he faced a lot of debates in his department over how to use social media, particularly video platforms.“OK, so I’ve learned more about this wonderful human driving a patrol car and responding to tough calls,” he said. “But I’ve got a problem with the person who stopped me last week and was very dismissive and rude, or called my friend a racial slur, or refused to give me their name and badge number.”If there is no clear way to file a complaint about that other person or to successfully hold them accountable — which there very often is not — then showing examples of positive policing without any means of accountability is creating a false narrative, he said.“It’s a really fine line if you’re only doing one and not doing the other,” the former officer said. “Then that — that borders on propaganda.” Advertisement     Kansas City illustrates the problem. In order to file a complaint against a KCPD officer, citizens have to contact the Office of Community Complaints, “a non-police, civilian oversight agency.” However, the site makes clear, if the office deems the complaint worthy of an investigation, it hands that complaint over to the department’s Internal Affairs Unit. According to KCPD’s Office of Community Complaints, of 1,059 complaints in Kansas City between 2016 and 2019 against police officers, 246 investigations were completed, and only around 12% ruled in favor of civilians, the OCC said in a statement. The Police Scorecard, a public database tracking police accountability nationwide, found that of the 132 use-of-force complaints during that time, 0% ruled in favor of civilians. KCPD’s OCC said in a statement that “most of the force investigations either do not present enough information for the OCC to make a determination or the evidence proves conclusively that there was no violation of policy or procedure,” and added that in cases where the office does not rule in favor of the complainant, they may still take “corrective action” like training or policy reviews.The KCPD has, though, recently been held accountable in the court system. In November, an officer was found guilty of killing Cameron Lamb in his home during an erratic driving investigation. The trial was reportedly the first for a KCPD officer accused of killing someone in the line of duty since 1942.The videos also raise other questions of accountability. Robin Andersen, a professor of media studies at Fordham University who has studied media treatment of police and the military for decades, observed that the officers in these videos often deal with people with mental illnesses, sending them off to hospitals and emergency rooms instead of arresting them.Replacing police with mental health professionals has been one of the major demands of police reform activists. And since last summer’s protests, several cities around the country have attempted to oblige, rolling out pilot programs that send specialists instead of police to behavioral health calls. According to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by police, almost a quarter of the people shot and killed by police since 2015 have mental illnesses. Advertisement     The results from the first three months of New York’s version of this program were promising, and New York expanded the program in November. More people called for and received help than they do from 911 calls, New York 1 reported, and fewer people were transported to the hospital (which often does very little for a patient and leaves them with exorbitant medical debt). In June, the KCPD started requiring all of its officers to take a 16-hour “Intro to Crisis Intervention” course (though, KCPD noted, 55% of its officers have taken the full 40-hour course), and the department has one, five-person squad called the Crisis Intervention Team. It specifically responds to mental health calls but is composed of police officers. The department does not currently have plans to replace officers with civilian mental health specialists, KCPD said.“It is so clear, the reason these videos exist is to block and attempt to affect the public’s demand for police reform,” Andersen said. “They’re saying, ‘We don’t really need this. We are really nice guys already doing really good work and helping people.’ But we know that is, in reality, not the case.”In a statement responding to Andersen’s analysis, KCPD’s public information officer, Jake Becchina, disagreed. “Our department is constantly striving to be a better version of itself. We don’t always get it right, but we try to make improvements,” Becchina wrote. “We would never say that we are perfect and reform/improvements/change (however you would like to say it) are not needed. As such providing videos to try to prove that reform isn’t needed would be counterproductive to our mission.”
 


Outside of the Kansas City Police headquarters, statues memorializing fallen officers were wrapped in cellophane since the protests. All year, people protesting police brutality had been graffitiing them with “BLM” and “No Justice No Peace,” so the city covered them up. One statue, not wrapped, was a metal sculpture of a man plugging his own ears, his shoe in his mouth, and his tie around his eyes. It sat directly in front of one of the entrances to the building. The sign next to it read “Communications.”Inside, cubicles are covered in children’s drawings, bobbleheads, plants, and family photos. An indoor putting mat stretches between the desks, leading to a conference table and a whiteboard with the words “Twitter is not real life” written above plans for the team’s social media strategy.Pro-police paraphernalia faces Whitelaw’s desk from almost every direction: a pegboard sign reading “Blue Lives Matter KCPD,” the “thin blue line” flag on a large wooden police badge, a shelf designed like the American flag holding police badges in each stripe. Whitelaw’s boss, Jake Becchina, wears a ""thin blue line"" dog tag with a prayer on the back around his neck.“I don’t have any Blue Lives Matter stuff,” he said flatly when I asked him about it when we were away from the office. “It ain’t my cup of tea. And that’s all I’m gonna say about that.” Advertisement     The day after shooting the video at the academy, Whitelaw sat in his cubicle, preparing to edit the new footage and to add captions and a soundtrack. He wanted to get it out as soon as he could, so the next academy class would have even more applicants. His colleagues were sitting at the conference table, explaining to the least online among them what an influencer was. One of them called Whitelaw an influencer, and he chuckled.
 


“What if you are, though?” I asked, sitting behind him. “We’ve had a lot of discussions about how you don’t consider this job your identity. But if these videos get more popular, and you’re kind of the face of the department, how do you feel you’re going to reconcile those things?”“I’ve kind of, like, feathered the idea, if that makes any sense,” he said. “Because outside of this world, I’m just me. I wouldn’t want to, you know, confuse the two. I love the department. I love the community. But like, am I going to be running around being, like, Officer Whitelaw everywhere I go?” Advertisement     I pointed out that he said people were already starting to recognize him on the street.“You’re asking me something that I haven’t necessarily thought about,” he said. “So your question is, what does it look like when I’m out there in the world, and I’m not just a random Black dude, even not in uniform, walking around in the streets? But now I am Officer Whitelaw from YouTube. That’s how people recognize me.”He took a deep breath and thought about it more, talking through the question aloud until he came to a conclusion.“If you have to be the face of something, at least it’s being the face for the right reasons, or good reasons, things that are positive,” he said, and started chuckling again.“Because there will be a face of the department some other way, so it might as well be me.” ●

The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked a Biden administration rule that required US companies with 100 employees or more to mandate that their staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to weekly testing.But the court also narrowly upheld a vaccine mandate for healthcare workers at facilities that receive federal funding.By blocking the mandate for private companies, which would have covered more than 84 million workers, the court dealt a significant blow to the White House's efforts to curtail the pandemic at a time when hospitalizations have surged nationwide due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Advertisement     ""I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement.In an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, six members of the court granted a request from the National Federation of Independent Business to prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from enforcing the private employer rule for now.The majority of justices said the NFIB was likely to succeed in court by arguing Biden's labor secretary lacked authority to impose the mandate.They said the law that established OSHA ""empowers the Secretary to set workplace safety standards, not broad public health measures.""""Although Congress has indisputably given OSHA the power to regulate occupational dangers, it has not given that agency the power to regulate public health more broadly,"" the court said. ""Requiring the vaccination of 84 million Americans, selected simply because they work for employers with more than 100 employees, certainly falls in the latter category.""The court's three liberal members — justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan — said in a dissenting opinion that they would have allowed the mandate to be enforced, calling COVID-19 a ""menace in work settings.""They accused their colleagues on the court — ""elected by, and accountable to, no one"" — of acting inappropriately as workplace health and safety experts.""In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed,"" the liberal justices wrote. ""As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible."" Advertisement     But in a separate decision in which Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals, the court decided 5–4 that the secretary of health and human services was authorized under existing law to require facilities to ensure their staffs are vaccinated against COVID (unless exempt for religious or medical reasons) in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid funding.""After all,"" they wrote, ""ensuring that providers take steps to avoidtransmitting a dangerous virus to their patients is consistent with the fundamental principle of the medical profession: first, do no harm.""The decision will affect 10.4 million healthcare workers at some 76,000 medical facilities.Four of the court's most conservative members — justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett — said they would not have allowed that rule to go forward.Republicans cheered the court for blocking the private sector mandate, calling it an unnecessary imposition on businesses.""President Biden’s private sector vaccine mandate was always unwarranted and overbearing,"" Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi wrote on Twitter. ""I am glad that the Supreme Court has curbed runaway executive overreach and ensured that individual liberty does not become a casualty of this pandemic.""But public health workers and scientists said the decision was deeply disappointing.""As a physician and public health person I find this ruling very disappointing,"" said Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. ""So many Americans have been poisoned with vaccine misinformation. Mandates work to protect them and those around them. This ruling will mean more suffering, more deaths, and more overwhelmed hospitals."" Advertisement     In his statement, Biden credited his vaccine mandates with reducing the number of unvaccinated Americans from 90 million to under 35 million.He called on business leaders to still institute their own vaccine requirements for employees in order to protect staff and customers.""The Court has ruled that my administration cannot use the authority granted to it by Congress to require this measure,"" Biden said, ""but that does not stop me from using my voice as President to advocate for employers to do the right thing to protect Americans’ health and economy.""Like many Americans, the Supreme Court justices worked remotely and online during a long stretch of the pandemic. All nine members have since been vaccinated and received a booster shot, according to a court spokesperson.

The last seven years on Earth have been the hottest on record with no signs of slowing down, and 2021 ranked the sixth warmest ever, climate researchers at NOAA and NASA announced on Thursday.This is what climate change caused by human activity looks like, and there’s no end in sight.“We’re already seeing the impacts of the global warming that we’re talking about now in local weather and in extreme [weather events],” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, at a press conference. “We can detect the contribution of human warming on things like the heat waves in the Pacific Northwest, the intense precipitation that accompanied Hurricane Ida, or the floods in Germany and China.” Advertisement     A similar analysis from European scientists released this week also found the last seven years were the hottest on record, although their specific rankings by year differed slightly. According to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2021 was the fifth warmest on record.Last year was an especially deadly and expensive year for climate and weather disasters in the US. Texas saw unmatched freezing temperatures last winter, the Pacific Northwest experienced deadly heat waves, and the South and Midwest faced massive tornadoes, among many other extreme weather events in 2021.The researchers noted that a climate pattern known as La Niña helped to slightly cool parts of the Pacific Ocean in 2021, which may continue into this year. However, the average temperatures in the last seven years have all leaped over previous decades’ records.“It’s clear that each of the past four decades have been warmer than the one that preceded it,” Russell Vose, chief of the analysis and synthesis branch of NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, told reporters. “And it’s been a steady increase in temperature since at least the 1960s.”Climate researchers expect the years ahead to follow this pattern and predict we will reach an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 2030s or early 2040s. However, regardless of when the globe reaches that temperature, scientists point out that global warming data is no longer just data but is playing out in real life. Advertisement     The planet has already warmed more than 1 degree Celsius compared to 1880s levels. Time is quickly running out to limit warming another half degree, which is the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Frustration about the lack of action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions came to a head at November’s 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which left many climate activists and developing countries unsatisfied with minimal progress from larger countries.“Temperatures will keep rising as long as we keep increasing greenhouse gases,” Schmidt said.That means 2022 will probably be another hot one, filled with more dangerous disasters.“We can predict with some confidence that we will see more and more extreme heat waves, more intense rainfall, and more coastal flooding,” Schmidt said. “It may not be the Pacific Northwest next year, but it will be somewhere and we will obviously have to be prepared.”Just this week, South America and Australia are facing blistering heat waves. Western Australia’s Onslow today hit 123.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50.7 degrees Celsius, matching a record-high temperature for the region set back in 1962, the BBC reported. And earlier this week, Buenos Aires reached 106 degrees (or 41.1 degrees Celsius), according to AccuWeather, making it the second-highest temperature recorded there in more than a century.“There’s probably a 99% chance that 2022 will rank in the top 10 hottest years,” Vose said.

Federal prosecutors have charged Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 others associated with the armed extremist group with seditious conspiracy, the first such charge to come out of the sprawling investigation of the Capitol insurrection since it began just over a year ago.Rhodes, 56, was arrested on Thursday shortly before noon local time in Little Elm, Texas, about 35 miles north of Dallas. A second man, Edward Vallejo, 63, was arrested in Phoenix, according to the Department of Justice. The other nine defendants have all previously been charged in the Oath Keepers conspiracy case pending in Washington, DC, federal court. Advertisement     According to the indictment, which was handed up by a grand jury on Wednesday and sealed until the following day, Rhodes conspired “to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power” by stopping Congress’s certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6.He and the other defendants, prosecutors claim, “coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, DC, equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes’s call to take up arms at Rhodes’s direction.”Attorney Jonathan Moseley, who represents another member of the Oath Keepers, said he was on the phone with Rhodes when the FBI called on the other line asking the group's founder to come outside so he could be arrested. Kellye SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ general counsel, said she is working to find a criminal defense attorney to represent Rhodes. She called the arrest “all part of the show” and said he did not have enough funds to hire representation.In the immediate aftermath of the assault on the US Capitol, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, at the time, Michael Sherwin, announced that a task force had been formed to explore more serious charges in connection with Jan. 6, including seditious conspiracy. Advertisement     But although more than 725 people have since been charged with a variety of misdemeanors and felonies for their involvement in the events of Jan. 6, a number of whom are facing conspiracy charges related to obstructing Congress’s attempts to certify the Electoral College, none has previously been charged with crimes related to sedition — which amounts to inciting a rebellion against the government.The charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. It’s a rarely charged offense. Federal prosecutors last tried to pursue it in a 2010 indictment involving members of a militant group, and a judge ended up acquitting the defendants of the sedition count two years later.Rhodes, whose first name is Elmer but who goes by his middle name, founded the Oath Keepers in 2009. Known for the distinctive patch he wears to cover up an eye he lost from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound, he is a former Army paratrooper and graduate of Yale Law School who was later disbarred from practicing law. He worked briefly for former member of Congress Ron Paul and rose to prominence as a frequent guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, as well as for leading the Oath Keepers members into a series of charged political events, including the 2014 confrontation between cattle ranchers and federal law enforcement in southern Nevada known as the Bundy standoff.Rhodes, originally from Nevada, lived for years in Montana, but since separating from his wife in 2018 has lived an itinerant life. He settled most recently in Granbury, Texas, where SoRelle, the Oath Keepers’ attorney, is based. A longtime libertarian and critic of political figures on both sides of the aisle, Rhodes became more closely aligned with former president Donald Trump in the lead-up to and wake of the 2020 election, casting doubt on the results of the election and calling on members of the Oath Keepers to attend protests and gather in Washington on Jan. 6. Advertisement     The original conspiracy case filed against members of the Oath Keepers in late January 2021 has grown to nearly two dozen defendants. In the process, it has danced around Rhodes' involvement in their activities, referring to him as ""Person One"" in court filings. Nine of the 17 defendants in that case were also charged with seditious conspiracy in the new indictment.According to the 48-page, 17-count indictment, Rhodes began preparations for an apparent rebellion on Nov. 5, 2020, just two days after the presidential election, when he invited other Oath Keeper members to a leadership chat on the messaging platform Signal. “We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes wrote at the time. “Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit.”Over the following weeks and months, prosecutors allege, he employed increasingly fiery language to encourage the group's members to prepare for conflict and, ultimately, to travel to Washington. “It will be a bloody and desperate fight,” he wrote on Signal on Dec. 11. “We are going to have to fight. That can’t be avoided.”Between Dec. 30 and Jan. 2, Rhodes bought some $12,000 worth of firearms and accessories, including a shotgun, night vision goggles, and large amounts of ammunition, the indictment alleges. On Jan. 3, he departed Granbury, Texas, for Washington, stopping twice en route to spend an additional $10,500 on an AR-15 platform rifle, scopes, more ammo, and other accessories. And in the two weeks after Jan. 6, he spent an additional $17,500 on such items. Advertisement     It’s not clear where Rhodes stored such items while in Washington. The indictment details his work to help coordinate a so-called Quick Reaction Force, or QRF, composed of members of the Oath Keepers and associates from Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona who stowed their weapons in a Comfort Inn in Arlington, Virginia.One of those individuals, according to the indictment, was Vallejo, a member of the Oath Keepers chapter in Arizona and a self-described “activist” who served as an alternative delegate for the state’s Republican Party and attended the 2012 Republican National Convention. In a message sent to another member of the Oath Keepers on Jan. 4, he referred to the Comfort Inn as the “allied encampment.” Appearing on a podcast early on Jan. 6, he discussed the possibility of “guerilla war,” noting “there are people who are prepared, have the will, have the facilities to do more than taunt.”Although Rhodes is not accused of entering the Capitol, prosecutors now say he entered “restricted grounds” on Jan. 6 by standing outside the building while it was being stormed, and they detail how he directed the movements of people who ended up penetrating the complex. Amid the chaos, Rhodes reacted to incoming messages that were claiming members of antifa were pushing past the Capitol Police.“Nope. I’m right here,” Rhodes responded. “These are Patriots.”Later that night, the charging document claims, Rhodes joined several other members of the Oath Keepers celebrating the day’s events at a restaurant in Vienna, Virginia. Amid the festivities, he sent out an encrypted message: “Patriots entering their own Capitol to send a message to the traitors is NOTHING compared to what’s coming.” Advertisement     Given the encrypted nature of the Signal chats Rhodes engaged in, it’s not clear how prosecutors were able to gather their evidence. Federal agents seized Rhodes’ phone last May, and he sat for an interview with the FBI in July. In September, the government also used a search warrant to seize attorney SoRelle’s phone. That warrant identified “seditious conspiracy” as a possible crime being investigated.Meanwhile, four other alleged members of the Oath Keepers have pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, presumably sharing their phones with investigators. Although little has been heard from those people, last month, prosecutors said they were continuing to help the government.The new indictment effectively splits the Oath Keepers defendants into separate cases. The original case, which charges conspiracy to interfere with Congress’s activities but not seditious conspiracy, is slimmed down to seven defendants.Rhodes, meanwhile, faces the sedition-related charge, along with the other conspiracy count, alongside Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Joshua James, Roberto Minuta, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel, Brian Ulrich, and Thomas Caldwell. Rhodes and seven of the other defendants were also charged with obstruction for deleting electronic records in the wake of Jan. 6.Prosecutors have also secured a separate new indictment against a previous Oath Keepers defendant, Jonathan Walden, who is charged with obstructing Congress and illegally being at the Capitol, but he does not face any conspiracy allegation. Advertisement     It was not immediately clear what impact the new charges will have on the court’s schedule. Shortly before the holidays, US District Judge Amit Mehta rejected efforts by the defendants in the Oath Keepers case to get the conspiracy charges tossed out. The judge had planned to begin trial on one group of Oath Keepers in April, with a possible second trial in July. It now seems likely that the first trial date will no longer be at play.Unlike many of the charges brought against alleged Capitol rioters so far, which have focused on the physical criminal acts committed that day — such as assaulting police, disrupting Congress’s certification of the election results, and simply illegally being in the Capitol — sedition deals with a person’s intent to go against the US government.The felony offense makes it a crime to “conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States.”In a public address last week marking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack, Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled that people who hadn’t gone into the Capitol could still face prosecution for any involvement in the insurrection. “The Justice Department remains committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,” he said, “whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.”The Oath Keepers, along with the Proud Boys, have been a point of focus for the select congressional committee investigating Jan. 6. In November, the committee subpoenaed Rhodes to provide documents and a deposition, citing “credible evidence of” his involvement in the Capitol insurrection. Advertisement     According to Moseley, Rhodes was scheduled to appear before the committee on Feb. 2. The attorney represents Kelly Meggs, one of the other members of the Oath Keepers who is now indicted for seditious conspiracy, and had hoped Rhodes could be a witness for his client in the case. At the time the FBI called on Thursday, Moseley and Rhodes were discussing whether the group leader would answer the committee’s questions or invoke the Fifth Amendment, the lawyer said. It took a few minutes for Rhodes to go outside, he added, because he was not yet dressed at the time.“I am incredibly relieved,” said Tasha Adams, who filed for divorce from Rhodes in early 2018, claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive to her and their children. “I feel like I just set down a heavy weight that I have been carrying. The weight of constant fear, of always looking over my shoulder to make sure my kids are safe.”

Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

A Chicago criminal court judge was caught on camera Tuesday disparaging a high-profile civil rights attorney who had represented a client in their courtroom less than an hour earlier.“Can you imagine waking up next to her every day? Oh my god,” Cook County Circuit Court judge William B. Raines said in reference to Jennifer Bonjean, an attorney who recently convinced the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to toss out comedian Bill Cosby’s conviction. Advertisement     “There would be a number of things wrong with my life if I was waking up next to her every day,” Assistant State’s Attorney Susie Bucaro, also on the livestream, replied to the judge.None of the participants in the conversation, which included two prosecutors and a public defender, seemed to realize that their comments were being livestreamed on YouTube. Many routine court hearings in Chicago, and elsewhere across the country, are now conducted on video due to COVID-19.“Oh, wait,” Raines said. “Media streaming live on YouTube? What’s up with this?” The recording then stops.Bonjean told BuzzFeed News she was unaware of the video recording until receiving an anonymous tip several hours after the hearing. Raines recused himself from the case Wednesday after Bonjean filed an emergency motion to preserve the video. The case has since been reassigned to another judge. A video of the livesteam is no longer publicly available but BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the transcript of the comments. Advertisement     The recording, Bonjean said, “shows what some of us already know: That there's this chumminess that goes on behind closed doors and makes you wonder whether cases are being heard on the merits or for some other reason.”Bonjean appeared virtually before Raines on behalf of a Chicago man who claims police framed him for a murder he did not commit. In 2017, BuzzFeed News published an investigation showing that the man, Roosevelt Myles, had waited for 16 years for a court-ordered hearing to reevaluate his conviction.Myles, 57, served 28 years before completing his sentence in 2020. He is still awaiting a reexamination of his case that the courts had ordered four decades ago.Attorneys at Tuesday’s hearing discussed footage from an investigative television series, Reasonable Doubt, that profiled Myles’ case and determined that he was likely innocent of the 1992 murder for which he was convicted. Bonjean told Raines she had no objection to the prosecution collecting video from the television show but claimed the prosecutor, Todd Dombrowski, lied in a motion to obtain the video. Dombrowski denied the charge in front of the judge. He was not on the livestream when Raines made his derisive comments.In a court filing, Bonjean characterized Bucaro's comment as anti-gay. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Bucaro said that the comment had nothing to do with sexual orientation and was a hypothetical reference to having an extra-marital affair. Advertisement     Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who oversees the prosecutors mocking Bonjean, issued an immediate apology to the attorney.“I assure you that this behavior is unacceptable and runs counter to the values of this administration,” Foxx wrote, calling the prosecutors’ comments “unprofessional.”In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Foxx’s office reiterated her disappointment.“Their actions reflect poorly on the work of our office and the entire criminal justice system,” the statement reads, noting that Foxx had spoken directly with both prosecutors and “as a personnel matter, this will be addressed appropriately.”A spokesperson for Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans’ office said judges cannot comment on pending cases.Raines won a 2014 election for his seat on the bench after a career in private practice, as a prosecutor, and as a police officer. Voters elected to retain him in 2020. That same year the Chicago Bar Association rated him “qualified.”Bonjean said the Raines video underscores a structural problem within the Cook County criminal court system, the country’s second largest. Prosecutors and public defenders are assigned to handle cases in front of one judge. That, she said, encourages both prosecutors and public defenders to try to curry favor with the judge for the sake of their clients or careers. Bonjean said that power differential may have been a factor in the attorneys’ decisions to join Raines in criticizing her.Meanwhile, Myles, whose fate is at the heart of the case that Raines once presided over, sat silently in a collared shirt and navy blue sweater on the livestream. After learning of the judge’s comments, he expressed doubts about ever having the opportunity to clear his name.“This just shows what we’re up against,” he said.

286,The incident reportedly occurred after a fan asked Ye for an autograph.,"


Kayle Hill hasn’t left her apartment since Dec. 27. A 25-year-old disabled person, she’s taking isolation more seriously than ever before to avoid exposure to the contagious Omicron variant of COVID. She’s stopped her practice of making short visits to local spots, only goes outside to occasionally pick up curbside deliveries, and will miss a medical appointment to address pain this month.While nondisabled people may be calmed by the idea that Omicron is a less severe version of COVID, the threat of a highly transmissible version of a deadly infection is as scary as ever for people with weakened immune systems. And recent comments by top COVID leadership that flippantly passed over the very real threat COVID still poses to immunocompromised people were met with frustration from people like Hill. Advertisement     “It terrifies me to my core,” Hill said of this phase of the pandemic. “As immunocompromised people can never be sure that their body responded sufficiently to the vaccine, many of us — while so incredibly thankful for the vaccine and the layer of protection it provides — have to live as though we are in a pre-vaccine world.”Hill lives with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and degenerative disc disease in her back, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which she takes an immunosuppressant. She told BuzzFeed News it’s “absurd” that Omicron has been hailed as a “milder” version of the virus while she considers this time to be the most dangerous phase of the pandemic yet for the roughly 7 million immunocompromised people in the US.
 


The CDC has recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised people receive a fourth shot of the COVID vaccine in 2022. But the sheer rapidity of the spread of Omicron has posed a very real immediate threat for people with immunosuppressive conditions because they can get sick more easily and are more likely to develop severe illness. A healthy immune response to the vaccine is needed to create protective antibodies, and therefore vaccines are less likely to be effective in people who are immunocompromised.People who live with a disability, chronic illness, or other immunosuppressive conditions have shared their message on social media that managing their risk shouldn’t only be up to them, using the #MyDisabledLifeIsWorthy hashtag started by disability activist Imani Barbarin.They have also adopted extreme protective measures to prevent COVID exposure, such as canceling or missing medical appointments, quitting jobs, or staying at home in self-imposed lockdown.“There’s no such thing as too cautious at this point if we want to protect chronically ill or disabled people,” Hill said.When she moved to Waterbury, Connecticut, in 2020, Hill struggled to find a pain management medical team that worked with Medicaid. But then she finally got a job with private insurance, found a new doctor, got an MRI, and was suggested a pain treatment plan involving occasional injections. Advertisement     “I was thrilled,” Hill said. “I was really looking forward to it.”But as the number of COVID cases rose in Waterbury, Hill decided to cancel the Jan. 19 appointment — she couldn’t risk exposure in the small waiting room that on previous visits had been very crowded.After she canceled, Hill broke down in tears knowing that she’d have to continue living in pain despite overcoming so many other barriers to getting the healthcare she needs.
 


Hill said she has “a lot of anger” toward the government because it has few plans of action other than widespread vaccination to combat COVID. While getting a shot is effective for people who don't have a disability, she said, it’s not possible for people like her to ever feel totally sure their body responded effectively to the vaccine. The government needs to back up vaccination with other elements, such as mask mandates and limited capacity in public spaces, she said, or else people with weakened immunity must continue living in fear of potentially severe infection.“With so few other mitigation strategies in place, community spread is beyond what we’ve seen before, again leaving immunocompromised people in a particularly vulnerable situation,” Hill said. Advertisement     Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in an interview with Good Morning America that it was reassuring news that most of the people dying of Omicron were those with multiple comorbidities, or preexisting conditions.“Over 75% of deaths occurred in people with at least four comorbidities, so really these are people who are unwell to begin with,” Walensky said. “Really encouraging news in the context of Omicron.”But what sounds encouraging to a nondisabled person navigating the pandemic can actually mean an increased danger for people like Hill if it leads to the general public acting more recklessly.And exercising caution has put immunocompromised people in the balance of deciding which elements of healthcare they’re willing to put off to avoid a higher risk of exposure to COVID.“If I were to skip an infusion, my disease would become active and I’d end up hospitalized,” said Tessa Miller, a Brooklyn-based health journalist and author who is chronically ill. Miller lives with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease where the immune system attacks the digestive tract. She also has celiac disease, an immune response to gluten that can also damage the small intestine.
 


Miller receives immunosuppressant infusions every six weeks at a chemotherapy center, and even though COVID is a risk, she said she can’t skip the appointments because they keep her chronic illness in check. Miller decided to put off other medical treatments, though, including seeing a neurologist to treat migraines caused by the infusion treatment until COVID cases go down. Advertisement     “Being hospitalized right now is my worst nightmare, not just because of the risk of COVID, but because the system is entirely overwhelmed and I don’t want to add to that,” she said.People with disabilities or chronic illnesses are “tired” from the pandemic, Miller said, adding that the CDC’s COVID messaging — though it hasn’t surprised her — treats disabled people as “disposable.”“If the pandemic has revealed anything, it’s that the economy comes before all else and that we should be willing to die for it,” Miller said. “It’s not only saying ‘We didn’t consider chronically ill and disabled people when we created these guidelines,’ but ‘We also don’t care if you die.’”Miller hasn’t socialized since February 2020. She didn’t experience a return to public transit rides or long-awaited vacations as nondisabled people have postvaccination. She said her world just feels “smaller and lonelier.”If chronically ill and disabled people had been sought for guidance from the start of the pandemic, she said there would have been more stringent measures to limit the virus’s spread. She said officials would have done things like pay people to stay home or get vaccinated, make remote work a standard, provide universal childcare, and study the long-term effects of COVID to anticipate a new group of people with disabilities.“We don’t know how else to say that our lives are worth living and that we’re worth listening to,” Miller said. “Had chronically ill and disabled people been looked to for guidance and leadership from the start of the pandemic, I can guarantee we’d be in a lot better shape than we are now.” Advertisement     Nondisabled people may find solace in sharing the idea that everyone will contract Omicron at some point so it can’t be that bad. But to Rumor Noelle, this is like saying to immunocompromised people that they should be getting ready for severe illness or death.Noelle, a 26-year-old full-time student in Hampton, New Hampshire, said it’s “extremely inaccessible” to even get a COVID test if you don't have a disability. Since they are living with cerebral palsy, someone has to drive them to get a PCR test, and home tests are extremely expensive given how much they’re already paying for medication and medical bills.
 


Noelle sees about seven doctors a month, but when they saw reports that some medical professionals were testing positive, they canceled appointments for January with a pain specialist and a surgery consultation to address pain in their legs and arms. Now they’ll have to buy extra pain relievers and ice packs until they can get another appointment.“As that gets worse, I still have to worry about what happens if I get COVID,” Noelle said, adding that it’s frustrating that people with disabilities even have to use a hashtag as a reminder they deserve to live. Advertisement     The only time Noelle leaves home is to go to their job as a receptionist — a job they started in December after giving up a previous position at a crowded restaurant due to the higher risk of COVID exposure. Now they’re considering quitting again because coworkers have come to the office with COVID symptoms. But leaving a job is scary, Noelle said, because it’s difficult to find an employer that will accommodate frequent medical appointments.“Disabled people have been right about everything in this pandemic,” Noelle said. “Everyone's a little desensitized and too OK with disabled people’s deaths. … It’s like we’re sacrificing disabled people to make room for the new disabled people who are here because of long COVID and COVID in general.”Peter Morley, 52, has lived with chronic pain and illnesses for 15 years, including lupus, and is a kidney cancer survivor. The New York–based patient advocate has left home as little as possible during the pandemic and has missed or rescheduled myriad medical appointments because he said he feels “too vulnerable” to COVID in a hospital setting.
 


“I have reprioritized my health issues and appointments, something I would never do pre-COVID-19,” Morley said.He’s overdue for an endoscopy for liver disease, which can only be done by a hepatologist at a hospital. But like Hill, Morley said he feared narrow corridors and other closed spaces in the hospital with people who could potentially be unvaccinated, aren’t masked, or aren’t social distancing. Advertisement     When he gets stressed about taking care of his body, “my diseases act accordingly,” Morley said. If his mental health triggers some of his conditions, it could lead to hospitalization, so he’s working with a therapist remotely, something he said not everyone in his position can access.“And it’s not just us that it terrifies — our caregivers are just as alarmed,” Morley said. “We are children, parents, grandparents, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and we are your neighbors. We are not statistics.”

Prince Andrew's honorary military appointments and royal patronages have been removed by the Queen, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Thursday.The Palace said that Andrew, 61, stepped down from his patronages — the 66 charities of which he was the royal patron, according to the royal family's official website — ""with the Queen's approval and agreement."" Advertisement     Thursday's statement came one day after a New York federal judge declined to dismiss a civil sexual assault case against the Duke of York.""The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending the case as a private citizen,"" reads the Buckingham Palace statement released via social media.Virginia Giuffre, 38, alleges that Andrew — a longtime friend and travel companion of disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in federal prison in while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges — sexually abused her on three occasions between 2000 and 2002 while she was under the age of 18. Giuffre has accused the Duke of York in court documents and interviews of sexually assaulting her in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands despite knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim.Andrew has denied Giuffre's claims.On Aug. 9, 2021, Giuffre sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a short-term law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period. Advertisement     Although Andrew and his lawyers fought to have the case thrown out, a New York federal judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss the lawsuit, which will go to trial unless it is settled out of court.
 


Giuffre first accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a defamation case against Epstein and his former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, in December 2014. Giuffre's claims became known to the public when that document and other records from this case were unsealed in 2019.Soon after the documents came out, Andrew issued a statement saying that he did not “see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to [Epstein's] arrest and conviction."" He also admitted that he had made a mistake by maintaining the friendship after Epstein pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida and served 13 months in jail.“I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release [from prison] in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know,"" he said. ""I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,” Advertisement     The Duke of York addressed his friendship with Epstein and strongly denied Giuffre's claims in a disastrous BBC interview that aired Nov. 16, 2019, and caused such a public outcry that Andrew resigned from public duties mere days after it aired.In it, he denied ever meeting Giuffre — despite a now-infamous picture that shows the duke with his arm around the then-17-year-old's waist. He said that her story of dancing with him at a club was false, because she described him as being sweaty and he has a medical condition that prevents him from sweating. Andrew also said that on one of the nights Giuffre said he was with her, he was at a Pizza Express with his daughter Beatrice.
 


On Nov. 20, 2019, Buckingham Palace issued a statement from the Duke of York in which he said he was stepping back from public duties ""for the foreseeable future."" Advertisement     ""It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support,"" he said.He has not performed any public duties in more than two years, but until Thursday, his honorary military titles and patronages were ""in abeyance"" (i.e., suspended) and he was still nominally associated with them.

I was focused on the fact that I was a 17-year-old about to have a baby. I understand just as little about it then as I do now.” Advertisement     
 


“There was a time where my sister asked me — of her trust and will — if I would be the person who was sure that her boys got what they needed,” she said.“Once I realized that ... she’s in a conservatorship, I felt like I just didn’t want to be a part of [it] until maybe she was out of the conservatorship,” she said.“There was no me overseeing funds or something like that, and if that was, it was a misunderstanding,” she said. “Either way, I took no steps to be a part of it.”
 


“I went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship, and just end this all for our family,” she said. “If it’s gonna cause this much discord, why continue it?”She added, “If she wanted to talk to other people … I set that up. I even spoke to her legal team … previous legal team, and that did not end well in my favor.”
 


“I actually teared up watching this. I’m so so so sorry for Britney that after all they have done her family continues… gaslighting and [sponging] off of her,” another tweet said.
 


What’s more, Justin notoriously made disrespectful comments about Britney in a series of interviews over the course of their breakup. For example, he made crude remarks about their sex life while speaking with Hot 97, saying, “I did it. I'm dirty,” when asked if he’d had “oral intercourse” with her.
 


“This. This. This,” one person replied in agreement.
 


“I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed,” he noted.

As soon as we met, Tara Reid said she had brought me something. She pulled a small orange satchel from her pocket and handed it to me. “I made it myself. I picked every bead,” she said. Inside was a friendship bracelet made with turquoise, silver, and little rivets etched with words like “Beautiful” and “Believe.” She advised me to put it under moonlight to charge the crystals with good energy. Reid, like a lot of women who spent their entire adult lives living and working in Hollywood, is a little witchy, a little woo-woo, not that there’s anything wrong with that.We spoke over the course of a few days in Los Angeles, while the now-46-year-old actor was shooting a lookbook for her new sunglasses line, Cult Queen, and a handbag made in collaboration with designer Michael Kuluva. Before the shoot, she was reserved, almost sleepy, but when the photographer lifted the camera to her sightline, she popped out her leg, offered a smile, and for hours, turned on the charm that made her successful in the first place.This is the kind of behavior one might expect from an actor whose early breakout roles cemented her as an approachable bombshell and America’s Next Sweetheart. In 1998 she played Bunny Lebowski, a former porn star trophy wife who shops constantly, in the cult classic The Big Lebowski. In 1999, she was Vicky in the megahit teen comedy American Pie (and a few sequels), the quintessential girl next door who’s unsure if she really wants to have sex for the first time with her idiot boyfriend. Advertisement  But my favorite — and Reid’s — was her role in 2001’s Josie and the Pussycats. I always loved Melody, the band’s dim but sweet drummer. In the Archie Comics that inspired the film, she’s sidelined to punchlines where she isn’t even in on the joke — everyone thought Melody was an idiot, and they treated her as such, but she was actually just a perennial optimist. And Reid was the perfect vessel for such a character. “Everyone thought she was clueless, but she was actually really smart,” Reid told me.Josie and the Pussycats might have looked and smelled like a typical coming-of-age movie, but it was actually an incisive, brutal commentary on toxic media culture and how easy it is to lose yourself in the fame machine. Who better understands that cycle than Reid? “No matter what I do, even if I stopped acting tomorrow, I’m going to be famous for the rest of my life,” she said. “It wasn’t like I cared about being famous. It just all kind of happened.”At the dawn of the 2000s, Tara Reid was the quintessential It girl: a bankable, beautiful, blonde actor with sparkling blue eyes, perfect for rom-coms and gross-out comedies. But just a couple of years later, the shine had already started to wear off. There were fewer starring roles, in similar horny-slapstick movies (2002’s college comedy Van Wilder, 2003’s hijinks-heavy rom-com My Boss’s Daughter). When even those disappeared, she showed up on reality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Celebrity Big Brother.
 


Like so many Hollywood women of the era — Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — Reid’s career and reputation suffered in her early 20s when she hit the party circuit and became known for tabloid photos of her outside Hollywood clubs wearing low-rise jeans and chainmail halter tops. But there are big differences between Reid and her contemporaries: Namely, she never really found herself embroiled in any major scandal. “Yeah, I partied and had fun,” she told me. “We’d pop bottles of champagne. But who doesn’t?”There is no Tara Reid mugshot, no Tara Reid DUI, no Tara Reid prison sentence. “They all were in jail, they all did fucking sex tapes, crazy shit,” Reid said, referring to some of her peers. She said she never got in trouble on movie sets and was always on time. (The only story about her being late to a set is from 2018, when she was removed from a flight for causing a “disturbance,” making her three hours late to filming 5th Borough.) “There’s nothing like that about me,” she said. But it didn’t really matter — soon, perception became reality.If you ask Reid, her reputation as a party girl coincided with her reputation as a professional flake, two things she considers patently false. Elevated publications largely ignored her — she might’ve been on the cover of Maxim and Playboy and FHM, but that attention never really transferred to more roles or more respectability. Soon, her body was endlessly dissected by gossip magazines, with zoomed-in photos of her legs and abs picked apart by bloggers and readers alike.
 


Anyone who’s had their body criticized by a cruel audience, even an audience of just one, can empathize. But Reid hasn’t had her large-scale redemption narrative even as the media has reconsidered narratives about many young white women who were famous in the aughts. Maybe that’s because her story isn’t tragic in the extreme: She’s alive, well, and still working. Monica Lewinsky had her name splashed across every major newspaper in the world, while Spears had to fight for control of even the smallest part of her own life. In comparison, what did Reid endure, apart from the vagaries of fame? The world moved on; maybe she just didn’t suffer enough. Still, the way the media treated women like Reid serves as a kind of allegory for the sexist, targeted, and unjustified ways women have historically been treated.Reid isn’t bitter, but she’d have a right to be. In her 20s, she was primed to be the next big thing, but instead the roles dried up. She tolerated more cruelty than any one person should. Yet, having survived the worst of 2000s tabloid culture, Reid barely wants so much as an apology. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me,” she said. “I don’t want people to think I’m hung up on that.”As far as she’s concerned, she doesn’t actually require redemption, whether for her sense of self-worth or her career. The way the tabloids talked about her is old news. She hasn’t made any attempt to publicly rewrite her own narrative. She isn’t writing a memoir or trying to sit down with Oprah. She’s simply been working, now producing more than acting, and living a quieter life.But hasn’t she earned an apology? Because, for all the vitriol directed at her, when it comes down to it, Reid only did two things: publicly enjoyed her 20s and altered her body in a way people didn’t approve of. Neither would have ruined her life had the public not reacted so strongly. Her peers are getting absolution. So why can’t she get a break?
 


The current revival of early-aughts fashion — Von Dutch hats and denim skirts like the ones she used to wear to Hyde Lounge — brings back a more personal element of Reid’s troubles with the tabloids. “When I see things people wear sometimes, it reminds me of my mother,” she said. “It’s a very melancholy feeling. She was great. She was a boss.”Reid’s mother died four years ago, and her father around two years before that, but she was always close to them, even after moving from her native New Jersey to Hollywood in the late ‘90s, when she was 20. The media response to her personal life hit them the hardest. “My mom would say it wasn’t fair. She said, ‘I’m going to call these motherfuckers, tell them off,’” Reid said. “She was more angry than I was. She didn’t want to be judged by her friends, by me looking bad. If I could have fixed it, I would have, but it wasn’t up to me at the time.”If she had become famous now, Reid’s partygoing might look like run-of-the-mill celebrity carousing. But in the aughts, it made her a tabloid fixture. Every night out, every relationship, and every change to her body was examined and derided ad nauseam. She was a TMZ and Perez Hilton mainstay — TMZ called her “Franken-nipple” and a “train wreck,” and ran videos making fun of her for being denied entry to clubs, while Perez Hilton covered a clothing line she was working on in a post called “Hookers Rejoice!” It was the era of Britney Spears being photographed without underwear on and Paris Hilton’s sex tape. If gossip blogs needed someone to shit on that afternoon, famous young women were perfect targets.Celebrity bloggers were quick to post close-ups of every trail of cellulite on Reid’s body, every fold on her midsection. Page Six routinely zeroed in on photos of her chest, her stomach, her butt, criticizing every fold and crease. In 2004, she went pre–social media viral when the top of her dress slipped and exposed her breast while she was at a party hosted by P. Diddy. “Tara Reid: Holy Lopsided Boobs!” proclaimed Just Jared in 2007, about red-carpet photos of the starlet smiling placidly in a green dress. In 2008, she received negative attention for paparazzi shots of her in a bikini at the beach, which showed scars left over from a fumbled liposuction procedure. (The scars aren’t that extreme, but the response was so aggressive and swift, you would’ve thought she’d had a head transplant.) “It’s a ghastly, protruding thing, isn’t it?” Lainey Lui wrote on Lainey Gossip in 2011 about Reid’s midsection. “Like it might detach from her and start killing things. Part leather, part plastic, all gross.” Advertisement  
 


Too thin and she was accused of having anorexia, but even rumors of surgical adjustments earned sneering, as if trying to evade mockery was equally worthy of derision. And the more insulting headlines she had to tolerate, the fewer roles she felt like she was being offered. She’s still trying to sort through the consequences. “Why would that affect me so much, especially when there’s never ever been an article about me being unprofessional?”Meanwhile, she was certainly making money for a lot of other people. “When I hosted [TMZ], Harvey [Levin] came up to me and goes, ‘We wouldn’t even have TMZ if it wasn’t for you. You were always the one that was picked on. For us, it was perfect,’” she said. “It wasn’t for me.” (Levin did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloggers like Perez built their own empires on such cruelty. “I found out we had the same publicist, and I [said to the publicist], ‘You’re not protecting me. Everything I tell you, are you telling him?’” she said. “I think he’s the one that ruined my career, to be honest with you.” Advertisement  In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Perez said he didn’t think they ever shared the same publicist, and he denied ever receiving tips about Reid from former or current publicists. But he still couldn’t help himself. “I’m sorry for my past coverage of Tara Reid,” he said. “I could have covered her then-sloppiness and problematic behavior with more empathy.”There are a lot of things Reid doesn’t want to talk about, but the biggest one is speculation about cosmetic surgery. (Before the interview, her publicist asked that I not ask any specific questions about what cosmetic work she has or hasn’t had done, though she was willing to discuss the impact of the tabloid coverage of her body.)In the early aughts, she reportedly received two cosmetic procedures that drastically changed her body in ways she now says she didn’t want. Her breast implants were bigger than what she originally wanted (she said she asked for B cups but received C's instead), and body contouring left her with a midsection she once called “the most ripply, bulgy thing.” She seems protective of herself and her choices, which makes sense considering how often she’s had to defend how she looks. “It was a terrible experience and everyone kept throwing it in my face,” she said. “Like, why are you being so mean?”She figured her options were to either fade away entirely, or to try a new type of public life. While the tabloids were picking her apart, Reid turned to reality TV, the dominion of stars whose A-list status has evaporated. There was the 2005 E! docuseries Taradise, where Reid tried out local cuisine and nightlife in places like Greece, Italy, and Monaco. Reid liked making it but recognizes it probably affirmed the misconceptions about her. Advertisement  
 


“That’s where, really, I think the party girl image came,” she said. “I didn’t realize that would actually hurt me. I thought it would be fun.” There was a 2011 stint on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, alongside Irish celebrity twins Jedward and David Hasselhoff’s ex-wife, Pamela. Then, in 2016, she appeared on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars with her “boyfriend” Dean May. She was kicked off the show on the finale when it was revealed that they weren’t a real couple. (Reid declined to discuss the scandal in our interview.)In 2008, she spent two weeks at the Promises Treatment Center, and to outsiders, it seemed like Reid was there to get sober. She said that wasn’t the truth either. “I was dating a guy at the time, he was very destructive. I couldn’t get away from him,” she said. The relationship was so abusive, she said, that her team sent her to rehab to break them up. “The only way was to go to treatment. Everyone thought I had a real problem, and that was the problem.”Reid never wavers in her eye contact when she talks; there’s no insincerity in her delivery. “No one knows the real truth about all the things that happened. This doesn’t even bother me, because I know my truth, but it used to.” Reid talks low and slow, forcing you to lean in to hear her clearly. “How long can you be angry about something?”
 


People who know Reid well paint a vastly different portrait of her than the tabloids did. Twenty years after Josie and the Pussycats, Reid still considers costar Rachael Leigh Cook one of her good friends. Cook was supposed to be a bridesmaid at Reid’s wedding to Carson Daly before it was called off in 2001 — a breakup that tabloids and Daly attributed to Reid’s partying. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet,” Daly told Elle in 2012 in an article titled “I’m Living Proof That the Good Guys Win.” “I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off.” (Reid didn’t have as much to say about Daly: “We grew apart,” she told me. “We love each other, we care about each other, but I know I can’t spend my whole life with you. In some ways, that’s the hardest breakup in the world.”)“I think Tara’s someone who, as strong and as outspoken as she can be when she needs to be, she doesn’t actually like to look backwards,” Cook told me over the phone. “She’s always somebody who’s kept appropriate blinders going forward toward her own best, most positive path and trajectory.”Cook said that she didn’t hang out with the same “fast crowd” that Reid did, and maybe that insulated her from some of the criticisms her friend had to deal with. But the negative attention struck her as unfair. “I don’t know how she ended up as deeply mistreated as she was,” Cook said. “People would say, ‘Oh, she can’t be the sweet innocent person, not if we saw pictures of her coming out of a club in a crop top.’ That’s absurd.”The aughts starlets who survived cruel press vortexes have done it, in part, by seeking to change their public narrative with domesticity. Hilton is a newlywed, Spears and Lohan are both engaged, and Richie has two kids and a decadelong marriage to Joel Madden. Reid never followed suit, though she does have two dogs (Bella and Beso) and a live-in boyfriend of four years. But she didn’t pursue family life in as public a fashion as, say, Hilton, who recently starred in a reality show on Peacock about her wedding. “I think what they really wanted from me to make the next change was to get married and have kids. Now, she’s a woman,” Reid said. “They wanted to see me have a family, and because I didn’t, it was still fair game.” Advertisement  
 


Not that she hasn’t been offered opportunities to retell her story, like Hilton did in 2020’s This Is Paris (where she discussed her trauma after being abused at a boarding school) or Lohan’s 2014 OWN series (which followed her path toward sobriety and attempted career relaunch). “I’ve been offered a million times to do a memoir or a book,” she said. “The reason why I haven’t done it [is] because I’m not over yet. Why now? As Justin Timberlake would say, I don’t need you to cry me a river.”But doesn’t she want some kind of reckoning? I would, if someone had publicly called me “ghetto tits.” Her insistence that she doesn’t feels almost like a reverse defense mechanism: She’s so used to people mocking her that she doesn’t want to ask for too much. To ask for an apology is to take a risk; it’s too intimate and vulnerable a request from people who might still just call her ugly. Advertisement  
 


These days, bloggers like Lainey Gossip and Perez are offering up mea culpas, and it’s no longer socially acceptable to malign a young woman for going out. “Other stars get a little bit crazy now. Jennifer Lawrence fell down the stairs!” Reid said, referring to that Oscars moment in 2013. “She’s doing late-night talk shows, drinking a beer. If I ever did that, I’d be destroyed.” Still, Lawrence recently gave an interview about how she had to disappear from public life because people were getting sick of her and her relatable antics. The culture hasn’t changed that much — if tabloids want to drag a woman, they’ll find a way no matter what.Reid’s story is a case study for what happens when the stardom you’re poised for goes sideways. Now, her relationship with Hollywood and the public is an uneasy one — and no one knows, not even her, what it’ll look like in the future. Advertisement  In fact, a few months after I interviewed Reid, she was once again harangued after posting a photo of herself in a bikini. The comments came in swiftly, thousands of people assessing whether she might have an eating disorder and criticizing whatever she’s done to her body over the years. (Reid has repeatedly denied ever having any type of eating disorder.) “You need help,” one follower said. “Age isn’t everyone’s friend,” another said. Later that day, Reid posted another photo of herself, along with a statement. “Here is another picture from yesterday to show you I am not too skinny. I have a high metabolism. All I do is eat,” she said. “To everyone who wrote something nice and stuck up for me, I love you! And keep spreading that love, it is the only thing that will save this world.”Reid feels like her 20s still color people’s opinions. “Even to this day, there’s still kind of a thing about me,” Reid said. “Come on, guys. You can’t judge me by my high school picture. I’m 45 years old now.” The hope, maybe, is that people get bored of shitting on her. “Eventually it’s going to go away, and it is going away,” she said. “What are they gonna do? Pick on me when I’m 60? I’m a 90-year-old lady and I have a glass in my hand? Fuck off.”
 


If you’ve seen Reid in a movie in the last few years, it was likely one from the Sharknado franchise, the TV movie absurdities about tornados full of sharks. Reid isn’t divorced from how people perceive her, nor does she have highfalutin ideas about her career. When I asked which of her movies were her least favorite, she didn’t stutter: “Some of the stupid movies I do,” she said. “You know. It’s a paycheck.”Before filming the first Sharknado, Reid was living in London, trying to recover from a decade and a half of ruthless media attention. The city was the last spot on the American Pie Reunion promotional tour in 2012, and instead of going home, she stayed. Nothing was tying her to Hollywood anymore — her last big movie, My Boss’s Daughter (a critical bomb), premiered all the way back in 2003, and her seasonlong stint on Scrubs ended in 2005. “I need[ed] to refocus and find myself, my core again. And it worked, I went there and I lived my life,” she said. It was easier — the tabloids let up, and she felt like she could blend in and do whatever she wanted without constant observation.“My agent called me, like, ‘All right, Tara, you’re not working, we’re not doing anything, you need to work again. You need to come home,’” she said. “So then they gave me this craziest, stupidest script I’ve ever read in my whole entire life called Sharknado.”Reid credits it with reviving her career. “It’s the worst movie of all time. It’s so bad that it’s actually kind of good,” she said. “Let’s have a baby in the shark in outer space. It’s so out there. For Sharknado to bring me back is something I never would’ve expected.” Sharknado wasn’t a critical or commercial darling by any means. But the movie was a success all the same: When it premiered in 2013 on Syfy, it had 1.4 million viewers, on a channel with a typical viewership of less than a million. Its third screening a few weeks later got 2.1 million viewers. (Sharknado 2: The Second One, got 3.9 million viewers on a Wednesday night.) With its aggressive commitment to campy terror, Sharknado is now a cult classic that inspires midnight screenings and themed parties. Advertisement     In 2018, The Last Sharknado: It’s About Time came out, marking the end of the franchise. But the Sharknado movies exposed her to a new audience, as evidenced by a recent flight she took from a vacation in Mexico back home to LA. “The flight attendant comes up to me and he goes, ‘Oh my god, I so loved your movie.’ So of course, I automatically think [of] American Pie,” she said. “And he goes, ‘Sharknado is everything.’ I was like, Is this really happening?”
 


Her next project is the forthcoming Masha’s Mushroom, a thriller about an overworked mother who throws a party for her daughter where all the guests end up dosed with a hallucinogen. Reid plays the mother; Vivica A. Fox and Beverly D’Angelo also star. Reid is also a producer on the movie. Even though she decided to get involved in producing because roles for women her age are famously hard to find, she’s excited about it. “If someone’s not gonna give me that chance, then I was like, I gotta make it for myself,” she said. “I found a great script, great director. I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Finally, she’s on the other side of the Hollywood equation. “It was so funny this time, calling up the agents that said no to me that I’d like to make an offer to your client,” she said. “To reach out to all these different companies and me being the boss this time, it was like, the table’s turned. It was beyond satisfying.” Advertisement     It’s easy to root for Reid when she tells stories like this. She comes off as open and sweet; she ended our interview by proclaiming “I love you!” into my recorder. And while Reid told me, over and over, that she didn’t want or need a reconsideration, I still want one for her. Whether she’s saying it because it’s true or just a line for a culture that has largely scorned her, she does seem exhausted from explaining herself. She’s tried repeatedly to make it clear that she’s productive, settled, kind, and easygoing. It hasn’t worked so far. Appearing in a well-known movie franchise hasn’t proved it. Refusing to engage in criticism of her body hasn’t either. Wanting to be understood has only led to disappointment, so why not forget about it? Vindication isn’t everything. What could anyone do to make amends? Cry her a river, and then what?Reid has little time for regrets. “I wonder what else I would’ve done,” she said. “Do I take it back? No, I don’t. It’s who I am.”●

On a balmy day in March, a container ship called the One Munchen docked in Savannah, Georgia. On board was a shipment of button-down shirts made of “peached cotton,” a fuzzy fabric meant to feel as soft as the skin of the fruit. Embroidered on their pockets was the Hugo Boss logo.Now on sale for $82, the shirts feature a slim fit, an embroidered placket, and a promise: Hugo Boss had not sourced its cotton from China’s Xinjiang region, where forced labor is rampant. But these button-downs — along with dozens of other clothing shipments brought into the United States within the last year by Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, and other clothing brands — were produced by a large Chinese company called Esquel Group. And that’s a red flag.
 


Forced labor is so pervasive in China's far west region of Xinjiang — and government control over information is so absolute — that it is nearly impossible to establish if forced labor is being used in supply chains there. But here’s what is known:Esquel Group gins and spins cotton in Xinjiang.In July 2020, the US government placed trade restrictions on one of its Xinjiang subsidiaries, Changji Esquel Textile Co., citing concerns over forced labor.In January 2021, US regulators banned all Xinjiang cotton from entering the US, again citing forced labor.Since the cotton ban, a different Esquel subsidiary located in Guangdong — hundreds of miles away from Xinjiang — has continued exporting its clothes to brands in the US. But procurement records and company statements reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Esquel’s Guangdong branch works together with its Xinjiang-based cotton spinning factories. When asked repeatedly, neither Hugo Boss nor Tommy Hilfiger nor Ralph Lauren would say where the cotton in their Esquel shipments comes from.Esquel’s own public statements make clear that its Xinjiang cotton production is deeply intertwined with its worldwide clothing operation. The company describes itself as “vertically integrated,” meaning that it owns factories for each stage of the cotton supply chain: Esquel’s gins separate cotton fibers from seeds, and those fibers are later spun into yarn in Esquel’s spinning mills. Esquel’s Guangdong factories knit and weave cotton yarn to make cloth, then use this to manufacture clothing that can be exported to the rest of the world via the Hong Kong–based Esquel Enterprises. The company owns at least two cotton ginning companies in Xinjiang, where the bulk of China’s cotton is grown — but makes no public reference to owning any cotton ginning facilities outside the region.Since the US ban against all Xinjiang cotton began last January, at least 16 Esquel shipments have arrived in the US for Hugo Boss, trade records show, the latest one in mid-December. One shipment has arrived addressed to PVH, the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger, containing Tommy Hilfiger–branded goods; four for Ralph Lauren; and one for Polo, a Ralph Lauren subsidiary. Guangdong Esquel, along with other Esquel companies, is still listed as a supplier in Hugo Boss’s most recently published supplier list. PVH had included Guangdong Esquel on its supplier list, as well as Esquel subsidiaries in Vietnam and Sri Lanka, but in late December — after BuzzFeed News reached out for comment — PVH released an updated version of its list, and no Esquel subsidiaries were on it. No Esquel companies appear in Ralph Lauren’s latest list, which was published in November.Hugo Boss said in a statement that it had contacted Esquel, and the company had replied that “all our specifications and standards, including the observance of human rights and fair working conditions, have been and are being complied with.” Hugo Boss also said its own audits at Esquel production facilities revealed no evidence of the use of forced labor.PVH and Ralph Lauren did not respond to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions, Esquel said it had never used and would never use coerced or forced labor. It added that it follows all national import and export laws, and that it does not sell products banned in specific jurisdictions.Asked what regions it sources cotton from other than Xinjiang, Esquel did not give any specifics, saying only that it sources from “most of the key cotton producing countries globally.”The Esquel shipments raise questions not only about whether these brands continue to sell products that use cotton grown in Xinjiang but also about whether the US ban is truly enforceable.“Cotton is grown in Xinjiang, but then it is sold to warehouses, processors, and suppliers all over China,” said Laura Murphy, professor of human rights and contemporary slavery at Sheffield Hallam University, who has conducted research on forced labor in Xinjiang. And then it moves on as raw cotton or as yarn and fabric to the rest of the world. “Every time it moves, its provenance is increasingly obscured. There are many ways to track it, but so far most companies don’t seem invested in knowing where their raw cotton comes from.”A Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that under US law, importers must take “reasonable care” in ensuring their supply chains are free of forced labor. Asked what constitutes “reasonable care,” the spokesperson said companies are encouraged to “become familiar with applicable laws and regulations” and work with the agency to protect consumers from “harmful and counterfeit imports.”As part of its campaign targeting Muslims, the Chinese government has put in place labor programs in which Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities are made to work on farms and in factories. The US has labeled the campaign a genocide and has applied increasing pressure on the Chinese government, including a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. The US has continued to escalate trade prohibitions during that time: The US banned cotton and tomato imports from the region in January 2021, but last month Congress passed a law mandating that all goods from Xinjiang must be stopped at the border on suspicion that they are made with forced labor, placing the burden of proof on importers.The region has long been a top source of cotton for international companies. China is currently the world’s leading producer of cotton, with over 87% of that coming from Xinjiang. Research shows that forced labor in the region is not restricted to factory work — there is also evidence of forced labor in cotton picking in southern Xinjiang.The Xinjiang cotton ban has become a flashpoint in the larger diplomatic row between the US and China, with the Chinese government, along with Chinese consumers and celebrities, pressuring international clothing brands to continue sourcing in the region as a show of patriotic support.Human rights groups welcomed the ban but were skeptical it could be fully enforced. They say forced labor by Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minority groups, underpinned by government programs, is so widespread in Xinjiang that it’s nearly impossible for any companies that source there to ensure their suppliers don’t use it. The political sensitivity of the issue, combined with the government’s other repressive measures targeting minority groups, has made it even more difficult for foreign companies to audit their supply chains.The Better Cotton Initiative, an industry group that promotes sustainability by auditing its supply chains, stopped its reviews in Xinjiang altogether in October 2020, citing “an increasingly untenable operating environment.” Five firms did the same.Esquel is the world’s largest maker of woven cotton shirts, providing major brands with more than 100 million every year, earning the company more than $1.3 billion in yearly revenue. Esquel operates two cotton ginning mills in Xinjiang and three spinning mills, where cotton is spun into yarn. BuzzFeed News was able to geolocate the three spinning mills in Xinjiang and the garment factories in Guangdong, matching images of these facilities on Esquel’s website with satellite imagery and street-level imagery from Baidu Total View and confirming their locations. The book Esquel produced to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary describes how its spinning mill in Xinjiang’s Turpan prefecture was established specifically to supply the Guangdong factories. By 2018, the book adds, Esquel’s investment in Xinjiang amounted to $100 million, including charitable donations. The company did not answer a question about whether that supply route has changed.
 


Esquel has said publicly that it uses long-staple cotton, which is prized in the industry for its durability and luxe feel. About a fifth of the world’s long-staple cotton is produced in Xinjiang’s Aksu prefecture, and according to the company’s website, Esquel has two subsidiaries based in Aksu: Akesu Esquel Agricultural Development Company Ltd. and Akesu Esquel Cotton Industrial Company Ltd. Esquel’s own literature describes Awati County in Aksu as the “Home of China’s ELS Cotton,” referring to extra-long-staple cotton, and said it became “a major plantation site of Esquel’s quality cotton” starting in 2002. In addition to China, the company has cloth and garment production facilities in Vietnam and Sri Lanka.Hugo Boss is a member of the Better Cotton Initiative and says that 86% of its purchased cotton is “sustainable,” citing environmental standards as well as “socio-economic factors.”
 


In July 2020, following a report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Uyghur forced labor, the US announced sanctions against 11 Chinese companies including Changji Esquel Textile, one of the five Esquel subsidiaries based in Xinjiang. The sanctions announcement described these companies as being “implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.” These sanctions made it difficult, but not impossible, for US brands to trade with the companies outright — but the reputational damage meant that brands were reluctant to be seen working with them.Nike, which the ASPI report had named as working with Changji Esquel, issued a statement denying any relationship to the company. Hugo Boss said that it was asking all of its suppliers whether they were using any products made in Xinjiang. (Esquel launched an appeal, saying that the company “does not use forced labor” and “never will use forced labor.” But in October, a federal judge refused to lift trade curbs on the company.)The January 2021 ban on all Xinjiang cotton added a further layer of restriction and put major clothing brands under a fresh spotlight. Hugo Boss posted conflicting promises about what it would do next.In Chinese, on the company’s official Weibo account, Hugo Boss said, “we will continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton … For many years, we have respected the one-China principle, resolutely defending national sovereign and territorial integrity.” Around the same time, the company said in an English-language statement that it had “not procured any goods in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers.” Advertisement  Hugo Boss later walked the Chinese language statement back, saying it had not been authorized. That led Chinese celebrities to cancel deals with the brand as part of a pressure campaign to keep it from backing down.With the Xinjiang bans in force, Esquel continued to export clothes through its other subsidiaries based in Guangdong province and Hong Kong. Trade records on the Panjiva platform, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, show 36 Esquel Enterprises shipments have arrived at US ports since the introduction of sanctions, including Seattle; Savannah, Georgia; Newark, New Jersey; New York; Los Angeles; Long Beach, California; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; and Boston. According to the trade records, their combined value was $1,473,490. Hugo Boss’s most recent shipment arrived at the Port of Seattle on Dec. 18, bound for Hugo Boss Canada.Sixteen of those shipments went to Hugo Boss. BuzzFeed News was able to identify 30 different clothing products from these shipments — including white button-down blouses branded as “organic cotton poplin.” BuzzFeed News then found these items being sold under the Hugo Boss brand both by the brand’s own website and by other retailers, including ModeSens and Amazon. ModeSens did not respond to a request for comment, and Amazon declined to comment.
 


BuzzFeed News matched items of clothing sold online with those described in shipping records using the eight-digit numerical “style codes” associated with them, which also appear on the websites where they are being sold. Hugo Boss also named three Esquel factories in Guangdong in its most recently published supplier list in May 2021.
 


A document seen by BuzzFeed News shows how Esquel’s Xinjiang branch works with its Guangdong operation. At the start of August, Xinjiang Esquel issued a joint tender with the Guangdong branch, requesting bids for the transport of cotton materials. The winner of the bid would go under contract with the two Esquel branches between Aug. 1, 2021, and Jan. 31 of this year, according to the document. The companies sought suppliers that had recently gone through qualification inspections that year.On Dec. 2, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights launched a criminal complaint in the Netherlands against Dutch apparel brands that source from Esquel companies among other Chinese suppliers with Xinjiang ties. The group argues that Esquel’s “vertically integrated” structure all but ensures that the cotton it gins in Xinjiang ends up with its other subsidiaries that export clothes to Western countries. “It is unacceptable that European governments criticize China for human rights violations while these companies possibly profit from the exploitation of the Uyghur population,” said Corina Ajder, a legal adviser at ECCHR. “It is high time that responsible corporate officers are investigated and — if necessary — held to account.” The group filed a similar complaint in France in April and in Germany in September. The German filing named Hugo Boss, along with other German-registered companies. Hugo Boss has said it rejects the claims made by ECCHR. Advertisement  Tommy Hilfiger’s owner, the American apparel giant PVH, also owns brands including Calvin Klein. PVH told the New York Times in July 2020 that it would end its relationships with fabric producers in Xinjiang, as well as cotton suppliers from the region, within a year.An examination of trade records shows that the Chinese Esquel factories exported at least 12 different styles of Tommy Hilfiger–branded clothing to the United States in February. Several of these items are still on sale on the brand’s website, albeit currently sold out.Matching the products’ style codes to Tommy Hilfiger products sold on its website shows they range from sweaters and pullovers to knit skirts and dresses. One cream-colored crewneck sweater, which bears the brand’s logo, is advertised as being made with “organic cotton,” as were other products. The clothing sells for between $68 and $150.●

The police officers who investigated a domestic dispute between Gabby Petito and her fiancé shortly before her death made several mistakes and should be placed on probation, according to an independent review released Wednesday.The report found that the two Moab police officers who contacted Petito and Brian Laundrie on Aug. 12, 2021, after being alerted to a ""domestic problem"" failed to cite Petito for domestic violence, misinterpreted Utah's assault code, did not take photographs of her injuries, and neglected to contact the 911 caller who reported seeing Laundrie slap Petito, among other issues. The mistakes they made, however, were not intentional, and it's impossible to say what impact they may have had on her death, concluded Price City, Utah, police Capt. Brandon Ratcliffe, who conducted the review. Advertisement     ""The officers did not know what they were doing was wrong at the time and did not make the decision to benefit themselves in any way,"" Ratcliffe wrote. ""They both believed at the time they were making the right decision based on the totality of the circumstances that were presented.""In addition to placing the officers on probation, Ratcliffe recommended that Eric Pratt and Daniel Robbins receive additional training on report writing and investigating domestic violence, as well as overall reviews of how the Moab Police Department approves reports and its requirements on gathering photographic evidence of injuries sustained by and offering medical assistance to all individuals involved in an incident. He also advised that Moab police follow up with the 911 caller that the officers failed to interview, despite the time that has passed since their report.In a statement, the city said it planned to implement the recommendations.""As the Moab City Police Department continues its daily mission to serve our community, efforts are underway to provide additional resources and tools to assist the[m] in addressing domestic violence incidents,"" the statement read. Advertisement     The disappearance and death of Petito, the 22-year-old aspiring social media influencer who went missing while documenting her #VanLife cross-country road trip with Laundrie on Instagram and YouTube, captivated the internet last year. After a coroner determined the cause of her death was strangulation, domestic violence survivors and advocates raised concerns about what they believed should have tipped off Moab police that Petito's life was in danger.""If this case was handled flawlessly, would it have changed anything?"" Ratcliffe wrote in his report. ""Nobody knows.""
 


In his report, Ratcliffe concluded that Petito was likely ""a long-term victim of domestic violence,"" but he suggested that officers could not have known that from the information they had at the time.He described the ways in which Laundrie tried to control Petito's movements and said that the act of grabbing Petito's face — which survivors told BuzzFeed News was a red flag for potential future strangulation — was probably ""his attempt to 'make' Gabby calm down or 'make' her shut up.""""Although the act of grabbing someone’s face, like in this case, rarely causes any significant injury, I find that the specific act of grabbing someone’s face is extremely personal, violent, and controlling,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Just because there may have been some signs that Brian was the long-term predominant aggressor, law enforcement could only act on the information they were provided."" Advertisement     Based on his review of the body-worn camera footage, incident reports, and interviews with Pratt, Robbins, and Assistant Moab Police Chief Braydon Palmer, Ratcliffe said Petito was determined to be ""the predominant aggressor"" in this incident. Petito told the officers that she and Laundrie had been arguing all morning; when she saw the sirens as police tried to pull them over, she hit Laundrie to get his attention, causing the car to swerve.Ratcliffe explained that her statements along with what Laundrie and another witness told police ""would lead the officers to believe that Brian was acting in self-defense."" However, he noted that officers failed to further investigate the complaint Petito made about Laundrie grabbing her face, causing a scratch on her cheek.The officers in this incident had probable cause to arrest Petito, according to the report. But they misinterpreted the state's statute on assault as requiring intent when that was not necessary. They also miscategorized the incident as ""disorderly conduct"" when it should have been recorded as a domestic violence incident, Ratcliffe said.""Despite knowing the history of those involved, we have had to make a decision based on the information presented to law enforcement at the time, despite our personal feelings and the known history of the relationship,"" he wrote.While it's clear the officers made several mistakes in their interactions with Petito and Laundrie, Ratcliffe concluded that it was unclear whether any of their missteps ultimately contributed to her death. Advertisement     ""Would Gabby be alive today if this case was handled differently? That is an impossible question to answer despite it being the answer many people want to know,"" he wrote. ""Nobody knows and nobody will ever know the answer to that question.""

293,“This is the SAG Awards honoring [Jonathan Larson] and his life and what he stood for.”,"


Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense. Advertisement     “The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

294,"Petito was likely “a long-term victim of domestic violence,” the report acknowledged.","


The paradox of Omicron, now responsible for an estimated 98.3% of all US coronavirus cases, is that while it seems more likely to result in significantly milder outcomes than Delta and previous variants, the health system is as stressed as it’s ever been.Public health officials are warning that Omicron is threatening to overwhelm the medical infrastructure with sheer numbers, and hospitals are filled with seriously ill patients.“It's going to get worse before it gets better,” said Dean Blumberg, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the University of California, Davis.Here’s what we know about why this is happening:Omicron is more contagiousThe variant appears to be roughly two to five times more transmissible than Delta, which previously dominated US cases.“This is the second-most contagious disease in the world now, second to measles,” said Sara Murray, the director of the health informatics data science and innovation team and an associate professor of clinical and hospital medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Advertisement     “While we are seeing early evidence that Omicron is less severe than Delta and that those infected are less likely to require hospitalization, it's important to note that Omicron continues to be much more transmissible,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday.This means that even though a smaller percentage of patients infected with Omicron require hospitalization, the total number of COVID cases is so high that hospitals are seeing more of those patients than at any point in the pandemic.COVID-19 cases have reached record levels in the US, averaging around 1.4 million new reported cases a day, itself an undercount. Daily, an average of 19,800 people nationwide are now admitted to hospitals with COVID, according to the CDC, a 33% increase over the past week. Almost a third of intensive care unit beds nationwide are now filled with COVID patients, meaning roughly 1 out of every 2.5 people in an ICU ward in the country has the virus
 


More patients are being admitted “with” COVIDCOVID is so widespread right now that a significant percentage of hospitalized patients are admitted for something else but then test positive upon screening at admittance. Advertisement     “We test a lot of asymptomatic patients in preparation for procedures or surgeries, planned hospitalizations — and even in those folks who are totally asymptomatic, we're seeing a case positivity right now of about 12%,” Murray said.“It’s a very different landscape that we're seeing with overcrowding in the hospital than we've seen with the prior waves of COVID,” said Richelle Charles, an infectious disease expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “Almost half of these cases are in the hospital for non-COVID-related illnesses.”At UCSF, Murray said overall about two-thirds of their COVID patients were hospitalized for the disease, while one-third were hospitalized with it. In pediatric COVID patients, about half of them were admitted for something other than the disease.Yet even if these patients' COVID symptoms are mild or nonexistent, their positive status places an extra burden on the hospital because they require isolation and extra safety protocols for hospital staff.Staffing shortages from exposure and burnoutHidden in the increasing case numbers are doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel infected by the more contagious variant, which causes more breakthrough infections among the vaccinated than past ones, said Akin Demehin, the policy director at the American Hospital Association. Even with mild infections, those healthcare workers are still out of action for a week after their tests turn negative, per CDC policy, just as the surge fills up hospitals and drives up demand for staff.The Omicron surge will only put more stress on doctors and nurses, who still have to care for all those extra patients. One survey last August reported that nearly 60% of doctors feel burned out, Demehin said, and that was two surges ago. “We hear this from hospital leaders all the time — their number one, two, and three priority right now is workforce,” he said. “They know just how much has been asked of healthcare providers over the past almost two years.” Advertisement     More young children“This time around, we're seeing more children less than 5 years of age,” Blumberg said.He has observed that many of them have milder cases of bronchitis or croup, whereas the teens with COVID seen in earlier surges had more severe pneumonia. Most of these young children recover well, but he cautioned that with any infection and any hospital admission, “some children aren't going to do well.”Hospitalizations among young children are currently higher than they’ve ever been during the pandemic, according to the CDC.Vaccines still work, but boosters are importantOne thing the Omicron surge hasn’t altered is the well-established reality that vaccines significantly improve people's odds of not dying from COVID-19. Deaths are still on the increase, averaging 1,600 a day in the US, an increase of 40% from the past week, according to the CDC. (Walensky said at the White House briefing that she thinks most of those are Delta variant cases.)With Omicron rampant, “virtually everybody is going to wind up getting exposed and likely get infected,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday. “But if you're vaccinated, and if you're boosted, the chances of you getting sick are very, very low.”“At my hospital, we have a graphic that's sent out every day that has little people icons, those in the ICU, those on a ventilator, and those admitted for COVID. And the vast majority, overwhelmingly, are unvaccinated people in all three categories,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, who spoke Tuesday at an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing on Omicron for reporters. Advertisement     “What we've learned with Omicron is that the booster really makes a big difference in terms of reducing your risk,” Murray said. Her hospital is seeing both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized for COVID. But even patients who only had an initial series of vaccines — no booster — appear to be protected from the most severe outcomes.“What we aren't seeing is patients ending up on ventilators if they're fully vaccinated,” she said. “I don't have a single fully vaccinated patient in the hospital on a ventilator right now.”

295,Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break.,"


In Chicago, patients are being treated in hospital hallways and in office chairs.In Farmington, New Mexico, military reinforcements have been deployed in civilian hospitals from over 700 miles away in San Diego.And in Paterson, New Jersey, nonemergency surgeries have been canceled. A gallbladder condition that might typically require removal? Try antibiotics first. A bone fracture for which you might normally go under the knife? Let’s put you in a cast and crutches for a bit to see how you fare. Advertisement     “You don’t really have to invoke crisis standards of care to be delivering crisis standards of care,” said Anand Swaminathan, assistant professor of emergency medicine at Paterson’s St. Joseph's University Medical Center. “It’s an enormous challenge to render care to as many patients as we can right now.”This is America in the Omicron wave. US hospitals and their staff are currently being tested in new and challenging ways that are unlike previous surges in the pandemic, medical workers across the country told BuzzFeed News. Patients who might normally be admitted for observation are being sent home to keep beds available. Others are waiting 10 hours or more in emergency rooms to be seen, before perhaps giving up and walking out altogether.Reaching the breaking point is a deceptively slow process, but little by little Swaminathan said his hospital and others are losing the things they need to keep running effectively. “This collapse is not going to be like an armageddon. It’s not going to happen all at once,” he said. “It’s going to be fairly silent, and people aren’t going to realize it until they call 911 and no one comes.”As Omicron spreads, COVID cases are surging at record levels in all 50 states. But given the relative mildness of the variant for most people, especially the vaccinated, Anthony Fauci and others have said it is now more relevant to pay closer attention to hospitalization data than total case numbers. Yet, that too is alarming. More than 147,000 people are currently in US hospitals with COVID — more than at any point in the pandemic to date. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that the seven-day average of hospital admissions had risen 33% over the prior week to about 19,800 per day.
 


Importantly, those figures include people with an incidental case of COVID, meaning they came to be treated for something else and were found to also be positive for the virus. But while that may sound less worrying, it can be deceiving. COVID may be exacerbating some people’s underlying health issues and, crucially, the net effect on hospitals is the same: more patients taking up more beds and requiring special isolation and safety protocols so as not to infect others.While new studies are showing Omicron is less severe and requires hospital stays about 70% shorter than Delta on average, the incredibly transmissible variant is still spreading like wildfire, including among children, who are being admitted to hospitals with COVID at record rates. “The risk of hospitalization remains low, especially among people who are up to date on their COVID vaccines,” Walensky said Wednesday. “However, the staggering rise in cases — over 1 million new cases each day — has led to a high number of total hospitalizations.”All this while more and more medical workers are themselves testing positive and being forced to the sidelines, leaving their colleagues — at least, those who haven’t left the profession altogether due to burnout — straining to treat the patients turning up in droves in their emergency rooms with COVID, yes, but also for any other medical condition or traumatic injury.The cruel irony, then, is that what appears to be the mildest widespread variant of the coronavirus is the one that risks toppling the US hospital system. Advertisement     “Before this if you had an acute life- or limb-threatening medical issue and you went to an emergency department in America, you would have a promise that it would be quickly taken care of,” said Gabe Gao, an ER physician at St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts. “I don’t think we can keep that promise right now.”
 


Not every hospital is currently facing a crunch. Some that previously experienced huge waves are holding steady — for now. “In the first wave, I had 400 patients with COVID, now we have 100,” said Aaron Glatt, chair of the department of medicine at Mount Sinai South Nassau on Long Island, New York. “We have better treatments, we have a better understanding of the virus, but at the same time, two months ago I had 10 patients with COVID.”Michael Daignault, an ER doctor at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California, said he was so shaken by the surge of cases in his area last winter that he felt the current moment was more manageable. Before patients might stay for weeks or months at a time in the ICU, but now that tends to be different. “The majority of patients that are getting admitted have less severe illness. The average length of stay has gone down,” he said. “It’s a quicker turnover. We’re able to handle it.” Advertisement     But both Daignault and Glatt said they had still experienced staffing shortages, with hospital workers out sick from the virus. They also noted they live in states with relatively high vaccination rates. New York, for example, has almost 20% more people fully vaccinated than in Missouri, where total hospitalizations are now above their worst previous levels.“Missouri’s hospitals are slammed,” Missouri Hospital Association spokesperson Dave Dillon said. “Hospitals are delaying non-emergent care, boarding patients of all kinds in emergency departments for a lack of bed space, and experiencing significant workforce challenges.”“Not sure what else to tell you. These are very difficult times,” he said.In Idaho, the state with the lowest vaccination rate where less than half the population is fully vaccinated, the Omicron surge could be disastrous. Many hospitals there have only recently pulled themselves out of crisis standards of care following an overwhelming surge of Delta cases in September. Susie Keller, the CEO of the Idaho Medical Association, said her members have barely caught their breath from that trauma and are now staring down the likely prospect of another wave. “They just feel completely besieged,” she said. “It’s another thing on top of everything else.”Keller implored those in her state who have not received a vaccine to do so, lest they take up a hospital bed that could go to another person who has had their shots and comes to be treated for COVID or something else, only to discover medical assistance is in short supply. “It’s absolutely unfair, and it’s a very sad situation,” she said. “My heart truly goes out to those folks who are trying to do the right thing and for circumstances beyond their control end up in a hospital where the resources aren’t there.” Advertisement     
 


There are signs that some places hit early by Omicron have seen the worst of their spike in infections, although hospitalizations have previously tended to lag case counts by about two weeks.But other states are still yet to reach their Omicron peak, including Arizona, where in a press briefing on Tuesday, Marjorie Bessel, the chief clinical officer at the Phoenix-headquartered Banner Health, which employs over 50,000 people across the American West, pleaded with people to be patient with staff in the days and weeks ahead. More employees are calling out sick, she said, meaning patients are experiencing longer waits than normal.“We are busy in our clinics, we are busy in our urgent cares, we're busy in our emergency departments, and we are busy in our hospitals,” Bessel said. “We also understand that we are not yet at the peak of the Omicron variant.” Advertisement     In an effort to reduce the total number of medical staffers out sick at any one point, the CDC announced just before Christmas that asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days, instead of 10, if they test negative. Medical staff who have received their booster shots also now no longer need to self-quarantine at home following high-risk exposures.One ER physician in Manhattan, who asked not to be named in order to speak freely about conditions at his hospital, said that this change in CDC policy had lessened nursing shortages at his facility, but he noted doctors were still often performing nursing tasks, such as administering IVs or discharging patients.“There are obviously concerns,” he added. “I think there’s still not great evidence about how long you’re contagious, and I think it’s a rule made out of understandable necessity because otherwise we wouldn’t have enough medical workers, but on an individual level it’s hard to reckon with the idea of coming back and potentially infecting other staff members.”Across the city in Brooklyn, another ER doctor not authorized to speak with the media said she too was having to take on more tasks usually carried out by nurses or patient care technicians, in addition to her own work. She’s only been a working doctor for a year and a half, but the staffing crunch has her feeling more overwhelmed than ever. “Sometimes it’s just so busy you don’t even have time to think or have emotions about what’s going on,” she said, “but after your shift ends, then it kind of hits you, this wave of exhaustion.”Gao, the Massachusetts doctor, said he’s noticed classic symptoms of burnout in himself and other colleagues. When he walks into work on a Monday morning and sees 35 or 40 admitted patients taking up beds in the emergency department and another 20 to 30 in the waiting room, he knows he’s in for yet another rough week. It takes a certain mental and physical resiliency to choose to work in the ER, but he worries he’s already been broken by it. Advertisement     “It’s terrible. It’s awful. It’s the moral injury of all this,” Gao said. “Healthcare should not function on the backs of beleaguered emergency workers that are trying to find the smallest nook and cranny to fit someone into, and that person’s healthcare should not be hanging by a thread as a result of those efforts.”Peter Aldhous and Dan Vergano contributed reporting to this story.

296,Omicron appears to be the mildest widespread COVID variant so far. Here's why it risks pushing the US hospital system to the brink.,"


The fire in a Bronx apartment building on Sunday was one of the city's deadliest in decades, leaving 17 people dead from smoke inhalation and devastating a close-knit community.As their identities were made public this week, so were their stories. Eight children were among those killed, and some families had multiple loved ones die. Officials said the victims were largely Gambian immigrants, some of whom worshipped at the same mosques and even emigrated from the same town. Advertisement     The two youngest victims were Ousmane Konteh, a 2-year-old boy, and Haouwa Mahamadou, a 5-year-old girl. Her brother, 12-year-old Seydou Toure, also perished. He had attended eighth grade next door at Angelo Patri Middle School, the New York Times reported. His classmates have been mourning the loss together, writing messages on a memorial poster, lighting prayer candles, and wearing badges with Seydou's photo.“I loved him dearly,” said the school's principal, Angel Ortega. “He always had that smile.""Two other siblings remained in critical condition, with organizers also setting up a GoFundMe for their recovery effort.Five of the victims were from the same family. They were Haja Dukureh, 37, her husband, Haji Dukuray, 49, and their three children, Mustapha, 12, Mariam, 11, and Fatoumata, 5, the woman's uncle told the New York Post. Advertisement     The uncle, whose name is also Haji Dukuray, said he had many relatives living in the building and would regularly drive there from his home in Delaware to visit. “We have faith, so we’re holding onto our faith,” Dukuray said. “We are hanging in there as much as we can. We’re supporting each other.”The couple emigrated from Gambia over a decade ago, and all three children were born in the US, another relative, 21-year-old Hawa Dukuray, told the New York Times. The mother worked as a home health aide, and the father at a fried chicken restaurant, saving money they hoped to send back to Gambia. Living high up on the 19th floor — and without an outdoor fire escape — the family tried taking the stairs to escape the burning building, but did not make it out in time, the relative said.The family, like many of the others whose loved ones died in the fire, has a GoFundMe page set up by a relative to help cover funerals and other costs.Another family lost four loved ones in the fire: Fatoumata Drammeh, 50, Foutmala Drammeh, 21, Nyumaaisha Drammeh, 19, and Muhammed Drammeh, 12.Ishak Drammeh, 57, was not home at the time of the fire that killed his wife and children. Foutmala had been studying international economics and was about to graduate college, he told the New York Times.“She was a very good girl,” he said. “Muhammad was a good boy too. Nyumaaisha was a good girl, she finished her high school; next month she is supposed to start her college.” Advertisement     Just one day before the fire, Muhammed had celebrated his 12th birthday at an indoor trampoline park. The last time Fatima, the surviving sister, saw her mother and one of her young sisters was in their apartment before her brother's party, she said.“I just said bye to them, because we were leaving the house,” she said. “I didn’t think it would be my last time seeing them.”Just one member of the family, 16-year-old Yagub, made it out of the fire alive. He ""was the only one rescued from the building and is currently being cared for in the hospital,"" according to a GoFundMe for the family set up by their cousin Nhuma Darame.
 


The Gambian Youth Organization (GYO), a Bronx-based nonprofit supporting young members of the community, has already more than quintupled their fundraising goal, raising more than $1 million on GoFundMe to aid the victims' families.One of the organization's volunteers, Sera Janneh, 27, also died in the fire. Despite working multiple jobs, she was highly involved in GYO, its founder Momodou Sawaneh told Gothamist, describing her as an “industrial woman"" who had ""such a great life in front of her."" Advertisement     “When I talk about her, tears come out from my eyes,” Sawaneh said. ""We lost her for something that could have been prevented.""Janneh had been studying to become a social worker at Lehman College because she believed “we needed more of that in our community, especially in the African community,” her sister Mareama Janneh, 31, told the New York Times. Her younger sister ""is currently intubated with hopes of recovering from her injuries,"" she wrote on the family's GoFundMe.Sera's best friend, Breanna Elleston, 27, said they had loved visiting museums and attending concerts together since they first met in high school.“Every milestone that I’ve ever had in my life, she’s always been there for me,” Elleston said. “Even if it was hard, she would drop everything and be there for me.”Not all the victims were residents of the building; Fatoumata Tunkara, 43, and her 6-year-old son, Omar Jambang, had been there to visit a friend. Tunkara leaves behind four children, according to a GoFundMe set up by a relative.Tunkara's eldest son, Abdullaie Chan, 19, told the New York Daily News he called his mother ""more than 40 times"" when he heard about the fire.“I knew she was in that building, but I thought she got out in time,” Chan said. “She didn’t pick up the phone... I feel like she was not supposed to be there.”Also among the deceased were Isatou Jabbie, 31, and Hagi Jawara, 47. They were the parents of four children, according to two GoFundMe pages.Hagi Jawara was from Sierra Leone and came to the US as a refugee in the 1990s, his brother, Yusupha Jawara, told the Associated Press. It was there that he met Isatou Jabbine, a Gambian woman living in the Bronx, who he later married. Advertisement     When Yusupha, who lives nearby, heard about the fire, he hurried there to help bring victims to the hospital. As the hours went by without the couple answering their phones, Yusupha grew increasingly worried. He later realized a man he'd seen on a gurney had been his brother.“I was just helping the EMS transport one person to the hospital when I saw him — somebody similar like him — on a stretcher being brought to the ER,” he said. “At that time, I didn’t have the focus to know that it was him.”

Mike Kamber has had many, many lives. The founder and executive director of the Bronx Documentary Center worked as a documentary photographer for over two decades, and his work has twice been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. He lived in the Bronx for a period in the 1980s and dreamed of making an educational space that would bring arts and education to the South Bronx. Founded in 2011, the Bronx Documentary Center is a nonprofit organization and mecca for photography lovers.We asked Kamber about the photographers and images that have influenced him over his lengthy career. One of the photographs that influenced him was taken by his friend Tim Hetherington, who died in Libya in 2011 and with whom he’d discussed starting a photo nonprofit. Kamber’s mother, also a photographer who lives in Maine, was one of his early inspirations.Here are just a few of the photographers and works that inspire Kamber.
 


I was born in 1963, and my first memories photographically are images from Vietnam. Larry Burrows was easily the greatest color photographer of that generation, and his photos were the ones that affected me first — I saw them in Life magazine. And Burrows’ photos of war are not heroic — no war photo should ever be heroic. Yet Burrows’ photo here of a wounded soldier reaching out to help another wounded soldier lying on the ground is biblical in scope and brilliant in composition. It gives you a sense of the quagmire that was the Vietnam War.Burrows was shooting Kodachrome with a Leica M4: no light meter, extremely difficult to get the light right, and no room for error. And yet Burrows’ use of light and color reminds me of Goya's paintings of war from hundreds of years earlier. To me, this is just an epic, sad, and futile photo of war — but also says something about brotherhood and sacrifice. Larry Burrows was killed alongside Henri Huet, another of my favorite photographers, when their helicopter was shot down in 1971. Advertisement  
 


My mother, Hannah Kamber, took this picture in 1969 at Pineland, a notorious facility for the developmentally disabled up in Maine, the state where I grew up. She worked briefly as a photographer for the Maine Times shooting in the 1960s and covering important social issues — or at least issues that were important to her. The Maine Times was an alternative newspaper — they were sprouting up across the country then and usually focused on investigations and providing a counterpoint to the mainstream press. And the Maine Times gave my mother freedom to go out and do what she wanted. She talked her way into Pineland somehow. As she told it, there was someone on the inside who wanted to see real change. And she photographed people chained to the floor in pools of urine, filthy and forgotten. The state of Maine started an investigation based on her photos and changed the laws regarding the treatment of our special needs population. This photo showed me that photojournalism could make a real difference in people’s lives.
 


This photo by Danny Lyon was from his Bikeriders series. Danny's photos were important to me because when he immersed himself, he went all the way. His photos from the civil rights movement were from the inside, not the outside. When he did his prison book, Conversations with the Dead, he spent months inside the prison, in the subblocks, and actually printed copies of the book clandestinely in the prison workshop. In this photo, he was in deep with the Chicago outlaws as a member of the motorcycle gang, and his photos show an intimacy that no visiting photographer can touch. Danny is also a master of composition and movement and light and knows when to leave space around a photograph. But I've learned a lot, looking at his photos. Him and Robert Frank. Of course, from Danny, I learned that you had to commit all the way, that you couldn't come in and do a toe touch for an hour or a day and then escape back to your comfortable life. If you're committed, you went all the way.
 


This photo is by my friend Tim Hetherington, who was killed in 2011, and his death pushed me to start the Bronx Documentary Center, which he really helped plan out. We talked about a nonprofit like this for a couple of years. And when Tim was killed in the civil war in Libya, a group of friends came together and helped me get the BDC going.I guess you could call him a war photographer, but he was never interested in pictures of people shooting guns, and in that way he was like Larry Burrows and Henri Huet. He was always looking for something that showed how the wars were fought on the backs of civilians. Tim studied the classics and knew the Homeric wars, chapter and verse. He saw conflict as a modern tragedy, a sort of farce, that leaders played out, destroying the lives of men, women, and children along the way. I always loved this photo because it showed what war had done to the Liberian economy. It was once one of the fastest growing in West Africa. And by the time Tim and I got there in 2003, the country was in complete shambles. There'd been no electricity or running water for years, but we were lucky enough to finally come to the country.
 


I took this photo on an early morning raid in Balad, Iraq, in 2003, as the Iraq War was just ramping up. The New York Times had sent me in. In September, we all thought combat operations were over — little did we know, I was just getting started, went out with some soldiers from the Fourth Infantry Division. They were getting ambushed daily and starting to lose soldiers. They responded with early morning raids, smashing down doors, dragging men out of bed so they [could] search for weapons, and I saw these girls getting ready to go off to school as a Bradley fighting vehicle rumbled by, waited, and grabbed the photo. It's a photo that has always struck people. I think it's simply the juxtaposition. It might be a bit cliched, but it's real. We're fighting this war in people's front yards. And that's why hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are dead as a result.
 


I took this photo in Iraq in 2007, [which] was the bloodiest year of the war. I went with Damien and Diana Cave, a husband and wife who are also a reporter and videographer, into the Sunni triangle to do a story on some American soldiers who had been ambushed and kidnapped. They eventually turned up dead. As American soldiers went out to search for them, they also were being ambushed and killed. We went out before dawn with the 10th Mountain Division, and as we walked down trails through the countryside and the sun began to creep up over the horizon, I stepped over a landmine [that] had been buried in the trail and a guy behind me stepped on it and was killed instantly. A number of others were wounded, and I helped bandage them as I photographed. The Pentagon tried to stop publication of these photos. I actually had a bizarre phone call with a colonel in Washington, DC, who kept coming up with new reasons why I couldn't publish these photos. The New York Times backed me, and we published them anyway. When Damien Cave went back to see the unit, a year or two later, they called him into a conference room. He went in with some trepidation, afraid of what might happen. Instead, the soldiers thanked him profusely for telling Americans back home what the war was really like and showing people their sacrifices. Advertisement  
 


This photo is important to me because it's one of the first ones I ever took that really showed environmental devastation happening on this planet. In the States, the big corporations are very sophisticated, and they know how to hide the damage that they're doing. But when you go to Africa, it's just right there. They think no one is paying attention. I took this photo in Nigeria, in 2005, before there were really cell phone cameras around. The New York Times ran it on the front page. It served as a small piece of evidence of how several petroleum companies continue to flare gas to the present day and it is one of West Africa's major contributors to pollution and climate change. Advertisement  This picture shows young children playing at night in their village, which is bisected by massive pipelines and gas players. Gas is a byproduct of the company's drilling for oil. And they burn off millions and millions of cubic feet of it, destroying the environment and warming the planet.
 


I took this picture in the South Bronx in 1988; I believe there was a building full of artists who are squatting in an abandoned building around the corner from where I lived on Willis Avenue, got to know them, and began to photograph their struggle, as the city started to evict them. In this photo the squatters are stringing barbed wire to keep city marshals from entering the building and evicting them. I was relatively young; I was still working construction and learning to photograph at night and on the weekends. I learned the importance of finding a good story with good visuals and access, to tell the story of what people were going through and get at the larger social issues around poverty, race, and class that were dividing America then, and are dividing America even more so now.

This photo is by Trevon Blondet — he’s part of a group of Bronx photographers that I’ve been helping to train for quite a few years. Trevon has really taken to shooting black and white film with an old Hasselblad camera, and he’s great with people and has a real instinct for a good photo. He’s been doing portraits in a Bronx housing project where he once grew up, and I love everything about this photo: the composition, light, and feeling of a confident young man trying to move into adulthood on a hot summer afternoon in the South Bronx. And of course it’s incredibly rewarding to see a student like Trevon take what you show him and then surpass you.
 


This photo is by Johis Alarcón, and she’s been part of our Latin American Photo Festival that we put on every year here in the Bronx. Johis has been working on all kinds of social, humanitarian, and gender issues in Ecuador as well as documenting indigenous religious and cultural practices throughout the country. She really connects with people and has a wonderful sense of color, movement, and emotion in her photos. In her work, there is also a sense of trying to capture something that is threatened, that may not last, and that has to be seen and remembered. There is a tremendous documentary photography movement happening throughout South and Central America, most of it based on photo collectives, and Johis is part of that movement.
 


I’ve worked with Stephanie Sinclair going back to the Iraq War, and we’ve exhibited her Too Young To Wed project at the Bronx Documentary Center, where it made an enormous impact on the community. Stephanie has been working on this project for a decade in dozens of countries. This photo is from Yemen, where Stephanie documented a tradition of young girls being married off to older men. For me, this photo really brings home the exploitation of young girls all over the world as they are forced into various kinds of subjugation. It varies by region and culture, but it’s happening everywhere. Too Young to Wed has been shown around the globe and — in the best tradition of photojournalism and documentary photography — brought major attention to this issue. Advertisement

When the first season of the Netflix docuseries Cheer debuted in January 2020, it was a commercial and critical hit. The show, about a group of cheerleaders at Navarro Junior College in Corsicana, Texas, and their coach, Monica Aldama, put the tremendous hard work and athleticism of cheerleaders on full display.But while the show challenged people’s perceptions of how much effort goes into cheerleading, it also veered into precarious myths of toxic positivity, with its emphasis on young people sacrificing their bodies for the sake of the team. And most jarring of all was the October 2020 arrest of fan-favorite Jerry Harris for alleged sexual assault. Advertisement     Given this context, it’s surprising that the series’ creator and executive producer, Greg Whiteley, opted to do a second season of the show. “I am a huge believer in the power of stories and telling them honestly,” Whiteley said this past December when it was announced that the show would be returning. “I believe the story is going to ultimately be the best version of itself when you are honoring what is true, and you’re not running from it.” The second season, out today, is evenly split between the Navarro College cheerleaders and their rivals, the underdogs at Trinity Valley College, who reside about 45 minutes down the road in Athens, Texas, and are coached by Javontae Johnson.While the dramatic stakes are compelling and we see the return of familiar faces — including the self-assured La’Darius Marshall; the tumbler Lexi Brumback, who appears to be enjoying the various income opportunities of fame; and the all-star Gabi Butler — there’s a sense of unease that permeates the season because of the real-life criminal charges against Harris, who appears throughout the first half of the season. Harris, 22, was charged with one count of producing child sexual abuse images and for allegedly soliciting nudes from minors in October 2020; he was hit with subsequent charges just months later. (Harris denied the accusations in a statement to ABC News in September 2020, but when questioned by authorities he allegedly admitted to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in 2019. He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago since his arrest in September 2020 and no trial date has been set.)One episode halfway through the season, titled “Jerry,” is solely about the allegations and includes on-camera interviews with the victims of his alleged abuse and their mother. Harris’s former teammates frequently express shock, saying they never would have guessed he could commit such crimes.But given how the show depicts competitive cheerleading, it’s not hard to imagine how this sort of behavior would have flown under the radar. Aldama and her assistant coaches are frequently dismissive of the athletes' feelings. When cheerleaders who train hard for months only to not make mat (qualifying for the team that will perform at finals) are reasonably disappointed, Aldama is quick to shut down their chatter from the sidelines because they’re “being so negative,” as she says in one episode. The culture of toxic positivity, of always needing to put on a brave or smiling face and perfect their routine for the sake of the team, could make athletes feel uncomfortable speaking up about abuse. Advertisement     In the episode addressing the impact of Harris’s allegations on the lives of his former teammates, a Good Morning America clip plays. Aldama appears on a video call with the other contestants joining her for Season 29 of Dancing With the Stars. Meant to be a surprise, the morning show’s host cuts to Harris, who appears onscreen, hyping his coach up with his high-pitched voice and infectious enthusiasm. “Congratulations, Monica!” Harris screeches. “I’m so, so happy for you. I can’t wait to vote for you every week.” The former cheerleader’s spirited disposition is disarming, and from the many clips shown, this is pretty much the only side we see of him, save for the instances where he discusses his difficult upbringing.While it might be tough for some to imagine how a person with such a seemingly bright personality could be the source of pain for younger, more impressionable athletes participating in the sport, this dynamic is not uncommon when it comes to abuse. The episode where twin brothers Sam and Charlie tell their story explores how the public perception of Harris almost prevented them from coming forward. “[Harris] messaged me on my private Instagram account on his private Instagram account and like basically just saying, ‘Hey,’ and he asked how old I was,” Charlie says in the episode, recounting an incident that he says occurred during his first cheerleading season in December 2018. “And I told him that I was 13 and then after that, right off the bat, he asked me, ‘Can I have butt pics?’” At the time, Harris was 19.The episode captures how difficult it can be for sexual assault victims, especially minors, to speak out. Charlie and Sam knew of Harris long before he started messaging them on Snapchat because he was a rising star on one of their favorite cheer teams. They didn’t want to tell their story, at least at first, because it meant they would be ostracized by their peers, people who looked up to Harris. “It made me lose even more faith, I guess, in like just having a safe community in cheer,” Sam said, right after his brother said Harris cornered him in a bathroom during a practice event, demanding sex. Even after being charged with these crimes, Harris still exudes a puzzling optimism. His lawyers, according to Netflix, declined to be interviewed on camera, but Aldama said Harris wrote her a letter saying one day he hoped to become a motivational speaker. If convicted, Harris faces a minimum 15-year prison sentence.Throughout this season, it feels like Cheer is trying to toe the line between telling hard, uncomfortable truths about the sport of competitive cheerleading while also being inspirational television. In Season 1, you could actively applaud the Navarro team and its dedication to the sport, looking past the injuries the athletes sustained and the broken homes they escaped to make their dreams a reality. But Season 2, which was shot in 2020 and 2021, before and then during the pandemic, it feels icky to witness. Advertisement     Observing the young cheerleaders push past their breaking point and, even worse, seeing how the coaches poorly handle their emotions when it comes to the athletes’ needs illuminates the overwhelming stress of the sport. “So TT’s out until next Tuesday,” Aldama says in Episode 3’s “Dracut Girl,” referring to a stunter, visibly annoyed by the delays this will cause for the team’s tight practice schedule. “Seems extreme,” she says, right before briefly walking outside of the gym because she needed a “new attitude.” TT’s exact ailment isn’t addressed, but there’s an acknowledgment that he has had “headaches.” That Aldama doesn’t seem sympathetic to his pain is concerning.Understandably, no one handles their emotions well every single time, and Aldama and the assistants are human like anyone else, but as the season continues, you begin to pick up on several instances where the leaders come across as cold and indifferent to various dilemmas pertaining to the cheerleaders. Even when it comes to the emotional needs of the cheerleaders, it often feels like the coaches don’t think about how their decisions impact players. There’s another scene in that same episode where newcomer Maddy is replaced in a stunt routine without a proper heads-up about the abrupt switch. Moments later, she breaks down crying. “How did I go from being center stunt to not being there at all?” she asks Aldama through tears. “I could’ve gotten, like, a warning before practice.” It doesn’t feel like the cheerleader’s concerns are adequately validated, as everything — even minor expressions of dissent — comes back to the needs of the team. “If we make a decision that I feel is best for the team, I need you to support that, all right?” Aldama says.While watching Cheer, you will undoubtedly marvel at the incredible stunts the athletes are able to pull off, and you’ll likely tear up when listening to some of the neophytes talk about their journey into the sport, as well as their hopes and dreams for after. But the darker side of cheer makes for tough viewing. As the pandemic continues, some athletes question whether it was worth it to leave their hometowns for the chance to train at Navarro. By the end of the season, some choose not to return. Cheer will likely be a hit for Netflix once again, but this time it’s harder to find anyone to root for. ●

300,"“If you’re committed, you went all the way.”","At long last, Season 2 of Euphoria is finally here. Over two years since its first season premiered, the hit HBO series, which stars Zendaya, finally returned to screens on Sunday with an action-packed first episode. And despite a generous serving of onscreen drama, a particular behind-the-scenes moment still managed to divert some of the attention. So, if you’ve watched the first episode already, you’ll know that Season 2 is set to welcome a number of new characters to the show’s star-studded ensemble. However, the addition of a few new faces didn't stop fans from doing a double-take after spotting an imposter in a newly surfaced snap of the cast. On Monday, photographer Siyon Foster celebrated the launch of Season 2 with a backstage photo dump, providing fans on Instagram with a selection of brand-new behind-the-scenes shots that look to have been taken while shooting episode one. Upon further inspection of the gallery, eagle-eyed viewers noticed an eerie figure lurking in the background of a group photograph, a familiar peace sign peeking out from behind Zendaya, who posed with her costars. In case you’ve not already guessed, fans collectively identified the silhouette as Zendaya’s boyfriend, Tom Holland, inevitably prompting a LOT of excitement on social media. Before we proceed, we must preface that the picture in question is pretty dark and grainy, making it nearly impossible to say for certain if it’s Tom, or just someone who resembles him. (Not to mention that he’s also wearing a mask, which — while praiseworthy — does not help with the investigation.) Nonetheless, I think we can pretty safely assume that the masked individual huddled behind Zendaya is probably who we think it is. Especially given that Tom recently revealed that he visited the set ""at least 30 times"" while they shot Season 2. If you know anything about Tom and Zendaya, that piece of information probably won’t come as a surprise to you, particularly in light of the fact that the Spider-Man star has made no secret of his desire to get involved with Euphoria. Stepping away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe for a moment, Tom explained during an interview in December that he had been “petitioning” for a role on the hit series. “It has not happened yet and I'm very disappointed,” he said at the time. “I want to be in Euphoria!” And given that Zendaya also serves as an executive producer on the show, the idea that she might be able to wrangle a cameo for her boyfriend doesn’t seem out of the question. However, despite his promising appearance behind the scenes, it sounds a lot like we might have to wait a bit longer to get the Marvel/Euphoria crossover we deserve. Addressing the cameo speculation during a conversation with E! News on Jan. 7, Zendaya hinted that she actually asked the show’s producers if they could work in an appearance for Tom. “I mean, listen, we've talked about it all the time,” she said. “We're like, ‘Let's just sneak him in the back of a shot or something!’” So, while it seems unlikely that we’ll be seeing Tom’s face in this season of Euphoria, we’ve certainly got our hopes up for the future. And besides, if there’s one thing to be learned from his recent performance in Spider-Man: No Way Home, it’s that Tom knows a thing or two about legendary crossovers. And we’ll leave it at that."
301,"In the second season of Netflix’s Cheer, we see an even uglier side of the sport.","Unless you’ve been living under a rock lately, you’re probably aware that Ghostface is back in town for a brand-new installment of the horror movie franchise Scream. The new movie, which is set for release this week, has been described as “an absolute, brand-new relaunch of the franchise” by star Courteney Cox, who also appeared in the original 1996 movie. But its release has still served as an excuse for the OG cast to enjoy a reunion, with Courteney joining Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Drew Barrymore for a candid chat on The Drew Barrymore Show this week. As the group discussed their experiences on set, Drew recalled having a pregnancy scare that left her “freaking out” — and how she turned to Courteney for help through it. Drew only briefly appeared in the movie but featured prominently in the promo leading up to its release, which gave her plenty of time to bond with her costar. Speaking to Courteney on the show, Drew reflected: “We became so close, Courteney. I remember at the poster shoot I was, like, having a nervous breakdown because I was having a false sense of being pregnant.” “I kept asking you, 'How do you know if you're pregnant? Like, I'm freaking out! We're supposed to shoot this poster but oh my god, I just started dating somebody! How do you know?’” Drew continued. “I felt safe going to you, like you were the mature, safe person in the room.” It turns out that Drew had no reason to panic because it was a false alarm, and the star didn't become a mom for another 16 years when she welcomed her daughter Olive with ex-husband Will Kopelman. While Drew may not have given us the first Scream child, Courteney and David reflected on how their daughter is a direct result of the franchise and how much the movie changed their lives in every possible way. Their daughter Coco was born in June 2004, with David telling Drew: “We had a daughter out of it and she's the greatest thing in my life. That really is the most impactful thing that has ever happened to me in this business.” Courteney echoed his sentiments, with the pair still on good terms despite calling it quits on their relationship in 2013. The Friends star also admitted that Scream had changed her life in a way that most fans can probably relate to, explaining: “I will not go to the bathroom in a movie theater or just about any sports arena.” And for that, I have to admit, I don’t blame her."
302,How about that Euphoria/Marvel crossover?,"


Hundreds of New York City teenagers at dozens of public high schools walked out of class on Tuesday in protest of the city requirement that students must attend school in person.“Students have to juggle this decision of whether to come to school to pursue their education or to stay home and keep themselves and their families safe,” Rommy Sasson, a junior at Brooklyn Tech and one of the five walkout organizers, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     
 


“It’s to show that we’ve had enough,” said Dora Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Brooklyn Tech and another organizer.Teens from Brooklyn Technical High School and Stuyvesant High School, among the city’s top selective public schools, organized the walkout after they grew concerned with New York’s rising COVID numbers over winter break and were frustrated that they cannot do remote learning. Organizer Cruz Warshaw, a junior at Stuyvesant, estimated that more than 30 city schools had students walk out at 11:52 a.m., which is at the end of fifth period at Brooklyn Tech.
 


New York City began its extreme COVID surge in December due to the Omicron variant, and on Monday, the city reported 35,371 new COVID cases. Not only are cases rising, but people are also having a hard time finding rapid and PCR tests. Yet, Eric Adams, mayor of New York City, said Sunday that schools must remain open. ""I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building,"" he told Face the Nation.But high school students disagree about just how safe school is for them — particularly when many live with older relatives or unvaccinated younger siblings. Chan, who lives with her grandparents, is so fearful about making them ill that she’s missed school for the past week.“If I were to get COVID and come back home to my grandparents, who are at risk, I don’t even want to say it,” Chan said. “We all know that COVID could result in death, and so it’s a really, really bleak reality that all New York City students are facing today.”Students returned after winter break just last week, but the teens told BuzzFeed News that school didn’t feel normal — teachers and students were absent due to sickness or fear of getting sick, and classrooms felt empty and tense. Advertisement     “The atmosphere at school has been much more of defeat and worry these past few days,” Sasson said. “That has been weighing on everyone’s mental health.”Online school is no longer available to New York City students, as a citywide policy.
 


For Rifah Saba, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, she said it’s “disheartening” to know government officials don’t value students’ health and safety. Saba called lunchtime at her school “appalling.”“The cafeteria is the biggest, most appalling COVID regulation violation you could see because it’s people in close contact, people with their masks down huddled together in a group,” she said.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sarah Casasnovas, the deputy press secretary for NYC schools, said the city’s Department of Education supports the “civic engagement” from the students.“Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our school communities, and we’ve doubled in-school testing and deployed 5 million rapid tests to quickly identify cases, stop transmission, and safely keep schools open,” the statement read. “Student voice is key and we’ll continue to listen to and work closely with those most impacted by our decisions — our students.” Advertisement     The walkout had an immediate effect: The organizers are meeting with Chancellor David C. Banks on Wednesday to discuss ideas and concerns.These students have already gone through one school year doing remote learning, so they understand it’s not ideal. Chan said her learning suffered because of it. But because cases are so high right now, these students believe it’s the only safe option.“It’s scary,” Chan said. “I really, really think the city needs to understand this. The students know remote learning is bad. Teachers know it’s bad too. But we’re saying that yes, but still because of public safety. Public safety needs to come first when we’re in this circumstance.”Chan said that the walkout faced criticism on Twitter, mainly from older people, but she wants to stress that the students who walked out risked getting in trouble. Also, older people might not understand what it’s like because they aren’t going to high school during a global pandemic.“When we see hundreds and hundreds of students taking this risk and not knowing if it would actually work out, it shows something about this generation,” Chan said. “We all collectively are united on this sentiment that schools need to shut down now.”

303,"Drew got super real about the false alarm as she reunited with her former costars ahead of Scream’s relaunch, and it turns out that it isn’t just Ghostface that gave her the heebie jeebies on set.","In spring 2021, pop culture enthusiasts everywhere rejoiced as it was revealed that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck had started dating again — almost 20 years after they broke up. Bennifer were initially a staple power couple of the ‘00s, dating for two years between 2002 and 2004 and even getting engaged before calling it quits. Over the next 17 years, the pair went their separate ways as they started families and found love with new partners. Jennifer married singer Marc Anthony in June 2004 — just five months after her split from Ben — and the pair welcomed twins before breaking up in 2011. She went on to have relationships with dancer Casper Smart, and New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez (below). Meanwhile, Ben shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner, who he was married to between 2005 and 2018. After their breakup, he dated actor Ana de Armas. But in living proof that true love will always find a way, the former couple reconnected in 2021; first romantically linked in April before Jennifer publicly confirmed their romance in July. The pair have been relatively low-key about their reunion, but made their red carpet debut at Venice Film Festival in September in support of Ben’s movie The Last Duel, before attending the Met Gala together just days later. And in December, Ben spoke candidly about his decision to get back with Jennifer, admitting that he was initially hesitant to take the plunge due to the toll the media scrutiny could take on his children. During an interview with Howard Stern, Ben was asked: “Was there hesitation on your part, because now you’re a dad? Was there hesitation on your part to say, you know, 'I can’t go through this again'?” Ben replied: “It crossed my mind for sure. My responsibility to my children is the highest responsibility, I don’t want to do anything that is painful or destructive to them if I can help it.” But just weeks later, it appears that Bennifer 2.0 is still going from strength to strength, with Ben even at the forefront of Jennifer’s resolutions for 2022. Taking to her Instagram page on Tuesday, the singer spoke openly about her plans for the year, sharing: “I’m just thinking about being really mindful about what I want my life to be, and knowing my thoughts create my life, so keeping those really positive.” Jennifer went on: “To be the best mother I can be, the best partner I can be, the best friend I can be, the best daughter, sister, boss, person that I can be.” The vows came as Ben offered a fresh insight into his and Jennifer’s relationship during a new interview published on Tuesday, in which he opened up about the romance's origin story in 2001. The pair first met on the set of the movie Gigli, which was released in 2003 but began filming two years earlier. The movie bombed at the box office and received widely negative reviews. Despite Gigli’s lack of acclaim, Ben has fond memories of it — largely because it introduced him to Jennifer. In a new interview with Matt Damon for Entertainment Weekly, Ben shared: “If the reaction to Gigli hadn't happened, I probably wouldn't have ultimately decided, 'I don't really have any other avenue but to direct movies,' which has turned out to be the real love of my professional life. So in those ways, it's a gift.” He added: “And I did get to meet Jennifer, the relationship with whom has been really meaningful to me in my life."" Ben previously acknowledged how “lucky” he is to have ""benefitted from second chances"" throughout his life, telling WSJ magazine for its December/January cover story: “I've had second chances in my career. I've had second chances as a human being."" Thankfully, he and Jennifer both seem to be making the most of their second chance at their relationship."

A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined to dismiss a sexual assault lawsuit against Prince Andrew, who is being sued by a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him while she was a minor and under the control of former financier Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Lewis Kaplan said in his ruling that he denied ""in all respects"" the duke's attempts to stop the case.The decision is the latest blow against Andrew, who has consistently denied the accusations of Virginia Giuffre, now 38, and a vocal critic of the justice system’s failures in the Epstein case. The Duke of York’s lawyers have unsuccessfully fought to have the civil lawsuit thrown out for months. Advertisement     In the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Giuffre says Andrew sexually abused her on multiple occasions between 2000 and 2002 while knowing that she was a sex trafficking victim under the age of 18. Specifically, Giuffre says she was forced to engage in sex acts with the duke in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands.Andrew was a longtime friend and associate of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Epstein’s former girlfriend and recently convicted coconspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein killed himself in a federal detention center in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and abusing dozens of underage girls, some as young as 14. Maxwell, 60, was found guilty of federal sex trafficking charges for her role in Epstein’s illicit operation on Dec. 29. She could face up to 65 years in prison.Giuffre first publicly accused Andrew of sexual assault in a sworn statement for a different Epstein-related lawsuit in December 2014. She then sued Andrew for battery and emotional damages on Aug. 9, 2021, under New York’s Child Victims Act of 2019, a temporary law that allowed people over the age of 55 to file civil lawsuits related to childhood sexual abuse — no matter how long ago the incident — but only during a limited time period.The duke and his legal team have fought from the beginning to make Giuffre's case go away. Andrew was able to avoid being served for nearly a month — and even then, his legal team at first claimed that he had not been properly presented with the official documents under UK and international law. (Kaplan rejected this argument in a ruling dated Sept. 17.) Advertisement     
 


Before the hearing, Kaplan rejected a defense motion that attempted to delay proceedings based on the argument that Giuffre primarily resides in Australia and not the United States. The judge also ordered the unsealing of a 2009 secret settlement between Epstein and Giuffre, which Andrew’s legal team claimed included a clause preventing her from suing the royal.In the hearing, the duke’s lawyer Andrew Brettler questioned the constitutionality of the Child Victims Act and cited Giuffre’s 2009 settlement of a sex trafficking case against Epstein in his arguments to dismiss charges on Tuesday. He also argued that Giuffre had not been explicit enough in her allegations against Andrew, which led to a tense moment in the virtual courtroom.""Ms. Giuffre doesn't articulate what supposedly happened to her at the hands of Prince Andrew,"" he said. “We do not know the details of the allegations, and it's time that we do before Prince Andrew should be required to answer these very serious allegations."" Advertisement     “That's not a dog that's going to hunt here,” Kaplan responded, saying that Giuffre’s claim that she had been forced to engage in sexual intercourse was specific enough for the current stage of the proceedings.The judge emphasized this in his ruling. ""Ms. Giuffre's complaint is neither 'unintelligible' nor 'vague' nor 'ambiguous,'"" he wrote. ""It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations. It identifies to whom it attributes that sexual abuse.""Kaplan also shot down the defense's arguments about the constitutionality of the Child Victim's Act, saying that it had been upheld in the face of other legal challenges. (He called Brettler's argument ""creative"" but ""without merit."")A provision in the 2009 settlement between ​​Giuffre and Epstein prohibits her from pursuing legal action against the financier and anyone who “could have been included as a potential defendant” in that matter. Although the document does not name Andrew, Brettler argued that he should be included in the “potential defendant” category.Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies disagreed, saying that the 2009 settlement only concerned sex trafficking.“​​There is no allegation that Prince Andrew was the person transporting. There is no allegation that Prince Andrew fell into the category of people who were doing the trafficking,” Boies said. “He was somebody to whom the girls were trafficked.""Kaplan sided with Boies on this point in his opinion, saying the settlement does not preclude Andrew from facing Giuffre's accusations in a court of law. Advertisement     ""The 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, that the parties intended the instrument 'directly,' 'primarily,' or substantially 'to benefit Prince Andrew,'"" he wrote. ""The Court cannot rewrite the 2009 agreement to give the defendant rights where the agreement does not clearly manifest an intent to create them.""The next key date in the case is Jan. 14, when Giuffre’s legal team will respond to discovery requests from Andrew’s attorneys.Andrew is ninth in line to the British throne. He stepped back from royal life following a disastrous BBC interview in November 2019, in which he denied dancing with or meeting Giuffre — despite having been pictured with his arm around her waist (Andrew said he had no memory of the photograph being taken). He also disputed Giuffre’s allegation that he sweated on her while dancing at a London club by claiming that he cannot perspire as a result of his military experience in the Falkland Islands.Giuffre’s lawyers have requested as part of the discovery process proof of this medical condition and evidence that he was, as he told the BBC, attending a birthday party at a Pizza Express with his daughter on the date of one of the alleged assaults.

Clyde Bellecourt, a longtime leader in Native Americans' fight for civil rights, died Tuesday from cancer, his wife told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. He was 85.In 1968, Bellecourt helped found the American Indian Movement, which began as a local group in Minneapolis fighting against police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. The AIM did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News, but confirmed his death to the Associated Press. Advertisement     ""He loved the Native people,"" his wife Peggy Bellecourt told the Star Tribune. ""He loved being out there, trying to help improve conditions.""The organization widened its scope to take on national issues and went on to lead major protests nationwide in the 1970s, including a march to Washington, DC, known as the Trail of Broken Treaties. The demonstration was aimed at highlighting the federal government's failure to fulfill treaty obligations.In 1973, AIM led a 71-day occupation of the town of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota to protest the US and tribal governments. The occupation turned violent and two people were killed.
 


Bellecourt was also known for protesting major professional sports teams for using Native Americans as their mascots and in their names.""America is scholastically retarded about Indian culture and history and how the West was really won,"" Bellecourt said in 1991 during a protest at an Atlanta Braves game. ""It is pure ignorance.""He continued to lead AIM until 2020, when he stepped aside due to health issues, according to Indian Country Today.

Two men have been arrested in connection to the fatal shooting of rapper Young Dolph in Tennessee last year, but law enforcement officials on Wednesday said they have yet to determine a motive in the deadly shooting.Investigators are still sorting through a slew of tips, information, rumors, and innuendo to pin down why the two suspects — one of them a rapper — allegedly carried out the killing. Advertisement     ""We're just not ready to put this out yet,"" Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said at a news conference Wednesday.Young Dolph, whose given name is Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., was shot at Makeda's Homemade Butter Cookies in Memphis in November. The 36-year-old made his debut in 2008 with ""Paper Route Campaign"" and built a reputation as one of the most prolific rappers in the industry, at one point making a music video from his hospital room after being shot in Los Angeles in 2017. His collaborators included Megan Thee Stallion and Gucci Mane, and he often worked with his fellow Memphis rapper and protégé Key Glock.
 


There were no suspects immediately after the shooting but, on Jan. 5, the US Marshals Service and Memphis Police announced a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Justin Johnson, a Memphis native and rapper who goes by the name of Straight Drop.Johnson had stated on social media on Monday that he planned to turn himself in, according to a statement from the Shelby County District Attorney's Office. But ultimately, he didn't.Instead, Johnson was taken into custody in Indiana Tuesday, the US Marshals officials said in a statement. Johnson was found after officials received more than 500 tips, largely prompted by the reward, officials said.Johnson also had an outstanding warrant for violating the terms of his supervised federal release, according to the statement.A third man, 27-year-old Shondele Barnett, was also taken into custody along with Johnson and facing charges of being an accessory after the fact. Barnett is suspected of aiding Johnson as the two traveled through Indiana during the manhunt.On Tuesday, the Shelby County district attorney also announced that a grand jury had charged a second man, 32-year-old Cornelius Smith, with first-degree murder and a second count of attempted first-degree murder in connection to the deadly shooting on Nov. 17.Smith was arrested on Dec. 9 on an auto theft warrant for a white Mercedes-Benz, the vehicle authorities believe was used in the killing of Dolph.The car was stolen on Nov. 10 and found on Nov. 20, three days after the deadly shooting.Smith is in custody in Shelby County Jail.Johnson has not yet been charged in the killing, but Davis said an indictment was forthcoming.Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said Johnson had a lengthy criminal record that included an aggravated rape and aggravated robbery conviction when he was 17. In 2017, Johnson was convicted and served five years after shooting three people in a bowling alley.He was released nine months into his sentence, Weirich said, and in 2018, was indicted on a federal gun charge.He had been released from federal custody in May 2021.On Wednesday, officials declined to released more details about the November shooting, but said they had enough information to name Johnson as a person of interest in the shooting. An indictment, Davis said, was forthcoming.""We had enough probable cause to put out this wanted flyer for Johnson and we have enough information to ensure that he will see his day in court,"" Davis said.

An attorney for one of the defendants in the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has launched a direct attack on the credibility of the prosecution, claiming it misrepresented its knowledge of the actions of a key FBI informant whom it recently disparaged as a rogue “double agent.”The informant, Stephen Robeson, was accused last week by prosecutors of disobeying FBI rules and undermining the investigation into an alleged conspiracy to kidnap Whitmer and try her for treason. Among Robeson’s offenses, they claimed, was “offering use of 501(c) charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks.” Advertisement     But according to a new filing Tuesday by the attorney for defendant Adam Fox, the FBI was well aware that Robeson had made such offers. The filing includes a transcript of an August 2020 recording — listened to by two of the lead FBI agents in the probe — in which another informant tells Fox that the charity was used to purchase weapons.“While the Government attempts to minimize his involvement and its knowledge of the same,” the attorney, Christopher Gibbons, wrote, “the FBI maintained an intimate knowledge and control of [Robeson] and his activities.”A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the matter, referring inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Michigan also declined to comment, citing official policy to not discuss ongoing criminal matters.The five men facing federal trial in the case claim that they were entrapped by the government — and in particular by Robeson and another FBI informant, both of whom worked to recruit potential suspects, organize events such as the surveillance of Gov. Whitmer’s vacation home, and make hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings. The defendants also contend that there was no true conspiracy to kidnap anyone, and that the only planning was done by the FBI and its operatives. Advertisement     Prosecutors have pushed back, arguing that the defendants were predisposed to take violent action against the governor because of the strict COVID policies she had implemented. But they have also asked the judge to sharply limit the evidence that can be admitted into court when the trial begins March 8.They have, for example, said that they will not call three lead FBI agents in the case, and argued that many of the statements those men made during the course of the investigation should not be allowed as evidence. And last week they said that because of his misconduct, statements by Robeson should also be kept out of the courtroom.Robeson, who had been convicted of multiple felonies dating back to the early 1980s, began work for the FBI on Oct. 20, 2019, new evidence disclosed in Tuesday’s filing reveals, and was terminated as a confidential informant on Oct. 28, 2020, three weeks after the defendants in the Michigan case were arrested. The FBI paid him $19,328.79 for his work, the new evidence shows, and he helped organize at least four events that the government highlighted as critical in the evolution of the alleged conspiracy, even going so far as to pay for pizza, “moonshine,” and hotel rooms for attendees.While he was still working on the case, Robeson acquired a .50 caliber sniper rifle despite prohibitions on gun ownership by people with felony convictions. He was indicted last March in federal court on the gun charge and agreed to a plea deal in September. That deal, which offered him no jail time despite his extensive record and a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years, was an extremely favorable one — particularly if, as prosecutors now allege, they knew he had been secretly working “against the interests of the government.” Advertisement     Last month, Robeson was charged again, this time in Wisconsin state court. Notably, he is alleged to have defrauded a couple out of an SUV by convincing them it was going to a charity he controlled. Investigators found that there was no such charity and that Robeson had simply kept the vehicle for his own use. That fraud is alleged to have taken place during the same month that the two FBI agents overheard the conversation about Robeson’s use of a charity to acquire weaponry.In their filing last Thursday, prosecutors called Robeson a “noncompliant informant,” saying he undertook a number of “unauthorized acts,” including offering the charity funds, obtaining weapons, and offering to use a drone “to aid in acts of terrorism.” They also claim he failed to record certain events he was supposed to be informing the FBI about, attempted to destroy other evidence, and warned at least one defendant that he’d been approached by the government.Citing those reasons, prosecutors took the unusual step of arguing that his statements and actions while working for the FBI should be excluded from the case.In Tuesday’s filing, Gibbons challenged that argument. “The Government consistently relied on a specific cadre of agents and confidential informants from as early as October 2019 to October of 2020 in establishing its case against these defendants. The Government now seeks to distance itself from the very same group agents and informants, and their inconvenient actions and statements during the upcoming jury trial.” Advertisement     A hearing on what evidence will be admitted at trial is scheduled for next Tuesday in federal court.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

311,The 36-year-old had built a reputation as one of the most prolific rappers in the industry.,"


In his second sweeping speech on voting rights as president, Joe Biden made his most forceful rebuke to date of Senate Republicans for blocking laws that would protect voters. But six months on from Biden's first address calling for the bills to pass, they're still far from becoming a reality.“I ask every elected official in America, how do you want to be remembered? Consequential moments in history, they present a choice,” Biden said. “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? You want to be the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? You want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Advertisement     Biden for the first time made it clear that he supports changing Senate rules to pass voting rights reform. That would require amending the way the Senate works for these specific bills so that they can pass with a simple majority instead of the current requirement of 60 votes to end a filibuster. Despite the president’s overt support for that change on Tuesday, it’s unlikely to happen. Two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have so far said they won’t vote for it, and several others are publicly undecided. Every Senate Democrat would need to vote to change the rules for the move to succeed.“We have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this,” Biden said. “The filibuster is not being used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart. The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.”Two landmark bills remain stalled in the Senate, and voting rights activists say they’ve yet to see a concrete plan from the White House on how they’ll get it passed. Biden’s remarks on Tuesday largely repeated his rhetoric from July 2021, when he gave a speech in Philadelphia, and from his calls on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.""I've been around the Senate a long time, and as vice president for eight years. I've never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice and is ready to speak for justice,” Biden said of Senate Republicans on Tuesday. Advertisement     He added that he had even worked with Sen. Strom Thurmond, a segregationist Republican, to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act at one point.He struck a much firmer tone with Republicans this week than he had last July, when Biden said he would be asking his “Republican friends — in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties — to stand up, for god’s sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote.”Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta to give the speeches despite several prominent local voting rights leaders boycotting their event, calling on them to stay in DC and get the legislation passed.“We were hoping that would be followed by the White House leaning into this issue of the legislation and the filibuster,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, of Biden’s July speech. “That did not happen, and that is why we're at the place where right now where what we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan.”The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban partisan gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reestablish the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters.For some, Biden’s visit brought welcome attention to the restrictive voting measures being put in place in Georgia.“We have been raising the alarm. It's not even canary in the coal mine anymore. It's like, the British are here. They’re not coming,” said Nsé Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. “So this is an unqualified recognition that the fight for voting rights is the most important fight for our government right now, for our leaders right now.” Advertisement     Ufot, like others on the ground, said she’s waiting to see what action follows this speech.“If my president and my vice president see this as an important intervention on the path to getting us the voting rights protections that our country needs right now, then I’m with it. Go for it,” Ufot said. “But what I'm saying is that we need a plan. We need a plan. We need to share the plan to get legislation passed.”NAACP President Derrick Johnson said he was “agnostic” on whether Biden and Harris should travel to Georgia on Tuesday. After the speech, he said in a statement that Biden “delivered a stirring speech today” but that “it’s time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job.”

313,"Prosecutors say the informant’s statements should be barred from court, but defense attorneys have other ideas.","Kendall Jenner has finally spoken out about the little black dress that divided the internet. In case you need reminding, the 26-year-old found herself at the center of an explosive debate back in November after she attended the wedding of her friend, Lauren Perez, wearing a particularly eye-catching look. The black Mônot dress in question — which Kendall wore for the wedding reception — was aptly described by Vogue as a “skin-baring technical feat” and consisted of carefully placed triangular cutouts that exposed her bare midriff. And so, while she’s usually celebrated for her show-stopping looks on the runway, Kendall’s head-turning party dress caused quite the stir among fans who felt that it wasn’t appropriate for the occasion. Spiraling into a wider debate about wedding guest etiquette, some even accused Kendall of trying to upstage Lauren on her special day, suggesting that the fashion choice had been “blatantly disrespectful.” Thankfully, both ladies have now entered the chat to finally set the record straight. So, just when we thought we’d heard the last of the matter, the dress debate was reignited on New Year’s Eve after Lauren shared some snaps from her big day. “The greatest night of 2021! Happy New Year everyone!!!” the newlywed captioned her NYE Instagram post, which included several new photographs of Kendall’s afterparty attire. Once again, the risqué dress drew criticism from fans, including one who commented on the post calling the look ""inappropriate"" and ""cringe."" “Inappropriate outfit at a wedding @kendalljenner, I'm embarrassed for you. #cringe,” the user wrote. But not everyone shared the same sentiments. Taking the other side of the debate, another fan quickly hit back, asking: “If the bride herself doesn't gaf, why do you care, relax?” The exchange caught the attention of the bride, who put speculation to rest by backing up the second fan. “Tell ‘em!” Lauren wrote in agreement. “SHE LOOKED STUNNING AND I LOVED IT!” Swiftly weighing in for herself, Kendall broke her silence on the matter to confirm that she had sought the bride’s approval beforehand. “Obvi asked for your approval in advance too,” the model wrote in response to her friend. “We love a beach wedding.” And there you have it. Interestingly, Lauren has since removed all comments from the post, hopefully marking an official conclusion to the months-spanning debate. Meanwhile, another wedding conspiracy involving Kendall still remains unsolved. If you’ve been keeping an eye on social media over the last few weeks, you might already have heard whispers that Kendall walked down the aisle herself. Before you get too excited, it’s important we preface that there is a severe lack of evidence to support this fan theory, but feel free to make up your own mind as we present the facts. So, like Lauren, Kendall rang in the new year with an Instagram post of her own, documenting how she and her longtime boyfriend, NBA star Devin Booker, spent the holidays. And while there was plenty to marvel over in the festive photo dump, fans were quick to notice a very ~particular~ piece of jewelry located on Devin’s left ring finger. Inevitably, the presence of a conveniently placed gold band had fans spiraling in the comments section, theorizing that perhaps he and Kendall had tied the knot in secret. But despite fans' optimism, it’s worth noting that (as it stands) Kendall’s left hand appears to be void of any corresponding jewelry, presenting a minor hitch in the ~slightly~ flawed theory. Nonetheless, these two seem pretty happy together, and off the back of her bestie’s wedding, who says it’s out of the question?"

WASHINGTON – At least two congressional staffers from House and Senate committees reached out to the FBI and the Justice Department concerned about security at the Capitol ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The inquiries support accusations that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies were not prepared for the pro-Trump mob that stormed the US Capitol despite direct warnings and calls for help. Advertisement     BuzzFeed News is publishing another cache of documents turned over by the Justice Department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the agency and the FBI related to events around Jan. 6. Emails released last November revealed that top Justice Department officials were told there were “no credible threats” hours before the riot.
 


The House Intelligence Committee on Jan. 5, 2021, requested a threat assessment and clarification on coordination between the FBI and the Defense Department related to the joint session, citing a “heightened public concern” about the role of law enforcement during the presidential transition. Advertisement     “In response, the Committee received a brief and non-substantive reply from the FBI that did not provide any information about potential threats on January 6,” a House Intel committee official told BuzzFeed News in a statement.
 


Another Democratic staffer from the Senate Appropriations Committee sent multiple emails before and during the Capitol riot asking if additional law enforcement would be deployed ahead of Congress’s joint session. The messages highlight the concern some congressional offices felt ahead of the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, where then-president Donald Trump was expected to promote the falsehood of a stolen presidential election.The unidentified Senate staffer’s correspondence with DOJ and the FBI began as early as Jan. 4 and ran until Jan. 7, according to the report. The staffer requested information before Jan. 6 as to which law enforcement agencies were on the ground and which agency was managing the ground forces and asked if DOJ had deployed air assets. But on the day the mob of Trump supporters breached the Capitol, the emails to DOJ took on a new sense of urgency.By 2:45 p.m., 30 minutes after the rioters forced their way into the Capitol and ransacked the Senate chambers, the staffer sent an alarming message inquiring about DOJ’s presence.“Sooooo this has taken a turn for the worse,” the staffer wrote. “Can we have an update as to DOJ involvement, please?”The staffer also emailed the agencies immediately after Jan. 6. The committee would not identify the staffer but confirmed the office was in contact with DOJ and the FBI.
 


“We can confirm this was a staffer on the Appropriations Committee (minority staff at the time) asking relevant and timely questions to the DOJ and FBI, over which the committee has oversight, about a developing situation,” a committee spokesperson said in a statement.The Justice Department turned over additional documents as part of the new FOIA release, including intelligence memos prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI that were sent to state and federal law enforcement agencies before and after the insurrection summarizing threats and the potential for civil unrest. One of the memos notes the FBI had monitored reports about ""various threats to harm"" then-president-elect Joe Biden, vice president–elect Kamala Harris, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Subsequent intelligence memos produced in the weeks following the insurrection tallied the number of tips passed onto the FBI, which by Jan. 21 reached 208,799.Additionally, the Justice Department released a redacted copy of then–acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue's handwritten notes from a Jan. 4, 2021, phone call he had with Michael Sherwin, the then–acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, that discusses crowd estimates and law enforcement plans. Donoghue’s notes say: ""no need for additional resources now.""
 


Congressional leaders peppered FBI and DOJ officials for answers on what they knew in the lead-up to Jan. 6 and how they planned to respond during a closed-door briefing on Jan. 12, according to a transcript of the call released as part of the new FOIA cache. The FBI told members during the briefing that they had issued eight wanted posters for 72 individuals who were captured on camera. A year later, the arrest count exceeds 700.But the Justice Department redacted much of the responses to lawmakers' questions, citing national security, ongoing law enforcement investigations, and law enforcement techniques and procedures.Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, asked about the security threat ahead of Trump’s Jan. 13 impeachment vote and sought to get clarification on whether the temporary fencing erected after the riots was enough protection for the Capitol complex.An FBI representative explained that the physical security of the Capitol and crowd control were not the purview of the agency.“We are not experts in determining if the Capitol was hardened enough.”

315,The rumors reached new heights after a video of Ayesha speaking about lacking “male attention” outside of her and Steph’s marriage resurfaced on Twitter last month.,"


Robin White has worked at Kroger supermarkets in Southern California for seven years and hopes for a promotion to manager, which would raise her pay from $16.65 an hour to $23 and increase her weekly hours from 28 to 40. With the extra income, she said, she and her 9-year-old son would be able to move into their own place, and she’d start saving up to go back to school and become a licensed nursing assistant.Through parts of the first two years of the pandemic, they lived in their car, spending nights in the store’s parking garage. Whatever White could spare went toward the occasional luxury of a motel room. Advertisement     “It wasn’t really often, but I would have to neglect certain bills, car note, just to be able to shower and have somewhere to lay down,” said White, who is 35 and has been a cashier at Ralphs branches in Los Angeles and Riverside, among the 2,800 grocery stores Kroger owns across the country under around 20 brand names. “Once they took the hazard pay, and they started cutting hours again, it was really bad.”The pandemic brought renewed attention to the conditions of hourly laborers who keep America fed, and has led to wage increases in some sectors for the first time in years. Yet while the vaccine rollout reduced the risk of becoming severely ill from an on-the-job COVID infection for many essential workers, it also led to a rollback of company policies and government programs that helped them make ends meet in the early months of the crisis. As a result, many remain in financial circumstances every bit as precarious as they were before the pandemic began.In a survey of around 36,000 Kroger hourly workers in Colorado, Washington, and California, commissioned by their local United Food and Commercial unions and released this week, 42% of respondents said they relied on borrowing money from friends or family to pay for basic needs over the last year, 34% said they cut portion sizes or skipped meals because they couldn't afford food, and 14% said they were unhoused.Kroger, the country’s largest grocery chain, ended its $2-an-hour hazard pay raise two months into the pandemic. Last year, as government stimulus payments dried up and rent moratoriums expired, Kroger opted to close stores in at least three cities that passed laws ordering hazard pay raises at groceries, shutting down three supermarkets in Los Angeles, two in Seattle, and two in Long Beach, where, in a statement at the time, Kroger cited “the economic cost mandated” by the local ordinance increasing wages by $4 an hour. Advertisement     Kroger declined to comment on specific claims in this story.“As America’s grocer, we have balanced significant wage investments for our associates while keeping food affordable for the communities we serve,” company spokesperson Kristal Howard said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Our longstanding culture of opportunity has created an environment where many people, whether it be a cashier, clerk, stocker, or pharmacy technician, come for a job and stay for a career. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities.”After ticking slightly upward from 2019 to 2020, Kroger’s annual revenue rose 8% in 2021, to $132 billion. Senior executives each made $5 million or more in 2020, with CEO Rodney McMullen earning $22 million, nearly double his 2018 pay.For the hourly workers inside the stores, current wage rates mean scrambling to pick up shifts, juggling bill deadlines, and finding alternative means to making ends meet, according to four Kroger workers from three states who spoke with BuzzFeed News. Even in states like California where local minimum wages are twice the federal rate, higher rent prices and other living costs mean that many workers receive paychecks that don’t cover the bills.Jeanne, a 58-year-old who has worked at Ralphs in a Southern California suburb for three years and asked that her last name be withheld for fear of losing her job, said that she collects cans on her 4-mile walk back from work, filling as many as 50 garbage bags a month to earn the extra $150 or so she needs to cover expenses, including $1,500 in rent for the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her teenage son. A neighbor buys them groceries every few weeks “just because she knew I was a single mom and I was working my tail off and I had no money,” Jeanne said. “If she didn’t leave me eggs and bread, my son and I would starve.” Advertisement     During the first year of the pandemic, Robin White said, she was often able to clock 40 hours on weeks when outbreaks knocked colleagues out of commission or resignations left shifts open, but once the stimulus payments ended, hiring increased and her hours dipped into the mid-20s for most of 2021.In recent weeks, the Omicron wave has opened more shifts for workers who aren’t out sick, while leaving them understaffed once again. In the second week of January, White said that half of the cashiers on her shift at the Riverside store were out with COVID. Janet Wainwright, a meat cutter and shop steward at a Kroger in Yorktown, Virginia, estimated that around a dozen of her coworkers had called in with positive tests.“We've had more people out than we've ever had since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wainwright said that week.Unlike during the first year of the pandemic, Kroger no longer informs workers when a colleague tests positive, nor maintains the cleaning protocols implemented early in the crisis, according to Wainwright, White, and Jeanne. Advertisement     “Those safety policies ended last year, in the spring, when things kinda leveled out,” Wainwright said. In the first year of the pandemic, “when somebody was sick, they sent in a cleaning crew at night to clean that department. That don’t happen no more.”Kroger did not respond to questions about its COVID safety protocols. In a statement, the company said that it required employees to wear masks and offered a $100 bonus to workers who get vaccinated. “Additionally, we created and amended several workplace policies at the onset of the pandemic to support our associates during immense uncertainty,” company spokesperson Howard said. “The safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.”While Congress passed a law early in the pandemic requiring two weeks of federally funded paid leave for workers showing COVID symptoms or caring for a person who tested positive, it didn’t apply to companies with at least 500 employees, and a BuzzFeed News investigation in April 2020 reported that at least 24 major retail and food companies, including Kroger, maintained sick leave policies less generous than what the government established for smaller businesses.Kroger now grants paid sick leave to vaccinated employees who test positive and offers free at-home tests to workers who show symptoms. As a Thanksgiving bonus, the company gave hourly workers $100 in-store credit and 1,000 fuel points, which amounts to $1 off per gallon of gas. Since the start of the pandemic, the company has given out $1,200 in bonuses to each part-time hourly worker and $1,760 to each full-time hourly worker “to reward and recognize them for their efforts,” Kroger spokesperson Howard said in a statement.Jeanne said she had once made $40 an hour at the insurance company where she’d worked for 27 years. After the father of her two children died unexpectedly in 2008, she quit the job to grieve and look after her children, who were 5 and 11 at the time. Advertisement     “We were going through a healing process,” she said.When she returned to the job market, the recession left her with fewer options. She worked as a caregiver for older adults for a while, before eventually getting hired at Ralphs.“I’m very thankful,” Jeanne said. “Trying to find a job at my age, it’s not easy.”White had been a security guard, a job she found “too dangerous,” before applying to Ralphs, a job that “fits the person I am,” she said. “I’m loving. I’m a nurturer. I love food. I love what I do. My Lord and savior has kept me safe to feed these people.”But she wished her job paid her enough “just to be comfortable,” she said. “Just to have a home and pay my bills and not have to struggle to do that.”Like Jeanne, White has needed the generosity of others to patch holes in the country’s safety net that left her unable to pay for basic needs. Recently, she and her son moved in with her cousin, who has a spare room for the foster children she provides temporary housing for. When kids cycle into the home, White sleeps on the floor.“In the struggle you have no choice but to make it work, just making the best decisions for what’s most important at that time,” she said. “Saving money. Instead of fast food, ramen and sandwiches. Can’t go out and party, no alcoholic beverages — whoever you were before, you can’t do none of those things.”White said has tried to shield her son from the impact of the challenges. During the months they lived in their car, she framed the experience as an adventure. Advertisement     “As a mom, you have to kinda like make it fun for the kid because the kid don’t really understand,” she said. “In his head, he’s like, ‘Mom, this is fun, I wanna go back.’ He didn’t know what was really going on.”On his last report card, she said, he had all A’s and B’s, and his teacher told her his reading skills were at the top of his class. By the time he is old enough for college, she said, she hopes to have enough saved up to cover the costs.

316,Here’s what the bride made of the risqué wedding look which left the internet divided…,"


LOS ANGELES — The chants outside the downtown Los Angeles courthouse were familiar, but this time they weren't talking about Britney Spears.""Free Nichelle Nichols!""""Isolation is abuse!""""Hey hey, ho ho, the conservatorship has got to go!""On Monday afternoon, a group of just over a dozen #FreeBritney supporters and fans of Nichelle Nichols, who became a Star Trek legend for her portrayal of Nyota Uhura, marched around Stanley Mosk Courthouse to raise awareness about the 89-year-old actor's situation. Since 2018, Nichols has been living under what they believe is another abusive conservatorship that has allowed her son, Kyle Johnson, to take control of her life and finances and decide who she sees and where she lives. Advertisement     ""We're going to do whatever we can to shed light on the issue and to make sure that there's lasting change for not just Britney, not just Nichelle but everyone who is trapped in this corrupt system,"" #FreeBritneyLA organizer Kevin Wu told BuzzFeed News.
 


Known for her trailblazing role as Lt. Uhura in the original series that first aired in the 1960s, Nichols is now living with dementia, a condition that has made her susceptible to exploitation, Johnson claimed in his original petition to place her under the court's supervision. But her longtime friend Angelique Fawcette, a producer and actor, has argued that Nichols was and is able to manage her affairs with help from an assistant and that Johnson is not acting in her best interests.Instead, Fawcette says Johnson moved his mother out of her Woodland Hills home to New Mexico against her will, sold her property against her wishes, and isolated her from her friends. She points to a troubling 2019 recording of Nichols screaming at Johnson to get his hands off of her and a deposition from a former conservator who raised concerns about him having control as proof that he is unfit to take care of his mother. ""You're trying to get rid of me,"" Nichols cries at her son in the recording. Advertisement     ""You just can't come and take people’s home and money and just say, 'Hey, it's mine. Sorry, you're old, you're almost dead anyway, so I'm taking this,'"" Fawcette told BuzzFeed News. ""Look at all these amazing old people who are out there doing things. They’re living the life 'til their last drop and that's really what I'm fighting for, for Nichelle.""BuzzFeed News uncovered abuse, neglect, and death across the US guardianship industry. Read our investigative series ""Beyond Britney"" here.During a hearing on Monday, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge overruled Fawcette's objections to Johnson's final accounting report for his mother's conservatorship, which is now under the jurisdiction of a New Mexico court, finding that she did not have standing to lodge her complaints and that they did not pertain to any specific line items in the report.
 


Fawcette and her attorney Matthew Taylor tried to argue that Johnson failed to declare Nichols' home and neighboring property as assets of the conservatorship estate and provide the necessary evidence required by state statute to sell the properties. They also alleged that Johnson may be misappropriating his mother's assets and asked for time to conduct discovery to investigate their concerns. Advertisement     His attorney, Jeffrey Marvan, argued that the objection regarding Nichols' home, which was sold after the conservatorship was moved out of California, should instead be raised in New Mexico, and said Johnson acted appropriately.""He’s the only son and child,"" Marvan told the court via videoconference. ""The conservatee’s family supports everything that my client is doing.""
 


Johnson's attorney did not respond to BuzzFeed News' request for comment Monday.Speaking to supporters outside the courthouse, Fawcette vowed to continue fighting for her friend.""I'd be damned if this is my last stand for Nichelle Nichols,"" she said. ""Whether you are white, Black, Latino, Asian, American Indian, Persian, no matter what you are, you have roots in the soil. And you have a right to stand up for yourself and you have a right to stand up for your family and your friends.""Dressed in a replica red Star Trek shirt like the one Nichols wore in the sci-fi show, Alexa Justo wiped her eyes as Fawcette spoke. The 26-year-old grew up worshipping Nichols as Lt. Uhura. Advertisement     ""She was definitely one of the only people I could look up to as a kid,"" said Justo, who is Black and Latina. ""She made it cool to be smart. She made it cool to be strong and obviously the whole being a woman of color — it’s not just for me personally but for the world, in general, her being one of the only characters that wasn’t like a slave or a maid. That means a lot.""Justo said she didn't think it was fair for Nichols to be placed in conservatorship, a system in which people lose basic rights and are exposed to, as a BuzzFeed News investigation found, abuse, exploitation, and even death.""Whether you’re emotionally invested or not, you should give a shit,"" Justo said. ""And Nichelle’s awesome, so you should give a shit about her. ""

The Bronx apartment building where a fire killed 17 people Sunday had a history of serious violations related to heat, ventilation, and other safety issues, some of which were still unresolved when officials say a malfunctioning space heater sparked one of the deadliest blazes in the city’s history.The Twin Parks North West apartment building, built in 1972 in the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, was home to dozens of families with low incomes, many of them immigrants. The 120-unit brick building had no fire escapes and outdated stairways, making it difficult for residents to flee the thick smoke that quickly enveloped their halls and homes largely in part to a door that did not close when it should have. The victims suffered from severe smoke inhalation, Daniel A. Nigro, the city’s fire commissioner, said, acknowledging that the death toll, which includes eight children, will likely rise as “there are many people fighting for their lives in the hospital.” Advertisement     This is the second time in just a week that residents in public housing died after a fire tore through their homes. Last Wednesday, flames swept through a crowded federally subsidized rowhouse in Philadelphia, killing 12 people, eight of them children.In the years and months before the Bronx blaze, tenants of the public housing complex had repeatedly reported that their apartments had no heat, faulty radiators, and broken ventilation systems, data shows.Bronx Park Phase III Preservation LLC, which owns the building and other affordable housing complexes, said it was fully cooperating with the investigation and helping assist residents.“We are devastated by the unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy,” the company said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.” Advertisement     Violations filed with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) show that some automatic self-closing doors, which are required in all buildings with three or more apartments and help slow a fire's spread, did not work in 2017 and 2019.The fire commissioner said Monday that when a family fled the fire on the second and third floor, their front door did not shut, which would have thwarted the spread of smoke. Another door on the 15th floor also malfunctioned and stayed open. Records show that the residents of the unit where the fire started had filed a ticket for a malfunctioning self-closing door in the past.An HPD spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the department fixed those complaints in 2020, adding that issues pertaining to self-closing doors “were reinspected and all were observed corrected by HPD Inspectors by August 2020.” Last fiscal year, the department said it had issued more than 22,000 self-closing door violations and ultimately resolved 18,000.“Yesterday's fire was a devastating tragedy, and our hearts go out to all the families affected by the worst kind of loss,” HPD said. “We urge residents to report malfunctioning doors to property owners or call 311 if issues are not corrected and HPD will respond.”
 


Though property owners say the building was up to code, residents have said their doors did not close automatically.In October, someone on the 12th floor reported “broken or defective fire retardant material” in public parts of the building. That is a C-class violation, which means it’s “immediately hazardous.” Then on April 11, that same resident filed a request to repair “the broken or defective mechanical ventilation system” in the apartment. That ticket was still open at the time of the fire. Ten days earlier, another tenant filed a B-class violation, meaning “hazardous,” for an additional report of “broken or defective fire retardant material” on the first floor. That request is also still open, according to records. Other complaints from December and November flagged exposed electrical wiring in the lobby, broken radiators, and defective doors.In 2021, residents of the Twin Parks North West filed more than 30 complaints that detailed dangerous and poor living conditions. In addition to the filings about ventilation and fire retardant material, other “immediately hazardous” requests from tenants that remain open describe lead paint in their bathrooms and hallways, roach infestations in kitchen walls, and mice crawling throughout their entire apartments.One unit, 6K, made 10 different complaints last month alone, including “no heat,” roaches in the entire apartment, a front door that does not self-close, a broken radiator in the living room, a damaged pipe in the bathroom, and no heat. Most of these filings were marked as resolved before the blaze, according to records. Advertisement     Residents also had problems with their heat. Several reports dating back to December 2020, all of which have been marked as closed, describe apartments that had no heat. Officials say a space heater that had been running for a few days malfunctioned and sparked the fire, which New York housing advocates say signals that the heat was inadequate for the frigid temperatures that hit the borough last week.“The stories we have heard about inadequate heating in places like this are a broken record, and landlords are not held accountable,” Edward Garcia, the director of community development for the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a racial and economic justice organization, told BuzzFeed News. “People do what they need to do to stay safe. Being in a really cold apartment triggers health issues like asthma, and the Bronx has some of the worst health outcomes in the state.”On Monday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams reiterated that the building had ""no outstanding violations"" for complaints related to lack of heat. But in an interview with Good Morning America, he also acknowledged that there “may have been a maintenance issue” with the apartment door where the fire started.
 


The Twin Parks North West is part of a public housing portfolio recently acquired and managed by a group of wealthy, high-profile investors, emblematic of a housing market trend where real estate conglomerates have been buying lower-income housing buildings. As JustFix.nyc notes, Reliant Realty Services, which is listed as the managing agent of the Bronx complex, is connected to 123 other New York City buildings, most of which are in lower-income neighborhoods.At the end of 2019, a group of real estate companies purchased the Twin Parks North West, along with other affordable housing units in the Bronx, as part of a $170 million deal, the Real Deal reported at the time. The LIHC Investment Group is officially known in city records as Bronx Park Phase III Preservation, and includes several high-profile investors, such as Camber Property Group. Camber has been scooping up affordable housing complexes and runs a spate of units across New York City, mostly in the Bronx. Its cofounder, Rick Gropper, is listed as the landlord for the Twin Parks complex and also happens to be named as a member of the mayor’s transition team for housing issues.In press releases and articles announcing the purchase of the eight Bronx buildings, the coalition of new property owners said they planned ""to make operational improvements"" and preserve the 1,275 units as affordable housing. According to state filings, the building has not had any applications for renovations since 2015 for plumbing.Gropper is listed as the landlord for 43 of the 123 buildings in the portfolio, according to a database by JustFix.nyc. Eugene Schneur, the co-founder of another real estate firm called Omni New York, runs the rest. According to records, tenants in these buildings have made 29,266 complaints, 12,203 of which were in the past three years. Advertisement     The buildings, however, do have a better average of closed complaints compared to the rest of the city (an average of 0.3 open HPD violations per unit vs the city's average of 0.8 per unit). The most common issue for residents is heat and hot water, the database notes.

WASHINGTON — Donald Trump cannot be sued for pretty much anything he said while he was in the White House, including his speech on Jan. 6 that preceded the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters and his tweets throughout the day, a lawyer for the former president argued in court on Monday.Less than a week after the one-year anniversary of the Capitol riot, a federal judge in Washington, DC, considered the fate of three civil lawsuits seeking to hold Trump and his allies responsible for the attack — specifically, conspiring to interfere with Congress’s certification of the 2020 election results and incite violence against police officers who tried to protect the Capitol complex. Advertisement     US District Judge Amit Mehta asked questions that suggested he was at a minimum skeptical of Trump’s sweeping argument that he was immune against being sued for nearly anything he’d said during his four years as president. But Mehta also said during the hearing that he was struggling with whether the core conspiracy claim could go forward based on the facts laid out in the lawsuits, and whether comments by Trump and some of his other high-profile supporters on Jan. 6 were covered by the First Amendment’s free speech protections.It was the second time in just over a month that a court considered the argument that Trump couldn’t personally be sued over things he said while he was president. In early December, a federal appeals court in New York weighed efforts by Trump, backed by the Justice Department, to have the US government take over his defense against a defamation lawsuit filed by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A lower court judge had rebuffed the argument that Trump was acting within the scope of his official duties when he said Carroll was lying after she accused him of raping her more than two decades ago. The appeals court has yet to rule.Trump isn’t trying to involve the Justice Department in his defense against the growing number of lawsuits seeking to hold him responsible for the events of Jan. 6. He’s broadly arguing that he’s protected by a legal doctrine that shields sitting presidents from being sued over actions they take as part of the job. Arguments on Monday focused on three of the cases: one brought by a group of congressional Democrats, one brought by Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, and one brought by two US Capitol Police officers.A ruling from Mehta won't end the legal wrangling over Trump’s civil liability for the insurrection. If Trump fails to convince Mehta to toss these first three cases, he could ask an appeals court and potentially the US Supreme Court to intervene. If Trump succeeds at this stage, the plaintiffs could appeal. And there are four other civil lawsuits pending that accuse Trump of inciting the violence, plus one filed before Jan. 6 that accuses Trump of conspiring with the Republican National Committee to violate the rights of Black voters by trying to undermine the results of the election. Advertisement     Trump’s lead attorney, Jesse Binnall — a Virginia-based lawyer representing Trump in an array of postpresidency legal fights, and who counts Trump ally Michael Flynn as a former client and conservative attorney and activist Sidney Powell as a former co-counsel — argued Monday that presidential immunity extended to the “outer perimeters” of a president’s actions while in office.Mehta asked if Binnall wanted the judge to ignore the content of what Trump said on Jan. 6. Binnall replied yes, explaining that what mattered for immunity was the type of act at issue, which in this case was a speech to the American people, something that is part of being president.Mehta pushed back, pointing out that the lawsuits alleged that Trump had appeared at the Jan. 6 rally to advance his personal interests as a candidate for office. The judge asked Binnall why that wouldn’t place Trump outside the immunity that’s meant to protect a president against being sued for actions that were part of their official duties. Binnall argued that there was too much overlap between a president’s duties and political motivations to try to draw a clear line. Even if campaign activities weren’t covered by the immunity, Binnall said, Trump’s speech on Jan. 6 was not part of his campaign.The judge then asked about reports that Trump had contacted Georgia’s top election official to ask him to “find” votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s win in the state. Mehta asked Binnall if presidential immunity would apply to that type of phone call. Binnall said it would because a president had a constitutional duty to ensure laws were faithfully executed. When the judge noted that part of the Constitution didn’t apply to state laws, Binnall said that when it came to federal elections, state and federal functions merged. Advertisement     Mehta asked if a president would get immunity if they made defamatory statements at a campaign rally. Binnall said yes.The judge then asked if there was anything a president could say while they were in office that they could be sued for. Binnall said he’d tried to think of examples and could not.On the substance of the lawsuits, Mehta said that the plaintiffs had alleged a “very unusual” and “problematic” conspiracy. Taken together, the cases accused Trump of conspiring with high-profile allies like Rudy Giuliani as well as extremist groups whose members are being criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol. The judge noted that the lawsuits didn’t feature the kind of direct communication among co-conspirators that would normally be part of a case like this. He expressed concern that it would be “dangerous” to build a conspiracy case off of reactions to political speech.Joseph Sellers, an attorney for the congressional Democrats suing Trump who argued on behalf of all three sets of plaintiffs on Monday, maintained that the lawsuits did lay out facts that alleged a “meeting of the minds,” and not just a one-sided reaction to Trump’s speech. He said that Trump’s supporters engaged with his social media posts leading up to Jan. 6 about coming to Washington, that Trump urged the crowd to go to the Capitol even as people yelled out about storming and invading the building, and that Trump failed to immediately try to stop the riot, which could be seen as proof that he endorsed the mob.Sellers said that the law didn’t require them to show direct communication among all of the defendants, and he pointed out that they had presented facts that alleged coordination between two right-wing groups named in one of the cases, the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. Mehta acknowledged that was true, but noted that the plaintiffs would likely be disappointed if he allowed the conspiracy claims against those groups to go forward but dismissed them against Trump. Advertisement     Mehta is deeply familiar with the Justice Department’s theories so far on the role that members of the Oath Keepers played on Jan. 6. He’s presiding over a large conspiracy case that prosecutors have brought against members of the group; charges are pending against 17 defendants, and four defendants have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the government. The Oath Keepers have a pending motion to dismiss the Democrats’ civil lawsuit they’re named in, and Mehta is considering that as well.During an exchange with Binnall about the future of the conspiracy claim against Trump, Mehta asked about the fact that Trump didn’t tweet or put out other public statements telling the mob to stop immediately after the attack had begun. Binnall said that a president couldn’t be liable for not taking a certain action. The judge countered that Trump’s public silence could support the idea that Trump understood he was part of an agreement to disrupt Congress’s activities on Jan. 6. Mehta also drew a comparison to a civil lawsuit against organizers of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that turned violent; a jury last year found white nationalist Richard Spencer and others liable for conspiring to incite racially motivated violence.Mehta on Monday also considered whether claims lodged against Donald Trump Jr. and Giuliani, who were named as defendants in Swalwell’s case, could go forward. Mehta suggested there wasn’t as much of a record of Trump Jr. making public calls to action to the same extent as his father, and referenced public reports that Trump Jr. had messaged Trump’s chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, to try to get Trump to stop the mob.Near the end of the hearing, Mehta heard arguments on defendant Republican Rep. Mo Brooks’ effort to have the US government step into the case on his behalf, based on the argument that he was acting in his official capacity when he spoke at the Jan. 6 rally. The Justice Department has opposed stepping in on his behalf. Advertisement

A cadre of prominent voting rights organizations working on the ground in Georgia is boycotting President Joe Biden’s voting rights speech in the state Tuesday, protesting the slow progress on two landmark bills that have stalled in the Senate.“What we're saying is we don't need another speech. What we need is actually a plan,” said Cliff Albright, executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, on a call with reporters. “What we need is for him to lean into the filibuster and do what he has not yet done, which is give a clear call for it to be modified, not just telling us what he's open to, and not just telling us when he could possibly support if it's necessary, but to have a full-throated call for changing the filibuster in order to pass voting rights.” Advertisement     Biden plans to travel to Georgia with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, where both are slated to give speeches on the importance of voting rights legislation. There’s been little movement on Capitol Hill — despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's call for the Senate to vote on measures that would lay the groundwork to pass the voting rights legislation before Jan. 17.“​​There is not time during these fights to attend a speech and meet to reiterate the seriousness of this moment,” the groups said in a statement a day before Biden and Harris's trip to Georgia. The statement was signed by the New Georgia Project Action Fund, the Black Voters Matter Action Fund, the Asian American Advocacy Fund, the GALEO Impact Fund, and James Woodall, the former president of the Georgia NAACP.Asked about the groups’ calls for Biden to stay in DC and work on passing legislation rather than traveling to Georgia for the speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that the president would prefer to pass voting rights legislation with the support of a majority of the Senate.“His plan is to sign voting rights legislation into law,” Psaki told reporters during a Monday press briefing. “That requires a majority of senators to support it even if there are changes to the Senate rules, which is something the president has expressed an openness to.” Advertisement     The voting rights groups’ announcement to skip the president’s speech comes as they have grown frustrated that Senate procedure has stalled the bills. Senate Democrats support both bills but face a steep hurdle in the evenly divided chamber, where it takes 60 votes to pass legislation. Democrats have called for reforms to the procedure, which would require 51 votes, but Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have each voiced opposition to any carve-outs on the procedure.“It was very telling to us that this wasn't item number one on the agenda as soon as the president was inaugurated,” said Kendra Davenport Cotton, chief operating officer of the New Georgia Project.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell aggressively used the filibuster to kill legislation during the Obama and Trump administrations and has consistently warned Democrats against changing the rules.At the same time, 19 restrictive voting laws were passed in 2021 by Republicans on the state and local levels across the country, propelled by conspiracy theories denying the legitimacy of Biden’s win. In the past year, Georgia Republicans have passed several of those restrictive bills; the legislation at stake in the Senate would prevent those bills from taking effect, requiring states not to impose unreasonable voter ID and access laws and implementing national standards for how elections are run.“We think it sets a serious precedent that at the end of the day, when there are people that are coming after your base of voters, right, and you're stringing it out, and you're not reacting,” said LaTosha Brown, a Georgia-based advocate and cofounder of Black Voters Matter. Advertisement     She added, “How is it that now, myself, as a Black woman — I actually have less protection now than I did a year ago?”Biden previously called on the Senate to return to a rule that would require senators to continuously speak on the floor to delay a bill from passing. But advocates on the call said that the president needs to more forcefully back changing the filibuster rules.The two bills in question would significantly increase voter access in the US. The Freedom to Vote Act would standardize voter ID laws and permanently allow voting by mail, ban gerrymandering, and set national standards for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would reinforce portions of the Voting Rights Act, which was weakened by two Supreme Court decisions in the past decade, by specifically reinstating antidiscrimination protections for voters.Albright said the groups would only be satisfied if Biden and Harris arrive in Georgia tomorrow to announce an actual agreement on voting rights — with the backing of Sinema and Manchin. “Anything short of that would be disappointing and not worth the trip to Georgia,“ he said. “But the bare, bare minimum would be, as we have all said, a full-throated call for modifying the filibuster rules.”Some advocates want Biden to more firmly back Schumer’s call to hold a vote before Jan. 17 on carving out a voting rights exception to the filibuster. Advertisement     “We need Biden to demand that that vote happens this week,” Woodall said.He wants Biden to “call Manchin and Sinema out directly” for holding up the legislation.Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said she will attend the president's and vice president's speeches because she sees it as an opportunity to ground the push for the voting rights legislation in ""the cradle of the civil rights movement.""""I represent a district that was once held by Congressman John Lewis,"" she said. ""And I am going because it's imperative to me that the White House, specifically the president and the vice president, show that we have the full weight of the White House behind creating a path forward with the filibuster to get voting rights passed.""One major national civil rights group, the NAACP, did not join the local groups’ denunciation of the president’s visit — rather, its members will be watching closely in the days after the address for the president to push changes to the filibuster and then the voting rights bills, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told BuzzFeed News.Johnson said he’s seen the administration “muscle through and pass” other legislation like COVID relief, the debt ceiling raise, the infrastructure bill, and unemployment tax.“Placing the priority on the policy issues isn't about words, it is about outcomes. And we have yet to have an outcome of voting rights protections over a year,” he said.He said he does understand Georgia civil rights groups not supporting Biden’s visit. “What they’re expressing is their frustration knowing how important this is,"" he said. “So as I’m listening intently tomorrow, I’ll be watching the following days.”As far as he’s concerned, though, “how to get there is irrelevant as long as they get there.”

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, marked her 40th birthday in style over the weekend with three new official portraits taken by Italian fashion photographer Paolo Roversi. Over her four decades, she's gone from a commoner to a member of the royal family — a massive change that we've decided to look back on in honor of her birthday.Catherine ""Kate"" Middleton was born on Jan. 9, 1982, to Carole Middleton, an airline steward, and Michael Middleton, a flight dispatcher. She met her future husband, Prince William, in 2001, when they both began their studies at St. Andrew's University in Scotland. The two became friends, and in their second year, Kate, William, and two other friends moved into an off-campus apartment together. They started dating in 2003 — reportedly after William was entranced by Kate modeling a revealing dress in a charity fashion show. Although they broke up in 2007, the two were soon back together and William proposed marriage in 2010. Their royal wedding on April 29, 2011, was watched by tens of millions of people around the world. William and Kate are now the parents of three children and preparing for their roles as the future Prince and Princess of Wales — and, eventually, king and queen consort.

The School for Good Mothers by Jessamine Chan (Simon & Schuster)In the near future, the government's surveillance system has turned its eyes on mothers, scrutinizing women's behavior with dire consequences for any and every mistake. When 39-year-old Chinese American mom Frida Liu has one very bad day, her 18-month-old Harriet is taken away to live with Frida's ex-husband and his annoying girlfriend. To win her custody rights back, Frida must pass a yearlong course on how to be a good mother. Forced to live in prison-like conditions, Frida is given a robot doll modeled after her daughter to practice her mothering skills on. If Frida speaks out about the school's conditions or even questions policies, her record will be permanently marked, and she won't be able to see her daughter again. This devastating dystopian novel presents an honest glimpse into the difficulties of parenthood while calling out the culture of policing parents.Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan (Harper Voyager; Jan. 11)This debut fantasy based on the Chinese myth of the moon goddess, Chang'e, is as beautiful as its cover. When Chang'e becomes pregnant and the healers predict that neither she nor the baby will survive, she takes her husband's elixir of immortality, given to him by the celestials for shooting down the sunbirds setting fire to the land. However, saving her and her daughter's life has a cruel cost — the celestials exile her to the moon for taking her husband’s elixir, ensuring that she can never leave and never see her husband again. She keeps her daughter, Xingyin, a secret from the celestials. Xingyin grows up suppressing her magic so the celestials won't notice her, but she's forced to flee her moon home when the celestials catch on that something isn't quite right on the moon. At first, she works as a maid, but soon she wins a place as a companion to the Crown Prince of the celestials, and eventually she becomes famed for her archery skills and bravery. Her one goal in life is to free her mother and to see her again. This first book in a fantasy duology has everything a great fantasy needs: magic, action, romantic angst, nuanced characters, mythical creatures, moral dilemmas, and more. Advertisement     The Bone Spindle by Leslie Vedder (Razorbill; Jan. 11)The treasure hunters Fi and Shane could not be more different. Fi is measured and relies on her deep knowledge of archaeology and ancient history to find the best treasure. On the other hand, Shane relies on her luck and brawn to get her through scraps. While Shane would typically avoid teaming up with the droll Fi, she’s found a map she can’t decode, and Fi is the only one with the knowledge to help her find the map’s treasure. However, instead of finding treasure, the two find a curse that’s held Prince Briar Rose captive for centuries. This queer, gender-flipped YA retelling of Sleeping Beauty is an adventurous blast, and a great way to begin 2022 if you’re looking for a fun, lighthearted read.Ashes of Gold by J. Elle (Denene Millner Books; Jan. 11)The final book in the Wings of Ebony YA fantasy duology is as explosive as the first. This duology embodies Black girl magic, with cutting critiques of racism and how Black girls are treated in contemporary society combined with a powerful, no-nonsense magic-user protagonist, Rue. The second book provides more of a glimpse into the magical world of Ghizon, where Rue is determined to find a way to reclaim the magic stolen from her father’s people. Despite the supposedly ideal, fantasy setting, Rue finds many of the same inequalities in Ghizon as she did in Houston. Both books in this series are super fun and intense reads full of action and lots of twists that readers will have trouble putting down.How High We Go in the Dark by Sequoia Nagamatsu (William Morrow; Jan. 18)Written as a series of interconnected short stories, this searing literary dystopia makes for especially bleak reading in the midst of a pandemic. In the near future, climate change has caused severe melting of permafrost, releasing an ancient virus that quickly spreads. A culture of death develops, where theme parks are built to help children die while having fun and couture funeral homes cater to the wealthy. Scientists are also desperately trying to find ways of staving off death, growing human organs in pigs and building spaceships to find a better place to live. Each character is intimately drawn as they grapple with a future that gives very little freedom to hope or dream. The full cast audiobook is an excellent listen. It feels like an archive of personal stories about what the future may bring.Akata Woman by Nnedi Okorafor (Viking Books for Young Readers; Jan. 18)In the third book in the Nsibidi Scripts series, 15-year-old Sunny Nwazue is now a powerful Leopard Person.

Advertisement     The Beholden by Cassandra Rose Clarke (Erewhon; Jan. 18)This sweeping, rich standalone has lots of classic fantasy vibes.

Celestia asks the Lady to grant her a wealthy and kind husband to help the sisters’ farm thrive, but the Lady exacts a price. At some point in the future, she will require a favor of the sisters and the boat owner, and they must repay the debt, or else. Five years later, the kingdom is on the brink of war and disease is rampant, but Celestia and her sister Izara are thriving. Celestia is pregnant, and Izara is studying to be a mage. When the emperor calls Celestia’s husband away for a secret mention, the Lady of the Seraphine calls in her debt, and her demands put everything the sisters have worked toward at risk.Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi (Tordotcom; Jan. 25)This complex dystopia takes place 30 years into a future where Earth has been decimated by climate change. The wealthiest have fled and live in space colonies, leaving those without the means to escape struggling to find some kind of normalcy in a crumbling infrastructure and environment. Jonathan and David are white men who decide to leave their space colonies and return to Earth. As they begin to rebuild in New Haven, Connecticut, their white privilege is in sharp contrast to the Black existence in New Haven. While Jonathan and David idealize their return to Earth, the laborers Linc, Bishop, and Sydney — who salvage buildings for space colonies to use — are just trying to survive the radiation poisoning, street violence, gentrification, and the general inhumanity in how they’re forced to live. With interweaving timelines and characters, this is a dense read that, like the best dystopias, critiques current political and social problems.Light Years from Home by Mike Chen (Mira; Jan. 25)Rich in character development, this literary science fiction centers on family drama in the wake of an alien abduction. Fifteen years ago, aliens took Jakob to become part of their military fleet, and his disappearance left his family in ruins.

When a group tries to leave the center, one of them is shot out of fear that they might be contagious. The defiant Grace is appointed as de facto leader of the center, while Leah, nonverbal and autistic, takes over food distribution after her twin sister is the first to come down with the plague. Emerson, a nonbinary violinist kicked out of their home by their strict Catholic parents, takes up the responsibility of burying the dead.

323,"The Bronx fire comes just days after a fire at a Philadelphia apartment building that killed 12 people, eight of whom were children.","


Robert Durst, the multimillionaire who was the focus of the HBO documentary The Jinx and who was found guilty of murdering his friend, died on Monday at a hospital in California, his attorney said. He was 78 years old.Durst died at a hospital near Stockton where he had reportedly been taken for testing. In a statement, one of Durst's trial lawyers, Chip Lewis, said his death was associated with his ongoing health problems. Advertisement     ""We understand that his death was due to natural causes associated with the litany of medical issues we had repeatedly reported to the court over the last couple of years,"" he said.The New York Times reported that during his visit, he went into cardiac arrest and doctors were unable to revive him. In a statement, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said Durst died of natural causes at 6:44 a.m. while being treated at an outside hospital. The San Joaquin County coroner will determine an exact cause of death.Durst, who was sentenced on Oct. 14 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, gained renewed notoriety in 2015 after seeming to confess to three murders that he’d been suspected of for years. His “confession” was made on The Jinx via a hot mic while in the bathroom after an incriminating interview for the show’s explosive finale.In the documentary, Durst is heard saying, “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.” But it was later revealed that filmmaker Andrew Jarecki had manipulated the line; “Killed them all, of course” actually preceded Durst saying, “What the hell did I do?” with several muttered remarks between them.Still, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on March 14, 2015, the day before the finale aired on HBO.
 


By the time the case reached trial, decades after Berman’s death and years after The Jinx, Durst was frail and in poor health. The pandemic then delayed the trial further, shutting down proceedings just days after opening arguments. Durst missed the reading of the verdict because of possible COVID exposure. He returned to court for sentencing only to test positive a day later for COVID himself. His attorney told the LA Times he had been placed on a ventilator.As late as justice came in Berman’s murder, Durst never faced consequences in the death that prosecutors alleged started it all. In making their case that Durst murdered Berman, prosecutors argued that he believed she was going to implicate him to police in the killing of his first wife, Kathleen “Kathie” McCormack Durst, in 1982. By finding Durst guilty of the special circumstances of killing a witness, the jury signaled that they believed prosecutors’ arguments that Durst had also killed Kathie Durst, whose body has never been found.
 


Though Durst had not yet been charged in Kathie Durst's disappearance or death, much of the Berman trial had focused on her case. In their victim impact statements, Berman's family pleaded with Durst to tell the McCormack family where they could find her body.“In telling where Kathie is,” said Sareb Kaufman, who was raised by Berman, “you can find some small redemption.”Durst never did. And in November, prosecutors in New York indicted him for murder in connection with Kathie Durst's disappearance.Durst was born in New York on April 12, 1943, the eldest son of real estate magnate Seymour Durst and Bernice Herstein. His mother died at age 32, after reportedly jumping from the roof of the three-story family home in Scarsdale. Durst, then 7 years old, would later claim he had seen his mother jump that night, an account that has been disputed by his family.After graduating from Lehigh University in 1965 with a degree in economics, Durst attended UCLA. There he met Berman; their friendship lasted decades, until he killed her in 2000.In 1973, Durst married Kathie Durst, who would go on to disappear in January 1982, when she was a fourth-year medical student at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Days after she was last seen alive, a woman claiming to be Kathie Durst called in sick to the dean of the school — a call that LA prosecutors said was made by Berman to cover for her friend. Durst did not report his wife missing for nearly a week.Although Durst was never charged, suspicion followed him for decades. In 1999, police in Westchester, New York, reopened the case.Feeling the pressure of a renewed investigation, in April 2001, Durst moved to Galveston, Texas, where he lived in a boarding house in disguise as a woman. On Sept. 30 of that year, the dismembered remains of his neighbor Morris Black washed up in Galveston Bay. Durst later admitted fatally shooting Black and chopping up his body, but he said the killing was the accidental result of a struggle over a gun. A Galveston jury found him not guilty based on his claims of self-defense.As he admitted on the witness stand in the recent trial, though, he couldn’t be trusted to tell the truth under oath.“I did not kill Susan Berman,” Durst said, which was a lie. “But if I had, I would lie about it.”

324,The Duchess of Cambridge’s life in 40 photos.,"Celebrities are mourning the loss of Bob Saget, who died yesterday. He was 65. On Sunday evening, the Orange County Sheriff's Office reported that Bob was found dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando. The cause of his death has not been confirmed, but officials said that there are no signs of foul play or drug use. “Earlier today, deputies were called to the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes for a call about an unresponsive man in a hotel room,” the officials wrote on Twitter. “The man was identified as Robert Saget and pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.” The legendary comedian and actor was perhaps best known for playing Danny Tanner on Full House in the '80s and '90s. He later reprised the role in 2016 for the show’s revival, Fuller House. Bob is survived by his wife, Kelly Rizzo, and three daughters — Aubrey, Lara, and Jennifer — who he shares with his first wife, Sherri Kramer. The comedian’s family issued a statement confirming the tragic news, spotlighting Bob's passion for performing live and “bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter.” “We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today. He was everything to us and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter,” Saget’s family wrote. “Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world.” The news came shortly after he performed to a live audience on Saturday night in Jacksonville as part of his stand-up comedy tour. Several hours before his death, Bob tweeted about how much he’d loved that night’s show. Fellow comic, Pete Davidson, led tributes to the Full House star in the wake of his death. In a very rare public statement, Pete — who does not have his own social media accounts — spoke of Bob’s “kindness” and opened up about how the actor had helped him through struggles with his mental health. Pete's statement — which was shared on the Instagram account of his friend and fellow comic Dave Sirus — began with the 28-year-old describing Bob as ""one of the nicest men on the planet."" “When I was younger and several times throughout our friendship [Bob] helped me get through some rough mental health stuff,” the Saturday Night Live star said. “He stayed on the phone with my mom for hours trying to help in anyway he can — connecting us with doctors and new things we can try. He would check in on me and make sure I was okay,” he wrote. The statement concluded: “I love you Bob it was an honor to know you. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. My condolences to the family.” Like Pete, many other comedians spoke of Bob’s kindness, including Jim Carrey who praised his “big, big heart and wonderfully warped comic mind” in a tribute on Twitter. Fellow comics like Judd Apatow, Jon Stewart, Billy Crystal, Tiffany Haddish, Kathy Griffin, Chelsea Handler, and Ken Jeong also mourned the loss of their friend and colleague. A number of Full House actors have spoken out in memory of their costar, including the notoriously private Olsen twins. In a statement provided to People, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen — who shared the role of Michelle Tanner, first appearing on the show as infants — said they are “deeply saddened” by the death of their TV dad. “Bob was the most loving, compassionate and generous man. We are deeply saddened that he is no longer with us but know that he will continue to be by our side to guide us as gracefully as he always has,” the former child stars wrote in a joint statement. “We are thinking of his daughters, wife and family and are sending our condolences,” they added. Elsewhere, John Stamos — who famously played Uncle Jesse on the sitcom — expressed his “complete and utter shock,” telling fans he feels “broken” by the loss of his former castmate. “I am broken. I am gutted,” the actor wrote on Twitter. “I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him. I love you so much Bobby.” Other Full House alumni like Dave Coulier and Candace Cameron Bure also shared tributes on Twitter. The latter — who played Bob’s eldest TV daughter, DJ Tanner — wrote that Bob was “one of the best human beings” she’d ever known. Despite Bob’s generation-spanning performances on Full House and Fuller House, he was better known to some for his essential role in How I Met Your Mother. Across all nine seasons of the hit sitcom, Bob lent his voice to the future version of Ted Mosby, who narrated each episode. Josh Radnor — who played Ted — shared a heartfelt thread of tweets to celebrate the life of the man who voiced his older self for nearly a decade. “We had a very special bond from Day 1, were never out of touch for long,” Josh wrote. “We found a way to grab dinner once a year, even after HIMYM wrapped. We went to see each other in our Broadway plays. We talked a lot about how to live a meaningful life amidst all the chaos.” He concluded the thread by expressing his gratitude for Bob’s friendship: “I’m endlessly grateful that HIMYM brought Bob Saget into my life. I’ll hear his voice in my head for the rest of my days.” Neil Patrick Harris — who played Barney Stinson on HIMYM — joined his costar in mourning the loss, describing Bob as “kind and generous and hilarious.” As well as those who worked with Bob on a professional basis, a number of his friends across the showbiz industry have penned moving tributes — including John Mayer, who was known to be an especially close friend to the actor. In a short but heartfelt statement on Instagram, John wrote: “I love you, Bob. I will never forget you. I will visit you often in my memories, and I hope I get to see you in my dreams. I will tell my kids about you. I’m taking you with me forever. I love you, Bob.” Other celebrities who've shown love for the beloved comedian include Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Martin, Andy Cohen, and BJ Novak."

Needless to say: Warning! There will be many spoilers for Spider-Man: No Way Home ahead!


 


If you didn’t know, the game Werewolf involves a group of people, some of whom are secret “werewolves” tasked with hiding their identity from the others. “Like anyone who’s played the game Werewolf knows, if you are the werewolf your heart kind of sinks because you know you have a stressful couple of hours ahead of you,” Andrew went on. “You’re gonna have to lie to your friends’ faces and try to convince them that you are not the bad guy in the game... But it was thrilling, actually.”
 


“I placed myself in that position of, ‘Well, what would I want to know? Would I want to be toyed with? Would I want to be lied to? Would I want to be kept on my toes guessing? Would I want to discover it when I went to the theater? Would I want to be guessing, guessing, guessing?’” he said. Advertisement     Refuting his own concerns, Andrew said: “I would want the actor to do an incredibly good job at convincing me he wasn’t in it. And then I would want to lose my mind in the theater when my instinct was proven right. That’s what I would want.”
 


“I worked so hard to keep it a secret that I was in Atlanta shooting,” he said. “All these leaks were happening, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, guys, what the hell is going on? I’m working so hard here to stay secret, and then here’s an image of me with Tobey!’ And they’re like, ‘No, no, we’re gonna keep it quiet.’ ‘OK, I’ll keep denying it.’
 


“It’s been a rare experience to play that mass game of Werewolf with every single Spider-Man fan in the world,” he concluded.
 


For context: In The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Andrew's Peter Parker failed to save his love interest Gwen Stacy, who dies after falling from the clock tower. In No Way Home, however, he manages to save MJ from a similar fall — something that he called “a second chance at saving Gwen.” Advertisement     
 


“It was joyful, and a feeling of closure for me. There was so many unanswered questions for my Peter, where we left it. I got to step back in and get some healing for him,” he said.

326,Convicted murderer Robert Durst has died at 78. The multimillionaire was the focus of The Jinx documentary.,"If Julia Fox wasn’t on your radar in 2021 then I’m pretty sure she is in 2022 thanks to her and Kanye West’s very public new romance, which she confirmed in a detailed blog post last week. Kanye — who legally changed his name to Ye last year — had spent the weeks prior to meeting Julia begging his ex-wife Kim Kardashian to take him back after she filed for divorce in February, following six years of marriage. But after his efforts proved fruitless, he moved on with Uncut Gems actor Julia over New Year — and if the revelation that Ye surprised her with a “hotel suite full of clothes” on their second date wasn’t intense enough, it has now transpired that Julia considers herself a “die-hard, OG” fan of the Kardashians and admitted just two weeks before meeting Ye that she wanted to be a part of the family. To recap, Ye first broke his silence on his and Kim’s split in November, where he insisted he’d “never seen the divorce papers” in an episode of the Drink Champs podcast. He continued to make a string of similar claims that suggested he and Kim would reunite, before publicly begging his ex to take him back live onstage at his and Drake’s ""Free Larry Hoover"" concert in December. Reworking the lyrics of his 2010 hit “Runaway,” Ye repeatedly sang: “I need you to run right back to me, baby,” before adding, “more specifically, Kimberly.” The very next day, on Dec. 10, Kim submitted a request to court to be declared “legally single,” citing that “no counseling or reconciliation effort” can fix their marriage, and that Ye had not responded to multiple requests to officially “terminate” the relationship. She is rumored to have moved on with Saturday Night Live comic Pete Davidson, whom she was first linked to in October and jetted to the Bahamas with last week. After Kim’s petition to be “legally single” was filed, Ye reportedly decided to start “embracing the single life” as he was spotted in the company of various different women over the holiday season. But only one of the beauties managed to stick, with Julia and Ye embarking on a whirlwind romance after they met in Miami on New Year’s Eve. On Jan. 6, Julia confirmed that they are officially dating in a blog entry for Interview magazine, which recounted their relationship so far alongside a slew of very intimate photographs of the new couple. Confirming that they’d first met less than one week earlier, Julia wrote: “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night.” She added that they’d then flown to New York to watch a play before going for dinner at her favorite restaurant, where Ye took it upon himself to direct a photo shoot, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines, she said. And when the pair returned to their hotel suite, Julia found that Ye had filled it with racks of new clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” But fans were quickly struck with an eerie sense of déjà vu, recalling that Ye used a similar tactic to reinvent Kim at the very start of their relationship. Once they officially started dating in 2012, Ye decided to give Kim’s wardrobe and style a complete overhaul — famously reducing her to tears as he threw away any items that he didn’t approve of and presented her with a pile of new designer clothes. And this is all information that Julia is most likely aware of, considering she is a hardcore fan of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, where Kim has frequently spoken about Ye's behavior. In fact, Julia discussed her obsession with Kim’s entire family on her Forbidden Fruits podcast on Dec. 18 — two weeks before her and Ye’s fateful first meeting. Julia revealed that she can remember the exact moment Kim and Ye announced their divorce earlier in the year, and enthusiastically asked her cohost Niki Takesh: “Can we talk about the Kim and Kanye divorce? Wait, can we talk about Kim and Pete Davidson, though?” She and Niki go on to call themselves “OG, die-hard Kardashian fans” as they discussed the E! show coming to an end in June last year, with Julia admitting: “I’m gonna miss Keeping Up. I’ve been watching Keeping Up since it first came out in 2007, like when watching it was embarrassing. I like, wanted them to be my family.” Niki went on to add: “No, they are my family — I’m the biggest Kardashian stan and have been since 2007, nothing can stop that. It’s not even like, Oh my god, I’m obsessed with them. I don’t know how to explain my obsession with them.” Julia shared her agreement before musing: “You feel like you know them. It’s a different relationship, a deeper one, it’s like you’re happy for them when something good happens.” The pair then discussed Khloé Kardashian’s romance with Tristan Thompson, with Julia calling her “sensitive and kind” after recalling: “I remember watching the last season and she wasn’t back with Tristan yet in public; she wanted another baby but doing it with his sperm and her eggs. It’s like, babe, it’s OK — your kids don’t need to have the same father. Go find some good fucking guy.” And Julia's self-proclaimed love for all things Kardashian could explain why she's been recently caught liking several of Kim's Instagram posts while dating Ye. Julia follows Ye's ex on the social media platform, and eagle-eyed fans spotted her name under the likes for many of Kim’s posts — most recently a photo of Kim walking out of a hotel, which she shared four days ago alongside the caption: “The best is yet to be.” And if things go well between her and Ye, then Julia might just get her wish of being a part of Kim’s family — or at least stepmom to her kids."

An accomplished comedian and actor, Saget was best known for his role as Danny Tanner in the sitcom Full House, which ran for eight seasons from 1987 to 1995. He also hosted America's Funniest Home Videos during the show's most iconic era, and he provided the voice for the ""future"" Ted Mosby on How I Met Your Mother. Even though Saget was associated with plenty of family-friendly media, he was equally known for his stand-up comedy, which mostly veered into adult-oriented territory. He also had a notorious cameo in the 1998 stoner comedy classic Half Baked. You can watch it below. Saget stayed in the public eye in the years leading up to his death — even appearing on The Masked Singer's fourth season, in which he competed as the ""Squiggly Monster."" At the time of his passing, Saget was on a stand-up tour that last stopped in Jacksonville, Florida.

At least 17 people, eight of them children, have died and dozens are hospitalized in critical condition following a ""horrific"" apartment-complex fire in the Bronx, New York City officials said.The fire was caused by a malfunctioning electric space heater in a residence that spanned two floors of the apartment complex, FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said in a press conference Sunday night. When those living in the apartment fled, they left the doors open, allowing smoke from the blaze to escape throughout the building. New York passed a law requiring large apartment buildings to have self-closing doors following an earlier deadly fire in the Bronx; it wasn't immediately clear how the door was able to remain open Sunday. Advertisement     ""The door to that apartment — unfortunately when the residents left — was left open; it did not close by itself,"" Nigro said. ""The smoke spread throughout the building, thus the tremendous loss of life and people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx.""He added that the fire was contained, and smoke alarms in the building were operable.Officials initially said 19 people had died, but revised the number to 17 in a Monday press conference.
 


The fire broke out in the 19-story Twin Parks apartment building on East 181st Street at approximately 11 a.m.It was classified as a five-alarm fire, the most serious and dangerous category of blazes. Nigro said that more than 200 firefighters responded to the scene within minutes of the fire being reported.In the immediate aftermath, the fire commissioner confirmed 63 injuries, 32 of which required hospitalization.""This fire took its toll on the city,"" he said
 


Nigro added that given the number of people with serious injuries, the blaze was ""unprecedented in our city."" Firefighters ""found victims on every floor"" in cardiac and respiratory distress due to smoke inhalation, he said. Advertisement     Newly elected Mayor Eric Adams described the fire as ""a horrific, horrific, painful moment.""""The impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of pain and despair in this city,” Adams told the press. “This is going to be one of the worst fires we have witnessed in the city of New York in modern times.”Adams said that individuals affected by the fire who request government aid will not be turned over to immigration officials, regardless of their residency status. He said that many of those who lived in the building are Muslim immigrants from Gambia.""If you need assistance, your names will not be turned over to ICE or any other institution. We want people to be comfortable in coming forward, and it's imperative that we connect with those on the ground to make sure they get that message and that word out,"" Adams said.Camber Property Group, the organization that owns the building, said in a statement to the New York Times that they were ""devastated"" by the ""unimaginable loss of life caused by this profound tragedy.""""We are cooperating fully with the Fire Department and other city agencies as they investigate its cause, and we are doing all we can to assist our residents. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured, and we are here to support them as we recover from this horrific fire.”The Bronx fire comes mere days after a fire at a Philadelphia apartment building that killed 12 people, eight of whom were children. The cause of that blaze remains under investigation, but the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that authorities believe a 5-year-old playing with a lighter set a Christmas tree on fire.BuzzFeed News reporter Kadia Goba contributed to this story.

The royal family on Sunday released three new official portraits of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (aka Kate Middleton), to mark her 40th birthday.The photos, taken by Italian fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, were captured in London's Kew Gardens in November 2020. The future queen consort is wearing custom-made gowns from British fashion house Alexander McQueen, which also designed her 2011 wedding dress. Advertisement     According to the BBC, the three portraits will at first go on display in locations across the UK ""with special meaning"" to the duchess before being permanently housed at the National Portrait Gallery, of which Kate is a patron. One image will hang in Berkshire, where the duchess was born and spent her childhood. The other will go to St. Andrews in Scotland, where Kate and William attended college and where they met. The third will go to Anglesey, where the royal couple lived immediately after their wedding.
 


Roversi, who is based in Paris, told the Guardian that working with Kate was a ""true honor"" and ""a moment of pure joy.""“I was moved by her warmth and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul, and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. Advertisement     “It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world.”Four other portraits by Roversi are already on display in the National Portrait Gallery.
 


The pictures — two monochrome and one in color — show Kate in both casual and formal poses. The Queen loaned the duchess a pair of diamond earrings for the color portrait; she wears earrings that belonged to her mother-in-law, Princess Diana, in the others.In a tweet Sunday, Kate thanked the photographer and the National Portrait Gallery for the images and expressed her appreciation for the birthday wishes.

A Chinese immigrant who was violently attacked months ago in New York City has died of his injuries, police said Saturday.Yao Pan Ma, 61, had been collecting bottles and cans in East Harlem on April 23, 2021, when a 49-year-old man ambushed him, knocking him to the ground and repeatedly kicking him in the head, leaving him bloodied and brutalized. In the months since, Ma had been in a coma and on a ventilator and was moved to hospice care in November, a spokesperson for his family previously told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     Shortly after the incident, Jarrod Powell, 49, was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault as a hate crime. During a deposition, Powell claimed a “Korean” man and a “Japanese” guy had robbed him, but “did not provide any details relating to the description of the perpetrators of the alleged robbery other than that they were Asian,” court records state.Following Ma's death on Dec. 31, the attack is being treated as a homicide, police said.Ma and his wife emigrated from China to the US in Nov. 18 and moved in with her parents in Harlem after losing their Chinatown apartment to a fire, the family's spokesperson said. Back in China, where the couple's children and grandchildren remained, Ma had been a talented chef. In New York, he got a job cooking and washing dishes at a restaurant in Chinatown, but lost it when the pandemic shuttered restaurants across the city.The family struggled to make ends meet after that; Ma did not qualify for unemployment benefits, and his in-laws received less than $1,000 in Social Security income. To support all four of them, Ma and his wife began collecting empty bottles and cans, living off the 5-cents-apiece refunds. Advertisement     After he was attacked while gathering the recyclables, Ma's wife was too afraid to go out and continue doing so. She found work as a home health aide for a time but is now unemployed again. During her visits to the hospital to see her husband, she would play Chinese opera music for him, uncertain but hopeful he might be able to hear it.Ma is one of the many victims in a wave of anti-Asian violence that has swept the US during the pandemic. Like him, a number of older Asian people, many of them immigrants, have been severely injured or even killed in similar unprovoked beatings. In March, six Asian women were killed in a string of shootings at spas in Georgia.According to a recent report by the organization Stop AAPI Hate, there have been more than 10,000 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in the US since March 2020, 16% of which were physical assaults.

The author of A Little Life returns with yet another doorstopper (To Paradise is a whopping 720 pages). Set in three alternative versions of the US, the novel focuses primarily on three characters, two of whom have the same name. The first section is a queer Edith Wharton–esque tale of a young man named David who agrees to an arranged marriage to an older man even though he’s in love with someone else. In the second section, a character also named David lives in 1993 Manhattan during the AIDS epidemic and cares for his ailing older partner while avoiding anything to do with his father and his family back in Hawaii. The third section centers on a woman trapped in a dystopian future, still reeling from the effects of a devastating pandemic. —T.O.

When her father dies of a stroke in China, she takes 48 hours off to attend the funeral and then is back to work. But a mandatory wellness break forces Joan to spend time with her mother and brother.

Son of Elsewhere is described as “memoir in pieces,” and indeed it gives gorgeous if sometimes brutal flashes from Abdelmahmoud’s life. Each essay covers a wide range — stories about Blackness, immigration, fatherhood, wrestling fanfiction, war, and the glory of suburban Canadian highways— but his writing always pulls you in and makes you stay, even if it’s painful, even if it hurts. —Scaachi Koul

334,The three new portraits of the Duchess of Cambridge will go on display around the UK and then hang in the National Portrait Gallery.,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019. Advertisement     I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends.“That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing. Advertisement     Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake. Advertisement     “It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

337,"brb, unfollowing everyone","Welcome to the next chapter of the Kimye divorce saga, starring Julia Fox. The 31-year-old actor — who is best known for her breakout performance in Adam Sandler’s Uncut Gems — appears to have bagged herself the highly coveted role of the newest muse of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West). If you’re wondering how we got here, you’re not alone. Allow me to explain. So, if you’ve been ~keeping up~ with Kim Kardashian West and Ye over the past few months, you’ll be well aware that Ye has made no secret of the fact that his sights have been firmly set on a reunion. While Kim was hanging out with her rumored beau, Pete Davidson, Ye pretty much spent the entire month of November publicly begging for her to reconsider their divorce. In fact, even as recently as Dec. 9, the father of four was proudly singing for his soon-to-be-ex-wife to “run right back” to him while performing on stage in front of 70,000 people. In light of this, fans were left understandably shocked after the rapper was spotted hanging out with a number of different women over the course of the festive period. Reportedly “embracing the single life,” Ye spent time partying in Belize, Houston, and eventually Miami, where he celebrated over the New Year weekend. Which is where we meet Julia Fox. The duo were first linked after they stepped out for dinner in Miami on New Year’s Day. And despite reports at the time that the date was “nothing serious,” Julia and Ye were spotted on a second outing just a few days later. After relocating to New York City for their next date — which involved a Broadway show and another romantic dinner — Page Six reported that the two were officially dating. And now, putting any speculation to rest, Julia confirmed the romance herself in a blog entry she wrote for Interview Magazine on Jan. 6 — less than one week after we’re told they first met. The brief but detailed article — which is accompanied by a slew of very intimate images of the two — begins with Julia explaining that, as we presumed, she and Ye first met in Miami on New Year’s Eve, right before their first date on Jan. 1. “I met Ye in Miami on New Year’s Eve and it was an instant connection. His energy is so fun to be around. He had me and my friends laughing, dancing, and smiling all night,” she wrote, before going on to explain how they wound up in NYC days later. “We decided to keep the energy going and fly back to New York City to see Slave Play,” she revealed. “Ye’s flight landed at six and the play was at seven and he was there ON TIME. I was impressed.” “After the play we chose to do dinner at Carbone which is one of my favorite restaurants. Obviously,” she added. Julia also explained that — in true Ye style — the Yeezy founder took it upon himself to direct a photoshoot inside the restaurant, snapping shots of Julia while other diners apparently cheered from the sidelines. “At the restaurant, Ye directed an entire photo shoot for me while people dined! The whole restaurant loved it and cheered us on while it was happening,” she said. And if the impromptu photoshoot wasn’t strange enough, here’s where things start to get a little weird. The Uncut Gems star went on to reveal that after finishing up with dinner, the two headed back to a hotel suite which had been packed out with racks of clothes for her to wear. “After dinner Ye had a surprise for me. I mean, I’m still in shock,” Julia wrote. “Ye had an entire hotel suite full of clothes. It was every girl’s dream come true. It felt like a real Cinderella moment.” “I don’t know how he did it, or how he got all of it there in time. But I was so surprised. Like, who does things like this on a second date? Or any date!” she concluded. If you read that passage and felt a sudden pang of déjà vu, that’s probably because we’ve seen this scenario before. Despite Julia’s evident surprise at the gesture, Ye used a similar tactic once before to woo (or rather, reinvent) Kim Kardashian at the start of their relationship. If you need reminding, Ye took it upon himself to lead a complete overhaul of Kim’s image shortly after they officially started dating in 2012. Starting with her style, Ye called upon the help of his stylist, who assisted him in updating Kim’s entire closet, disposing of anything they didn’t like and replacing it with ~Ye-approved~ items. After reportedly throwing out over 250 pairs of shoes — and reducing Kim to tears in the process — Ye presented her with an entirely new wardrobe filled with designer clothes he’d picked out to inaugurate the new-and-improved Kim. Nearly a decade later — the 250 pairs of lost shoes now ancient history — and Ye has literally been credited with “revolutionizing” Kim’s style and overall image. Which prompts the question: Is history about to repeat itself? Interestingly, even before Julia revealed that he had surprised her with the new clothes, some fans were already speculating that Ye had been styling her for their dates. Sporting a number of Balenciaga ensembles, Julia’s date night attire was suspiciously reminiscent of the countless looks from the same designer that we’ve come to expect from Kim over recent months. Clearly unfazed by the Kim K comparisons, Julia closed out her Interview Mag post by hinting that she’s excited for the future of her relationship with Ye. “Everything with us has been so organic,” she told readers. “I don’t know where things are headed but if this is any indication of the future I’m loving the ride.” Like Julia, we also can’t predict where the future will take this unlikely duo. But, if Ye's generous wardrobe donation is anything to go by, there's a chance he could be in it for the long run."

339,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"


People are posting on social media that they’re getting positive COVID results after swabbing their throat for an at-home rapid test rather than doing the recommended nasal swab.In a TikTok with more than a million views, a reporter demonstrated that when she swabbed her nose for an at-home rapid COVID-19 antigen test, the result was negative. Advertisement     But when Alison Hall swabbed her throat minutes later and did the same kind of test, it came back positive. She also later confirmed a positive result with a PCR test.“Moral of the story — consider swabbing your throat in addition to your nose for early detection and get a backup PCR test to confirm,” she says in the video.#SwabYourThroat also trended on Twitter, as multiple people posted about testing positive to COVID with a throat swab after negative nasal swabs. Manufacturers recommend nasal swabs, however, and all the data on how well the tests work are based on using it as instructed. As Omicron sends the world to record levels of COVID infections, and long testing lines make it harder to get PCR tests, people are often relying on at-home rapid tests to see if they’re infected. A sore throat is a trademark Omicron symptom and many people report it being their first indication of having the virus.But experts don’t endorse throat swabbing — even if some of them are doing it themselves on their own home tests. For one, the FDA does not recommend using tests incorrectly. Advertisement     Nam Tran, an associate clinical professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine who oversees COVID-19 testing efforts at UC Davis Health, told BuzzFeed News that he does not recommend swabbing the throat because a lot of things could affect it, such as food in the throat. Even drinking something beforehand could cause the virus to wash down and not appear on the test.He acknowledged that it was possible a throat swab result may come back positive earlier. Rapid tests are more likely to give a false negative early on, which may be why people want to swab their throat.“There’s a biological factor, meaning the virus may replicate more early on in the throat and expand thereafter,” he said. However, it’s not as simple as just using a throat swab to collect it.“There’s a technological factor,” he said. “How good are you at collecting a nasal swab versus an oral swab?”A throat swab is more complicated to perform. “Technique matters because you can have a perfect test and if you just swab loosely or lightly because you have a sensitive nose or sensitive mouth, you might not get enough virus for your test to detect it anyway irrespective of where the virus lives,” Tran said.If someone has symptoms of COVID-19 but gets a negative result on an at-home antigen test, Tran said to go to the doctor or to get a PCR test because it’s important to test over time.“At some point, the viral concentration goes up high enough where the test will pick it up anyway,” he said. “But if you are symptomatic, test negative, out of the abundance of precaution, you should still mask up, you should still try to stay away from people.” Advertisement     Michael Mina, chief science officer of eMed, said during a Zoom webinar Thursday that throat swabbing for COVID-19 is still so new, many people might not know how to do it, but he’s hopeful people will learn.“We know throat swabs can work, but saliva is different,” he said. “Throat swabs might be working because they’re mixing with saliva in terms of where you’re putting your swab in your oropharynx or your cheeks depending on how you’re doing it.”He said antigen tests have always been less sensitive than PCR tests, but it’s not that antigen tests aren’t detecting Omicron, it’s just that people are becoming infectious with this variant before the virus has a chance to grow into the nose. Like Tran, Mina said symptomatic people should assume they have COVID-19.Mina said swabbing the throat can be dangerous, so people should follow the FDA guidance, but he acknowledged the FDA also has to exist within tight guidelines that sometimes have more practical than scientific origins.“I think oftentimes people assume that the way it’s been authorized by the FDA is always optimal, like the spacing with the vaccines,” Mina said. “The three to four weeks was not optimal, that was out of convenience to get the clinical trials done quickly. But then because that’s the data that’s given to the FDA, that’s what the FDA has to authorize because they don’t have other data to suggest otherwise even if the science says a different picture.”He admitted he does swab his throat when he’s using an at-home test, but if others do the same, they should do so at their own risk. Advertisement     Blythe Adamson, a health economist and pharmacoepidemiologist serving as principal quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health, told BuzzFeed News that she thinks as soon as scientists believe throat swabbing is safe and effective, the FDA will most likely move quickly to authorize it.In a statement provided to BuzzFeed News, an FDA spokesperson said COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized.“The FDA has noted safety concerns regarding self-collection of throat swabs, as they are more complicated than nasal swabs – and if used incorrectly, can cause harm to the patient. The CDC recommends that throat swabs be collected by a trained healthcare provider.”On Twitter, the FDA said that they don't have any data that suggests throat swabs are accurate.

A mom who went viral on TikTok for dancing next to her newborn as he received supplemental oxygen in a hospital said she posted the video just to share her son's health condition.""I would say the mistake I made was not giving enough context of the situation,"" the 28-year-old mom of two, Whitney Leavitt, told BuzzFeed News.The captions explained that her son Liam had been diagnosed with RSV, a common respiratory condition for which some infants need to receive oxygen via a nasal cannula. Advertisement     In the video, Leavitt dances next to her son as Kendrick Lamar's ""Love"" plays, hitting every beat.People online were confused and angry, insinuating that Leavitt was careless to dance beside her child in a hospital. The tabloids, including the Mail Online and the Sun, also picked up the story. A reposted video on Twitter has 4.7 million views.
 



 


""It was really bad, people were telling me to end my life, they wished my family would die,"" said Leavitt, who took down the video following the hate messages.She found out about the backlash on her second day in the hospital.""I felt like I had completely lost control to clear up the context of everything of why I made the video and the reason of what motivated me to make the video and I feel like people completely took it out of context,"" Leavitt said. Advertisement     She added that the reason she made the video was because people were asking about his condition while Liam was in the hospital and all her videos involve dancing.""Dancing and having captions answering a comment is in line with content I've always created,"" she said.
 


Leavitt's husband called her about the video going viral and said that it was everywhere. ""He was like, 'I think we need to take it down,' and it wasn't until that point that I looked it up and it had gone everywhere,"" she said.Like many people, Leavitt said she joined TikTok out of boredom from quarantining and started her account as something fun to do.At first, she began posting relatable mom content and memes. Then, when she got pregnant with her second child, Leavitt decided to start dancing again.
 


""I don't know why I didn't do this from the beginning because I enjoy it so much,"" she said.Leavitt danced at a competitive studio for years and then stopped when she became pregnant with her first child.She said that her second pregnancy was great and a lot different than the first one, which she found very hard. ""I wonder if dancing maybe helped — brought up my spirit,"" she added.Meanwhile, Liam is now doing great and doesn't need oxygen support.""He's awesome. He's healthy. He's sleeping horribly. But other than that, he's doing great,"" Leavitt said.
 


According to the Daily Dot, Leavitt's video got 1.6 million views before she took it down. Since then, the video has actually started a meme in which people dance to the same song with hypothetical situations.For example, there's one where someone dances with captions about their court date, or another where someone dances while the captions say they have been evicted because they didn't know they were supposed to pay rent every month. Advertisement     Leavitt wasn't aware that she'd started a mini trend, but she said that since the video hit the tabloids, she has started to think more about her content.""I don't want people to think that I didn't learn from this, because I definitely did,"" she said.

The three white men who chased down and fatally shot Ahmaud Arbery on a Georgia road were sentenced to life in prison Friday.Travis McMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole after the judge said their actions showed little remorse for the chilling murder of the 25-year-old Black man. Advertisement     ""This was a killing,"" Judge Timothy Walmsley said. ""It was callous.""Neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, but only after serving 30 years.Walmsley handed down the sentence after Arbery's parents and sister made their case for the harshest sentence, arguing that the three men killed him when they couldn't scare him away from their neighborhood.""This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the court. ""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community. They chose to treat him differently than other people who frequently visited their community. And when they couldn't sufficiently scare or intimidate him, they killed him."" Advertisement     Her comment appeared to have struck the judge, who cited the statement as he handed out the sentence for the three men.""He was killed because individuals here in this courtroom took the law into their own hands,"" he said.The McMichaels and Bryan were convicted of felony murder in November for the daytime killing that was captured on video. Arbery, 25, was shot on Feb. 23, 2020, in Brunswick, Georgia, while he was running on a two-lane road.The McMichaels had told police there had been break-ins in the neighborhood and that they began to chase Arbery in their truck. The men then confronted him. After a struggle with a shotgun, Travis fired at Arbery, killing him.Despite the footage and admissions from the three men that they had chased down Arbery before Travis McMichael shot and killed him, no arrests were made for more than two months. The leaking of the video drew public outrage and cast skepticism on how local authorities were handling the investigation. A former prosecutor handling the case has since been charged with violating her oath of office and obstructing the investigation.""These brutal crimes nearly went unpunished because of the deep corruption that pervades so many of our systems,"" said Ben Crump, an attorney representing Arbery's family. ""But because of the video, and the public cries for accountability, Ahmaud's killers have finally been held to account — first by the jury and in today's sentencing.""Prosecutors on Friday argued the three men should be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and Arbery's parents issued emotional pleas agreeing with the harshest sentence. Advertisement     ""When I close my eyes, I see his execution in my mind, over and over,"" Arbery's father, Marcus Arbery, said. ""His killers should spend the rest of their lives thinking about what they did and what they took from us, and they should do it from behind bars because me and my family, we have to live with his death for the rest of their lives.""As he handed down his sentencing, Walmsley pointed out what he called ""chilling"" scenes from the video, which he said appeared to point to the defendants' demeanor immediately during and after the killing — factors he took into account in his decision.One of the scenes that stuck out in his mind, he said, was when Travis McMichael points the shotgun at Arbery.""When I thought about this, I thought from a lot of different angles, and I kept going back to the terror that must have been in the mind of the young man running through Satilla Shores,"" Walmsley said.The judge said he was also struck by the moment in the video immediately after Arbery is shot.""After Ahmaud Arbery fell, the McMichaels turned their backs,"" he said. ""They walked away.""
 


Defense attorneys asked for a lighter sentence of life with the possibility of parole, pointing to the men's lack of criminal history and what they said were lives of community service before the 2020 killing.

""He's not a perfect person, none of us are, but he's lived a good life, a life dedicated to service, and that does count for something.""Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, asked the court for an even lighter sentence than the mandatory minimum, arguing that, unlike the McMichaels, Bryan had expressed remorse over Arbery's death.""Whether it's part of the record or not, he expressed remorse over Mr. Arbery's death even before he was arrested on national television,"" Gough said. ""The Arbery family has not accepted that, and they don't have to, your honor, and we can understand why.""According to Gough, Bryan said that he wished he hadn't left his front porch and told one of the police officers he sometimes wished he had hit Arbery with his truck to prevent the shooting from taking place.But prosecutor Linda Dunikoski argued for all three to be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, saying they were taking acts of vigilantism by arming themselves to confront Arbery.Dunikoski took issue in particular to Hogue comparing the men's actions to those of a neighborhood watch, telling the judge that members of a neighborhood watch are there to monitor and be good witnesses.""That's what neighborhood watch is supposed to be, not somebody running after people in a residential neighborhood,"" she said.She asked the judge, in handing down his decision, to take into account Travis McMichael's demeanor on the stand when he testified.""[Travis McMichael] said that was the worst day of his life,"" she said, raising her voice. ""Well, how did that work out for Ahmaud Arbery?""Greg McMichael, Dunikoski said, has at times used his past as a law enforcement officer for his defense and, at others, seemed to ignore his training and experience for actions that would benefit him.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky warned on Friday that pediatric hospitals are seeing record numbers of children with COVID-19, as the Omicron variant surges nationwide.US coronavirus cases are currently higher than they’ve ever been, averaging around 600,000 new cases reported daily (itself an undercount), with hospitalization rates that have increased for people of all ages, according to Walensky, who briefed reporters on Friday. More than 1,200 people a day are dying of COVID-19 nationwide. Advertisement     “While children still have the lowest rate of hospitalization of any group, pediatric hospitalizations are at the highest rate compared to any prior point in the pandemic,” Walensky said. “Sadly, we are seeing the rates of hospitalization increasing for children 0 to 4, children who are not yet currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.”As of Jan. 1, the rate for COVID-19 hospitalizations among children under 4 was 4.3 cases per 100,000. That’s almost four times higher than it is among kids 5 to 17, who are eligible for vaccination, according to Walensky, and more than twice the hospitalization rate seen in this age group at the same time last year. She added that CDC data does show that children above the age of 4 are more likely to be in the hospital if they are unvaccinated.Walensky pointed out that some unknown number of these cases are incidental — children who test positive when they are hospitalized for non-COVID reasons. Many of the case reports of children come from asymptomatic kids who enter the hospital for elective procedures or other illnesses, she added, complicating the picture for epidemiologists trying to figure out risks for kids.George Rutherford, professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at UCSF, said these numbers show that COVID is widespread, is infecting children, and some proportion of them will be hospitalized. “Hospitalizations are going up. There's no reason to think that they wouldn't go up in children,” he said, adding that “children don't seem to be as unsusceptible to this as they have been to earlier strains.” Advertisement     But he thinks it’s too early to say that the proportion of infected children requiring hospitalization is growing nationally, partly because the CDC data is mostly from the northeastern region. Not knowing how many of these hospital cases are incidental makes the numbers even harder to interpret. “I've seen in London, where they actually do publish these data, that a third of COVID hospitalizations are incidental findings,” he added.Still, he said that COVID-19 is a serious disease for children, and protecting them while Omicron surges across the country is paramount.“In 2020 COVID was the seventh leading cause of death in children in the United States,” Rutherford said. “It is a big deal. And people who pooh-pooh it and say 'oh, it's no big deal' are blind to facts.”Masking in school and other indoor settings is helpful, he said, but what’s most important is for parents to try to ensure that everyone their child is in contact with is vaccinated and boosted (if they are eligible).It remains an open question whether Omicron is any more likely to lead to more severe disease in kids than other variants. This did not happen with Delta, Walensky said. “We are seeing a rise in hospitalizations, both because they are coming in with COVID but also because they're screening in for COVID,"" she said. ""[We] have not yet seen a signal that there is any increased severity in this age demographic.”Throughout the briefing, Walensky also defended the CDC against complaints that recent changes to protocols for isolating or quarantining after an infection, down to five days without symptoms, were confusing to the public or subject to disagreement from outside experts. Advertisement     “This virus has changed, and it's constantly throwing up curveballs,” Walensky said in response. As this virus changes, the CDC will have to change its guidance when working with state and local public health “to provide recommendations that are most feasible and can be implemented in communities across the country,” she said. “The past few weeks have been challenging for all of us.”

345,"""Dancing and having captions answering a comment is in line with content I've always created,"" said Whitney Leavitt","


In a scene from Netflix’s new reality show Hype House, 22-year-old Thomas Petrou, the de facto leader of the eponymous TikTok content collaborative, calls a meeting to discuss the members’ lack of hustle.When they gather — there are maybe 10 or so members — he looks around the room and wonders how the group got so small.“Everyone else got too famous,” one says with a laugh.This line encapsulates the central tension of Hype House, which manages to somehow make being young, rich, and famous in Los Angeles seem horribly depressing. The members of the Hype House, who are all in their late teens and early 20s, live together in a mansion and create content for TikTok as a collective under the assumption that bringing more creators together will make their videos more dynamic and interesting. Advertisement     No one in the house, though, seems to be enjoying themselves. Throughout the show’s eight episodes, the members of the house are palpably distressed, consumed with the need to succeed while watching their peers soar to heights they know they might not achieve.Even Chase “Lil Huddy” Hudson, a founding member who has become a breakout star, is stressed. Credited with helping to start an emo revival among Gen Z, Hudson was signed by Interscope Records, and here he seems to realize he needs to leave his old friends behind to advance his music career. Hudson approaches this dilemma with the awkwardness of a first-year college student trying to dump his high school girlfriend during Thanksgiving break. It’s clear he wants to move on — he has moved out of the Hype House into his own mansion — but he’s very aware that his clout was a major factor in the group’s success. Without him, what do they have?“Chase is the person who made the Hype House what it was. Because he's not here, everything in this brand falls on me,” Petrou remarks in one scene, noting in another that Hudson could lift any member to new heights by just posting them on his page every once in a while, but doesn’t.The Hype House was started in late 2019 by Hudson and Petrou and at one point counted bonafide TikTok sensations like the D'Amelio sisters (Charli appears briefly in the series, but isn’t interviewed) and Addison Rae among its ranks. Today, though, many of the stars have moved on, leaving Petrou to lead a stable of less experienced and less famous creators. “Less famous” is all relative; everyone in the house has millions of followers on TikTok, but the remaining team does not enjoy the same recognition as its superstar alumni. Advertisement     “We were like a family… it was so much fun just creating content every day, and now times have changed,” Petrou laments, interspersed with nostalgic clips of old Hype House videos.This is a problem for Petrou, who is trying to keep the Hype House afloat financially. He’s having trouble motivating his posse of mostly indistinguishable white dudebros to contribute to the house’s bottom line (one scene cuts from Petrou lecturing the group about their laziness to a shot of one member throwing a potted plant at another’s sleeping form).While Petrou frets to the camera about working 10- to 12-hour days to fulfill the group’s brand partnership deals, which pay for everything in the house, members like Connor Yates, 23, and Michael Sanzone, 19, lounge around acting like, well, young people who have no adult supervision and very little responsibility. “I’m so bored!” Yates complains.Ironically, the interesting thing about the majority of the Hype House members, considering their popularity, is how boring they are to watch. The majority are so unmemorable that I couldn’t name most of them, and very few outside of Hudson and Petrou have a storyline over the course of eight episodes. They all blend together, a mass of white, good-looking young people lounging around the house, eating snacks in sweatpants, and occasionally doing pranks or generic dances on TikTok.Larray, a YouTuber and semi-involved Hype House member, explains in one scene why he no longer goes to the house as much. “The vibes don’t hit,” he says. Advertisement     Larray and fellow YouTube star Nikita Dragun (who is friends with many of the members) are by far the most watchable cast members, which is odd because Dragun’s not actually in the Hype House and neither of them found fame primarily on TikTok. They’re so peripheral to the collective that you have to wonder if production brought them in to make up for the dull Hype House crew (they are also, notably, the only POC on the show).The YouTubers could certainly carry a show by themselves. Dragun is compelling (that’s how she became so famous!), but it often feels like she’s on a totally different show. She discusses the ins and outs of running her makeup line, which she developed after failing to find products she wanted as a trans woman, and drives around Los Angeles in her fuschia sports car complaining about Trisha Paytas attacking her on Twitter. I could have watched hours more of just that. But this is Hype House — she eventually has to drag herself back there to do things with the crew. She gets the boys into makeup and heels, and though it’s not as entertaining as watching her cut loose, it’s a reprieve from the monotony of the uninspired TikTokers.
 


Larray, who is known for his YouTube comedy, is also a standout, discussing his rise to social media fame and how it has impacted his life. Larray is extremely dynamic on camera, with a unique presence. In one poignant scene, he discusses how he became estranged from his parents when he came out as gay. His own crew seems more tightly bonded than the Hype House’s, from his loving grandmother and aunt in Compton to his roommate Ravon, who used to be a fan and got Larray’s attention by posting a Carpool Karaoke–style video featuring a cutout of the YouTuber in the passenger seat. Advertisement     Meanwhile, the members of the house who do have storylines mostly made me sad. Vinnie Hacker, a creator who looks like he stepped out of an Abercrombie catalog, openly struggles. As Dragun describes it, Hacker is “extremely sexualized” on TikTok because of his hot bod, but he’s really just a gamer at heart who wants to go on Twitch rather than post thirst traps.The other two members who get substantial screentime are young couple Alex Warren and Kouvr Annon, both 20 and original Hype House members. Both Warren and Annon open up to the cameras about their tumultuous childhoods and the instability they experienced before finding each other and the Hype House. This history contextualizes Warren’s thrumming anxiety, which radiates off him every time he’s onscreen. He’s constantly talking about making sure he gets more views, how popular he is, and how to remain popular.This leads him to plan more and more ambitious prank videos, with middling results. In one attempt, Warren hurts his ankle and spends many subsequent scenes hobbling around. In another, sadder scene, he convinces Annon to hold a fake wedding for a video, which he is convinced will get a good amount of views. Annon is quietly crushed; she says she would marry Warren for real, but he makes it clear he’s only interested in a stunt wedding. Annon tells the cameras she's ready to have a family with Warren, even though she’s only 20. Aware of the mismatch, the rest of the house awkwardly proceeds with the fake nuptials.
 


“I think it's a little cruel to be to honest, but at the same time, like I guess anything for views,” Dragun quips. (Warren later admits the video didn’t perform the way he had hoped.)All of this highlights the central issue, which is that the Hype House is a shell of its former self. There’s a lot of pressure to perform well, and the TikTokers’ mental health seems to be affected by these expectations. Even Petrou’s Hail Mary attempt to reclaim the former magic — a big group trip to Joshua Tree, where they can all create together in a new setting — ends in disappointment. After a night of fighting and bad vibes, Petrou slumps to the ground outside. He recites the names of Hype House girls who have made it big: Charli, Dixie, Addison.“I wish that they ever talked to me,” he says.“I’m just so scared of having to go back to where I came from,” Petrou says (he also opens up in the show about having a difficult upbringing). Annon later tells Petrou the same fear drives Warren, who admits on camera to being “very depressed.”The drama unfolding in Hype House reminds me of the TikTok sound slash Taylor Swift lyric: “I think I’ve seen this film before, and I didn’t like the ending.” Content houses like the Hype House have been popular since YouTube celebrities became a thing, and they aren’t a guaranteed path to fame and fortune. Perhaps the most well known, Jake Paul’s Team 10, was also once the darling of the social media scene and it launched several stars; Petrou himself was even briefly a member. Advertisement     However, in the years since, the Team 10 house has been accused of being host to bullying and sexual assault, and Paul was accused of exploiting the members and taking their profits. The house was raided by the FBI in 2020 after Paul was investigated over the looting of an Arizona mall.But perhaps most relevant to the members of Hype House is that many Team 10 members have vanished into obscurity. Many still work in the industry, like Nick Crompton, who was able to parlay his Team 10 experience into becoming vice president of commercial innovation and artist strategy at Universal Music Group, and Alissa Violet, who works as an Instagram influencer. But their clout is mostly gone, and they have been supplanted by newer, shinier objects — mainly, well, the kids of the Hype House.At the end of the show, Petrou seems to be wrapping his mind around the fact that the Hype House may not be long for this world. “It just doesn’t work anymore; I think it’s just time to shut [the Hype House] down,” he says.
 


In the final episode, Petrou reveals many of the key members, including Annon and Warren, have moved out, although they are still in the collective. It still exists, but the dysfunction makes you think: Is the Hype House still here because of the Netflix show, and not the other way around?If I was conspiratorially minded, I would say it’s like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous. “I feel like a kid who has all the toys in the world, but no batteries to operate them,” says Petrou in the last episode, head in his hands. Every single Hype House member seems miserable, and you just want to give them a hug, a nice place to sleep, and a 24-hour social media break.Hype House is certainly an interesting insight into the machinations of content houses and the struggles that come with them, but it is not a very fun or interesting show. By the end, I was begging the Hype House to break up and end our misery — as well as theirs. ●

346,"""This wasn't a case of mistaken identity or mistaken fact,"" Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, told the court. ""They chose to target my son because they didn't want him in their community.""","As any true Kardashian/Jenner fan would know, Kylie Jenner is due to give birth to her second child with Travis Scott any day now, after initially keeping her pregnancy a secret for months. However, many fans have now started to theorize that Kylie has actually given birth already — and they have the receipts to prove it. The theory — which immediately went extremely viral — bolstered other pregnancy clues spotted by fans, including the fact that Kylie’s birthday had been an uncharacteristically low-key affair and her recent reunion with former ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, which was seen as a way to repair the public’s perception of their relationship ahead of the news of a second pregnancy. Kylie went on to confirm the theories less than a month later, taking to Instagram to announce her pregnancy with a video charting its most special moments so far, alongside a caption tagging Travis. Now, the same TikTok user has done even more detective work and has come up with a new theory — that Kylie has already given birth and is keeping the news under wraps from the public. While the rest of her family were seen taking a shot with the host at the end of the show, Kylie turned away from the camera and did not consume the alcohol. Although the reunion didn’t air until June, Andy shared an Instagram video from the set on the date it was filmed — April 23. Emily points out that if Kylie already knew that she was pregnant by April 23, her due date would have been in the last week of December at the latest — meaning that baby number two should probably be here by now. And there’s further evidence to suggest that Kylie may have given birth weeks ago, starting with the Kar-Jenner’s famous Christmas Eve party on Dec. 24. Kylie opted to skip the annual bash and wasn’t seen in any of the photos, despite her 3-year-old daughter Stormi attending and being filmed alongside her cousins on Instagram. Interestingly, the toddler can be seen wearing a protective face mask in one of the brief clips that Khloé Kardashian shared to her story — the only family member to do so — suggesting that her household is taking particularly strict measures against COVID-19 at the moment, perhaps due to its vulnerable new addition. The plot thickened on Dec. 26, when Kourtney Kardashian’s fiancé, Travis Barker, shared a photo to his own social media page that had a pink-rimmed Comotomo newborn bottle in shot. Followers quickly realized that the current Kardashian/Jenner children are too old to be using this bottle, and some even noted that it was the same brand that Kylie used for Stormi when she was born. Kylie and Travis also used the holiday season to make a slow but carefully coordinated return to social media following their hiatus after the Astroworld tragedy, prompting speculation that they are building up to a big announcement. Kylie made her first post since the Nov. 5 tragedy on Christmas Eve, sharing a throwback photo of mom Kris Jenner. And for New Year's, she posted a black-and-white photo of herself showing off her bare bump and reflecting on the “blessings” and “heartache” 2021 brought her. Travis also posted for the first time since Astroworld on this date, sharing a black-and-white photo of himself looking at the ground. He simply wrote: “Always” alongside a brown heart emoji — something which appeared to be significant as Kylie shared two of them in the post’s comments, and Khloé four. Travis’s choice of caption also appears to be significant, with fans suggesting that “Always” or “Infinity” could be the new baby’s name after they noticed Kim Kardashian used the infinity emoji as a caption on a family photo on Jan. 4. These posts mark the first time the pair have posted on social media since 10 people died at the Astroworld tragedy seven weeks ago. Some fans have suggested that the couple are attempting to distance the news of their new arrival from the festival by sharing these interim posts. Just yesterday, Kylie took to Instagram again with more photos of her growing bump — which she captioned with the song lyrics “I am woman.” She also showed off her pregnancy body in videos posted over New Year. But despite using her Instagram comeback to try and dispel speculation that she’s already given birth, we know from her birthday posts that she’s no stranger to saving old videos and photos to share at a later date to throw fans off the scent. And, once again, her nails may have given the game away, with her choice of New Year’s manicure uncharacteristic to say the least. Celebrity nail technician Lisa Kon posted a close-up photo of Kylie’s fresh French manicure to her page last week (above), and fans quickly picked up on the fact that Kylie’s nails are much shorter than her usual style, which can be seen below. This suggests that the beauty guru has trimmed down her nails so as not to scratch her newborn when changing diapers and other day-to-day tasks that come with being a mom. Finally, claims that Kylie has secretly given birth reached fever pitch on Sunday, when she was suspiciously covered with blankets as she, Kris Jenner, and Corey Gamble were photographed departing a private jet. Of course the decision to cover up Kylie’s body raises questions, but her decision to fly at all while heavily pregnant is also highly suspicious. Pregnant women are advised against flying after 36 weeks, which Kylie would be well over if she became pregnant in April. And, finally, fans have also been quick to point out that this wouldn’t be the first time that Kylie has kept details of her pregnancy and delivery private. Back in 2017, she not only went into hiding and kept her first pregnancy a secret for the full nine months, but didn’t even announce the arrival of Stormi until Feb. 4, 2018 — three days after giving birth."

Three weeks later their local councilors in the idyllic Dutch hamlet of Zeewolde voted 11–8 to rezone a swath of fertile farming land half the size of Central Park and hand it to Facebook to build its “hyperscale” data center — the largest in Holland.The local councilors, including those who voted in favor of the data center, engaged with the company for almost two years prior to the vote — but without knowing that “Tulip,” the mysterious entity they’d been negotiating with, was Facebook. In fact, the councilors were among the last to know, finding out only after Facebook issued a press release revealing Tulip’s true identity ahead of the vote. Advertisement  Facebook’s demand for secrecy around its data center in the Netherlands is the latest example of Big Tech’s aggressive but covert strategy to squeeze concessions from local governments. The veil of secrecy minimizes public scrutiny and backlash, often until it is too late.“It is very strange. Everything is normally very transparent — but with data centers, it is like a big black mystic box,” said Lars Ruiter, a former municipal councilor from Hollands Kroon, who told BuzzFeed News that his village found itself in a nearly identical situation in 2017 with a secret Microsoft data center project.
 


Since the Zeewolde vote, a firestorm of public criticism has compelled the Dutch national Senate to pass a parliamentary motion asking the government to halt the project pending a national policy on data centers. But such motions are usually not legally binding, and opponents of the data center are leaning on the commitment of the Netherlands’ newly formed government to present such a policy.Data centers are the cornerstone of cloud computing. They allow you to access your Google drive from any device anywhere in the world, upload photographs to your Instagram account, and stream Netflix. The business is extraordinarily profitable: Last year, Amazon’s cloud service, for example, had earned over $40 billion in revenue as of October. But data centers like the one Facebook proposed suck up enough energy to power a small town, use millions of gallons of water a day to cool their servers, and typically provide few jobs. This has raised questions about their sustainability, their impact on communities around them, and Big Tech’s insistence on building them in secret.In 2019, officials in Texas approved $10 million in tax breaks for a data center operated by a developer named Sharka LLC — later revealed to be Google. In Iowa, Microsoft has built at least three data centers while shielding its name from the public, according to the Des Moines Register. Facebook was believed to be using a shell company in Utah to push through bills favorable to data centers as far back as 2016.In the Netherlands, Facebook encountered a national and local bureaucracy eager to attract a major US tech giant but wary of the environmental costs and public resistance. So in late 2019, when Facebook first began exploring the possibility of building in Zeewolde, its identity was known only to a few senior officials in the national government. The mayor of Zeewolde found out a year into negotiations in early 2021, the King’s commissioner of the region a short time later. The people of Zeewolde were the last to know.Meanwhile, the company embarked on a bare-knuckle offensive to secure the land, despite Dutch bureaucrats noting that the project in Zeewolde violated the National Strategy on Spatial Planning and the Environment and suggesting a different site.But Facebook was adamant about its chosen location. It even asked the government to designate its data center a project of “national importance,” a Dutch national policy normally intended to expedite land acquisition and project clearances for vital infrastructure like the national electricity grid.“The designation of a data center of national importance has never been done, so this would be difficult to explain and create a precedent for the establishment of (more) other data centers,” a Dutch bureaucrat tersely noted in an internal memo obtained by De Telegraaf. “It also seems undesirable to us to state that the location in Zeewolde is of national importance.”
 


Sandra Beckerman, a member of Dutch Parliament from the Socialist Party, said the laws around projects of national importance were drafted during the 2008 financial crisis and had been misused in the past. “The idea was to speed up projects in order to create jobs,” she said, which meant “far less democratic control by either local, regional governments or the public.” Large companies, she said, had “profited hugely from this law while local communities are deprived of rights they used to have.”Facebook also pushed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy to lean on the state-owned electricity utility to prioritize the company’s demands for its electricity substation, warning that it would consider establishing the data center in another country if its demands weren’t met. “Tulip offers us little or no time to continue working on this: they are already asking for a clear signal from EZK this or next week,” another memo said, noting that Facebook was actively lobbying the Dutch government to take urgent action. EZK is the Dutch acronym for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.The ministry’s bureaucrats worried that prioritizing Facebook’s demands would distort the expansion of the Dutch national grid. But they had little leverage to negotiate. “They have a preferred position because they have a lot of money and they can pay for that,” said Ben Sonneveld, a councilor who voted against the project. “They were treated differently than others who do not have the money and have to wait.”In the end, an accommodation for the substation was made, but demand to designate the project a data center of national importance was denied.
 


Rob Smeets, a former Zeewolde councilor who opposed the project, resigned from his post weeks before the crucial vote, telling the Dutch press he had done so under pressure from his own party after flagging unspecified conflicts of interest in the negotiations. He was replaced by Hank Parisius, a party colleague who voted in the favor of the project. Had Smeets stayed, Facebook’s margin of victory would have been a much narrower 10–9.Smeets told BuzzFeed News that he stood by his statement to the Dutch press but declined to elaborate on his allegations. Parisius did not respond to a request for comment.Beckerman, the MP, said years of budgetary cuts had disempowered local governments by making them far too reliant on property taxes. Facebook’s new data center could contribute up to 2 million euros a year in taxes to Zeewolde’s municipal budget, according to the mayor’s office. “Local and regional governments don't have the power to fight large companies,” she told BuzzFeed News. “They are willing to work with these tech companies because they are always in money troubles.”
 


Facebook’s data center project in Zeewolde and the company’s efforts to hide its involvement from the people who live there are particularly contentious because they touch on two emotive national issues: land and green energy, both of which are in short supply.The Netherlands is one of Europe’s more densely populated major nations, much of the acreage lies below sea level and is protected from flooding by oceanfront dykes, and also among the most reliant on fossil fuels. But the country is also the landing point for a bundle of transatlantic undersea telecommunication cables and home to one of Europe’s biggest internet exchanges, making it a compelling destination for data centers like Facebook’s.The Netherlands is also a tax haven. The Tax Justice Network ranks it fourth in the world behind the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and Bermuda for “​​global tax abuse,” and eighth for “financial secrecy.” Which is worth noting, because when the first tranche of land for Facebook’s data center in Zeewolde was acquired, the sale was made to a shell company called Polder Networks. Company documents obtained by BuzzFeed News show Polder’s sole shareholder is a company called Liberation Management, which advertises itself as a discreet consultancy with offices in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Polder and Liberation did not respond to requests for comment, but Facebook spokesperson Kim van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News, “Polder Networks B.V. is the legal representative of Meta in the Netherlands that builds and manages the data center.”This combination of corporate secrecy, tax discretion, and telecom connectivity has meant Amsterdam is now home to one of Europe’s biggest concentrations of data centers — but much of the data in the Netherlands serves users around the world. Advertisement  “Two-thirds of the data center capacity in the Netherlands is used for companies and residents not in the Netherlands,” said René Buck, founder of Buck Consultants International. Last year, a Buck Consultants International study commissioned by the Dutch government suggested that large-scale data centers offer little direct economic benefit to the communities that live around them.
 


“We often spread data needs throughout our data center infrastructure — in fact, we currently serve traffic quickly and reliably around the world,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News. “So there is no guarantee that user traffic in the region will be served exclusively by this facility.Data centers consume large amounts of energy, but with many big tech companies eager to burnish their green credentials, they are increasingly located near sources of renewable energy. Many data centers in the Netherlands are monopolizing scarce green energy supplies for their own use to the chagrin of local communities.In 2017, for instance, Microsoft announced its massive data center in the Netherlands was buying up 100% of the electricity produced by a giant wind farm not far from Amsterdam. Microsoft touted this as an example of its commitment to sustainability, a perspective faithfully reproduced in sections of the press. Back in the Netherlands, commentators noted that the wind farm produced enough energy to power 370,000 homes — but all the energy was being sucked up by a single American company.Beckerman told BuzzFeed News outrage was building among citizens irked to see their tax dollars funneled into renewable energy investments that largely benefited foreign companies. “People can’t pay their energy bill, and 50% of the energy bill is made up of taxes,” she said.The municipality of Zeewolde estimates Facebook’s data center would use twice the energy used by the whole town. Ben Sonneveld, a Zeewolde councilor who voted against the project, said the company had not been upfront about how this green energy would be sourced.
 


Most of Zeewolde’s energy comes from about 400 windmills on the outskirts of the town. Project opponents like Sonneveld fear that, much like Microsoft’s data center in neighboring Holland Kroons, Facebook's arrival in Zeewolde would mean more common lands lost to windmills. While the company has made no specific references to investing in wind farms in Zeewolde, the secrecy around the project thus far has meant residents fear they will only find out about any potential wind farms when it is too late.“I calculate that we need another 140 windmills,” Sonneveld said. “So where do we put them? Nobody knows.”Zeewolde Mayor Gerrit Jan Gorter, a strong proponent of the project, told BuzzFeed News that Facebook had not received any financial incentives or tax breaks to invest in Zeewolde and that a data center in the town did not violate planning guidelines. He argued that the data center will bring jobs and investment to the region. The town council is looking to build more windmills in Zeewolde, he said, but the windmill project predates and would not be directly connected to the data center project. Gorter said Facebook’s data center intends to use “100% green power” by purchasing green certificates (known as ""guarantees of origin,"" or GVO) across the European electricity network. A GVO is essentially like a carbon credit, but for renewable energy.Gorter said the secrecy around Facebook’s data center was standard operating procedure when attracting new investment to the region to ensure that the local government did not discriminate between companies.“The actual name of the company should not make a difference as they only have to decide whether a company meets the requirements for establishment in Zeewolde,” said Gorter, referring to the recently concluded council vote on the project, “and that does not depend on the name of the company.”And Facebook argued that despite the secrecy around the project, it only has the best of intentions. ""We understand and respect that any major project and change can lead to questions and concerns. It is therefore good to emphasize that we do everything we can to be a good neighbor for everyone in the area, such as the farmers and residents of the municipality of Zeewolde,” van Bokhoven told BuzzFeed News.
 


As late as 1972, the entire province of Flevoland, where Zeewolde is situated, was a shallow brackish marsh. Every acre in Zeewolde, residents said, was painstakingly claimed by damming an inlet of the North Sea — the culmination of a decadeslong process that began in 1924 and ended sometime in 1984.“It’s a very young village, it’s the youngest village in our country. The land is very fertile. So to give 166 hectares of fertile land to metal boxes is beyond our imagination,” said Susan Schaap, who said she moved here 23 years ago. “Zeewolde is a beautiful village. There’s a lot of woods, there’s a beach, there’s sun, there’s a lot of sand, there’s a lot to do for children.”Schaap is the administrator of Stichting DataTruc Zeewolde, a Facebook group of residents opposed to the data center in their village.
 


“It’s not like it’s a data center where they store all this data for maybe payments, hospital applications, or, you know, medical things,” Schaap said. “They have all this information stored from people, which they sell to advertisers.”For now, the public backlash against the deal has slowed the sale of the land. A spokesperson for the Netherlands’ Central Government Real Estate Agency said the land would be transferred to Facebook only if a set of mandatory sustainability requirements were met.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy is slowly walking back its public support for the data center despite doing everything in its power to help Facebook. When BuzzFeed News asked the ministry for its formal position on Facebook’s data center, its spokesperson deferred to Zeewolde’s municipality.Beckerman, the opposition MP, said the various accommodations offered to Facebook stood in stark contrast to the experiences of the ordinary Dutch citizen when interacting with their local government.“I guess people are really fed up with the government always acting in the best interest of these large companies,” Beckerman said, adding this was “another example of a government putting too much energy and time and money in these kinds of companies.” ●

In the beginning, it was scary, but it was also relatively simple: Stay home. Shut down. Wear a mask. Stay 6 feet apart. Get your shot.Now, though, things feel a lot more complicated.You can get together safely with vaccinated loved ones over the holidays, but maybe you should reconsider. Omicron appears to be more infectious, but less deadly; though you should still worry about Delta, which is less infectious, but more deadly. Schools are still open — until they’re not, sometimes not even virtually. Social media is full of posts from friends either out partying or at home quarantining. Please still wear a mask in public, but not a cloth one, even though it’s still common to exercise in most gyms without one altogether. Rapid tests are useful but hard to find and maybe not so useful after all. Fully vaccinated means two shots, but also get your booster. If you have COVID but don’t have symptoms you should isolate for 10 days — no, wait, it’s five now — but then only reenter public in a mask if you can test negative, but also if you can’t find a test, that’s OK too. Advertisement  As Americans prepare to enter their third straight year of the coronavirus pandemic, clarity feels hard to come by for many.“Honestly I’m more confused now than I was all of 2020,” said Luis Luna, a 28-year-old advertising accounts manager in Austin. “So many friends and family got infected in December, and everyone had different symptoms. It’s just hard to keep up with instructions from the CDC and most government agencies.”
 


Ileana Schinder, an architect in Washington, DC, was in tears as she described the stress and concern she has for her two young children who are lurching back and forth between classroom instruction and remote learning with each new outbreak in their class. Schinder, 45, said she feels hollow and exhausted, as if she’s run a marathon in pursuit of a bus that keeps driving forward one block at a time, over and over. “I’m an architect. I should be able to design my way out of this mental labyrinth, but I can’t,” she said. “Can you?”The world looks markedly different than it did when COVID first swept and shuttered the globe. There are now multiple vaccines that are safe and effective at preventing serious illness. More than 4.6 billion people around the world have had at least one shot. We know infinitely more about the virus, including how to test for it relatively cheaply and easily. We have new lifesaving treatments. “This is not March of 2020,” President Joe Biden assured a weary public just before Christmas. “Two hundred million [Americans] are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.”And yet as Omicron now infects record numbers of people globally, filling up hospitals and closing businesses and classrooms, there is a lingering and strange sense of déjà vu, even if it also feels different this time.
 


“Earlier in the pandemic, I was actually really scared I could end up killing my mother. That was a very real fear,” said Allison Clough, a 50-year-old mother of two teens in the Bay Area who asked to be identified by her middle name so as not to embarrass her kids. “I don’t think that’s very likely anymore. I don’t feel scared in that way, but it’s ruining our lives again. I guess it’s kind of confusing.”As regular people struggle to make sense of this point in the pandemic, experts are also wondering how we got here — and how we haven’t done a better job of preparing for it. “We’re in a difficult time. We’re in a strange time,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “We’re in a time where we’ve had two years of experience with this disease, with this virus, and it continues to evolve … But as it evolves, we’re still in many ways kind of chasing it.”
 


Arthur Caplan, medical ethics director at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, was far more blunt and sweeping in his assessment of the current state of confusion. “I would say we’re in a cacophonous, disorienting, deteriorating mess,” he said.“Many people have no idea what to do about something simple like masking,” he continued. “Huge numbers of people are frustrated by the complete failure to provide adequate amounts of test kits. Parents are furious they’re not getting consistent policies that should have been planned weeks ago about what happens to their kids. Messaging from the CDC and other government authorities has become a mishmash of confusion for many people. Most people I talk to don’t know what fully vaccinated means and no one seems to be helping them understand it. And the internet is awash with escalating misinformation and conspiracy content.“Otherwise,” Caplan joked, “things are good.”
 


It is somewhat inevitable that the pandemic and people’s decision matrix have become more complex, given both the evolving nature of affairs and the virus itself. Even before the Omicron variant emerged, requiring yet more study and analysis, people around the world were already trying to adapt their lives around COVID. Workers were returning to offices. International borders had reopened. People were dancing in nightclubs again, albeit in many places that check vaccine cards at the door. We got to celebrate Thanksgiving.Omicron then arrived at a time when each person’s perception of risk was already changing, at an inflection point in public thinking. After a summer dashed by Delta, many had already begun to imagine a world where COVID would be with us for quite some time. The new variant’s incredible infectiousness, and apparent relative mildness for vaccinated individuals, has only seemed to deepen a sense of inevitability for many people. As comic Isabel Hagen joked, “Making plans in 2022: I can’t get covid this week, but I could next week?”“It’s with us. It’s omnipresent,” said American Medical Association President Gerald Harmon. “We’re trying to adapt to that and we’re trying to avoid being overrun, not only in our day-to-day lives but in our healthcare systems.”“We want to have this in the rearview mirror and we can’t quite get there,” Harmon said. “It always seems to be alongside us in the passing lane, and every now and then it gets ahead of us.” Advertisement  The AMA was especially critical this week of the CDC’s evolving guidance on quarantine and isolation, which has seesawed on whether a negative test was necessary for asymptomatic people to reenter public life after five days. The guidance has even confused US senators. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, whose communication skills have come under intense scrutiny, had defended the decision by arguing the tests don’t definitively show whether someone is still infectious, but large sectors of the public have not been able to keep up with this nuance.With an unmistakable sense of incredulity, Harmon released a statement on Wednesday in which the AMA president appeared aghast at the CDC. “Nearly two years into this pandemic, with Omicron cases surging across the country, the American people should be able to count on [the CDC] for timely, accurate, clear guidance to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their communities,” he said. “Instead, the new recommendations on quarantine and isolation are not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus.”Harmon told BuzzFeed News his intention was not to assign blame and that he still has trust and confidence in the CDC, but that he felt a duty to speak out at what he saw as mixed messaging. “When I see something that’s a little bit incongruent, it makes me a little bit uncertain,” he said.In defending the CDC, one prominent scientist who spoke with BuzzFeed News — but asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the questions — said they believed there is a “false assumption” that experts are all-knowing all the time. “There’s this idea in the public that the knowledge is kind of static: ‘Just tell us what it is! Why are you waffling around?’” this scientist said. Advertisement  “But the knowledge is accruing day by day and it’s going to change day by day as the data changes. It’s not something that can be reduced to one simple sentence because there’s all these ‘if not this, then that, and if not that, then this.’ It gets very geeky.”“I don’t think the scientists and the public health experts are confused. But there is uncertainty,” they said, citing the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. “It’s a different thing, though, to not be confused and to know what’s going to happen. The scientists don’t know what’s going to happen, but they’re not confused about what does happen.”For regular Americans, though, it has been somewhat hard to keep up. “In my opinion, the CDC has been frustratingly unclear on defining a mask’s effect on determining close contacts,” said Roger Yamada, a 38-year-old attorney in New York City. “How do we assess cloth masks vs. surgical masks vs. KN95/KF94/N95 masks? Or does it not matter at all?”“More than anything it’s just annoying,” said Daniel Golson, a 28-year-old social media editor in Los Angeles, who with his friends is navigating the maze of testing and isolation guidelines after an outbreak among some of them on a New Year’s trip to Montana. “I want to do the right thing to prevent me from potentially infecting others, but I also don't want to unnecessarily spend money to have to stay in a place and not go home if I don't need to.”
 


Public health officials have been clear that this Omicron wave is not like previous surges. Top White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci has said it was “very prudent” for the CDC to try to change its guidance based on the emerging data on the variant’s transmissibility and period of infectiousness, in order to try to avoid massive staff shortages across every industry and effectively keep society running. Fauci also said this past weekend that the US was entering a new stage of the pandemic where hospitalizations, not total caseloads, should be the focus of public attention.But the prominent scientist said it was evident there was something of a fissure between experts and the public. “The American public has become over decades science illiterate,” they said. “Scientists tend to talk in a different language than regular people can understand. It’s kind of a mismatch between those who communicate and those who want to be communicated with not talking the same language.”
 


Caplan, the NYU medical ethicist, said he believed that due to this scientific illiteracy, it was natural that people have become confused, even angry, by the shifting messages. “If you have lousy training on critical thinking and scientific methods in your high schools and junior high schools then it’s no accident that citizens don’t know how to interpret what’s going on in a plague,” he said.Clough, the Bay Area mother, said her friendship circles seem torn in two by those who are afraid and still want restrictive measures and those who are resigned to trying to live in what they feel is their new reality. “Some of my friends are worried school closures are going to be a drag and others are still afraid they’re gonna die,” she said. “It’s a little hard to navigate between all that.”Tensions are also high in her community, where whether or not your children will be in class can depend on a county line. Everyone she knows is vaccinated, including her kids and their friends, but there seems to be politics everywhere. She’s noticed people again walking solo on the beach but still wearing a mask, which she thinks they’re doing as some sort of statement. She said she was accused of wanting to murder teachers when she raised a statistic about the extremely low risk of children becoming extremely ill or dying from COVID. “Just looking at the numbers, the chance that even without the booster shot my 13-year-old is going to end up seriously ill is vanishingly small,” she said, “but it’s become so politicized in my extremely liberal community that it’s almost like some people want to hold on to the possibility of that against all this data.”In DC, Schinder, the architect and mother, begrudgingly admitted she’s even begun to question her own Democratic politics when she looks with jealousy at photos of friends’ children in Republican-led states where schools have stubbornly stayed open through most of the pandemic. How is it fair, she wonders, that her city’s leaders seem to be prioritizing people’s right to go to bars over her kids being in a classroom?
 


“If you’d have told me that two years down the road my kids wouldn’t be in school, I’d have thought that we didn’t yet have a vaccine, a health solution. But we’ve moved on from that. We have a health solution,” Schinder said. “What pains me is we’re still adapting every decision to those that effectively decide to ride bicycles without a helmet, to those that ride in cars without seatbelts. I think it’s time to move on.”A group of former Biden expert advisers might agree with her. Six scientists who served on the president’s transition health advisory board on Thursday published a series of opinion pieces in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for the administration to now focus on what they called “the new normal of life with COVID.” Omicron, they said, had “created concern about a perpetual state of emergency.”They advocated, among other things, for changes and improvements to testing, vaccine mandates and technology, and data collection. But more than anything, they said the focus needed to be on the future, not the cloud of the current crisis. “We think a lot of work still needs to be done to see through that smoke to see how this is going to end, and start laying down steps for how we will be able to live a normal life,” one of the scientists, Rick Bright, told the New York Times.Both the APHA’s Benjamin and the AMA’s Harmon said they also felt more of a focus on modeling was needed to better predict and respond to future iterations of this virus and others so as to avoid more chaos. That could include extensive new investment in public health infrastructure and preventative medicine, such as vaccines.“The nature of the virus is unpredictable, but that’s the nature of any enemy,” said Harmon, a retired Air Force major general. “Using a military analogy, we need to not fight the current war or previous wars, we need to plan for future engagements. We need to think of asymmetric warfare with this virus.”Still, Harmon said, right now an urgent challenge is to try to reach those weary soldiers on the homefront who are finding themselves, like Clough in the Bay Area, struggling to see the way forward.“Even when things seem nutty, I don’t have the energy to develop strong opinions and advocate for them like I did in the first shutdown,” Clough said. “I can’t muster the same passion for it that I had earlier. I feel tired. I feel a little bit resigned to whatever is going to happen.” ●

349,It’s almost like the show was made with the explicit purpose of convincing teenagers it sucks to be social media famous.,"


Sidney Poitier, the trailblazing Bahamian American actor whose commanding talent and immense charm helped him shatter racial barriers in Hollywood and pave the way for generations of Black talent, died Thursday. He was 94.His death was announced by Bahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis, who said in an address that his country was mourning the cultural icon.“We admire the man, not just because of his colossal achievements,” Davis said, “but also because of who he was, his strength of character, his willingness to stand up and be counted, and the way he plotted and navigated his life’s journey.” Advertisement  The first Black man to win an Oscar, Poitier was revered around the world for helping to advance US racial dialogue in the turbulent 1960s through his art and celebrity.At their core, his most celebrated performances — a wandering and wry ex-soldier helping a group of nuns build a chapel in Lilies of the Field; the patient yet stern teacher to an unruly London high school class in To Sir, With Love; a cerebral detective battling racism and crime in the Deep South in In the Heat of the Night — were each built off a quiet elegance and beguiling grace that were unmistakably Poitier’s own.A lion of American cinema, Poitier has been championed as a pioneer and personal role model by some of the country’s most celebrated Black entertainers, including Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones, and Oprah Winfrey. At a 1992 event honoring Poitier, the actor was stunned to discover civil rights icon Rosa Parks was in the audience. She, too, admitted to being a Poitier fan.“It’s been said that Sidney Poitier does not make movies, he makes milestones —milestones of artistic excellence, milestones of America’s progress,” said former president Barack Obama in honoring the actor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 — some 42 years after Poitier’s character in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner dreamed of his biracial children one day growing up to be president.
 


Poitier was born two months prematurely in Miami in 1927, and his parents were impoverished tomato farmers visiting from the Bahamas. At a loss, his mother took her weak baby to a fortune-teller who assured her: “Don’t worry about your son. He will not be a sickly child. He will walk with kings. He will step on pillars of gold. And he will carry your name to many places.” (Evelyn Poitier lived long enough to see her son become the first Black Best Actor winner.)Raised in the Caribbean nation until he was a teenager, on an island he once said had just two white people on it, Poitier grew up unaware of the racial politics simmering just across the sea in the US. “No one ever told me, ‘You must be careful because there are things out there that are not friendly [for Black people],’” he later said.After arriving in the US, and a brief service in the medical corps during World War II, he was rejected from New York City’s American Negro Theater because of his accent. Fueled by the sting of rejection, he fastidiously listened to radio announcers, mimicking their enunciation to shed his own until he was accepted into the same theater group just six months later.A career on Broadway followed, but cinema proved more difficult due to the scarcity of roles for Black actors that weren’t steeped in racial stereotypes. “It was difficult. [Black actors] were so new in Hollywood. There was almost no frame of reference for us except as stereotypical, one-dimensional characters,” he told Winfrey in 2000. “Not only was I not going to do that, but I had in mind what was expected of me — not just what other Blacks expected but what my mother and father expected. And what I expected of myself.” Advertisement  His early screen roles reflected his unwillingness to cater to Hollywood’s restrictive demands in favor of more challenging fare: a Black doctor caring for a bigoted white criminal in 1950’s No Way Out (so controversial it was banned in the British-ruled Bahamas and parts of the US); a clergyperson in apartheid South Africa in Cry, the Beloved Country (1951); and an inner-city high school tough brimming with untapped potential in Blackboard Jungle (1955).In 1959, he became the first Black man to be nominated for a competitive Academy Award for his role as a prison escapee in The Defiant Ones — a film he later said he was only able to do because he agreed to act in another film he found more problematic, 1960’s Porgy and Bess.He also starred in the 1959 milestone premiere of Lorraine Hansberry’s now-classic play A Raisin in the Sun, the first play ever written by a Black woman to show on Broadway. “Never before,” declared the writer James Baldwin, “had so much of the truth of Black people’s lives been seen onstage.”
 


But it was during the 1960s that Poitier truly came into his own, delivering a series of performances that would leave indelible marks on American cinema.He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for 1963’s Lilies of the Field, cementing his place in movie history as the first Black man to take home an Oscar. (Hattie McDaniel had won the Best Supporting Actress prize in 1940 for her role in Gone With the Wind.)Not expecting to prevail in a category that included Albert Finney, Richard Harris, Rex Harrison, and Paul Newman, Poitier had prepared no acceptance speech but took the stage to thunderous applause.“Because it is a long journey to this moment, I am naturally indebted to countless numbers of people,” a visibly emotional Poitier told the Oscars crowd in his acceptance speech.
 


His most prolific year came in 1967 with the release of To Sir, With Love; In the Heat of the Night; and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, one of the most notable films to so directly address and debate the racial politics that America was grappling with during the decade. As Poitier’s character meets the supposedly enlightened parents (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, in his final role) of his white fiancé (Katharine Houghton), the four must confront the prejudices and fears of the era in 100 minutes of domestic discussion.“You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it’s got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight of you be off our backs!” Poitier’s character tells his father (Roy E. Glenn) in one of the film’s most memorable speeches. “You think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man.”By 1967’s end, the most famous Black man in cinema was also the industry’s top-grossing box office star of the year.
 


Poitier’s most iconic characters were, by and large, honorable men — endlessly patient, reliably affable, and wholly stripped of any semblance of sexuality — a conscious choice, he said, because of the pressures of history weighing upon him.Citing Quincy Jones, Winfrey later told Poitier he had “created and defined the African American in film.”“It’s been an enormous responsibility,” he acknowledged. “And I accepted it, and I lived in a way that showed how I respected that responsibility. I had to. In order for others to come behind me, there were certain things I had to do.”
 


His character choices also earned him his detractors, though, with some turning on him for supposedly playing exclusively to white America. “He thinks these films have really been helping to change the stereotypes that Black actors are subjected to,” African American playwright Clifford Mason wrote in a famous 1967 New York Times piece titled “Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?” “In essence, they are merely contrivances, completely lacking in any real artistic merit. In all of these films he has been a showcase nigger, who is given a clean suit and a complete purity of motivation so that, like a mistreated puppy, he has all the sympathy on his side.”Poitier told Winfrey the “Uncle Tom” backlash was hurtful but not totally unexpected in the turbulence of the civil rights era: “It was far from the truth, but I understood the times. There was a public display of all the rage that [Black people] had built up over centuries.”“What the name-callers missed was that the films I did were designed not just for Blacks but for the mainstream,” he said. “I was in concert with maybe a half dozen filmmakers, and they were all white. And they chose to make films that would make a statement to a mainstream audience about the awful nature of racism.”The criticism led Poitier to a “crossroads” in his career, as he termed it, moving him behind the camera to the director’s chair.Apart from reprising his In the Heat of the Night role in two sequels, his career in the 1970s was most notable for the many films he directed (and in which he also occasionally starred): the 1974 comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Billy Cosby and Harry Belafonte; two more Cosby films, Let’s Do It Again (1975) and A Piece of the Action (1977); and 1980’s Stir Crazy, featuring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. (He also helmed the 1990 vehicle Ghost Dad, one of the most terrific flops in movie history.)
 


As the decades continued, Poitier delivered largely forgettable roles on television and in cinema, but his iconic status had already been cemented in the American cultural canon.It took almost 40 years for a second Black actor to win the Best Actor prize, with Denzel Washington claiming the statue in 2002 for Training Day.Poitier was in the audience that night, too, having been bestowed an Honorary Oscar for his work in the industry inscribed with the words, “To Sidney Poitier, in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.”As Washington took the stage, Poitier looked on, beaming.“Forty years I’ve been chasing Sidney, they finally give it to me. What do they do? They give it to him the same night,” Washington joked. “I’ll always be chasing you, Sidney. I’ll always be following in your footsteps.”

This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.I’ve recently noticed a trend reemerge among celebrities and influencers that I can’t stop thinking about: unfollowing everyone on Instagram.Some refer to it as entering their Reputation era, a nod to Taylor Swift, who famously unfollowed everyone in 2017 and posted snakes on her feed to promote her post-cancellation album. Five years later, her following count still sits at zero. Other Gen Z celebs have also embraced the unfollow, such as Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. Then this week, YouTuber and influencer Emma Chamberlain, who has over 14 million followers, purged her Insta account to follow no one. Advertisement     It feels like a blue checkmark is no longer enough for celebrities to prove their social media power. Instead, it’s following zero people that elevates them to god level.During an interview on Capital Breakfast, a UK radio show, Swift explained that wiping her profile clean and unfollowing people was in protest to how the media monitored her every move via social media.“I’m starting to realize that if I didn’t wish one of my friends a happy birthday on Instagram, there would literally be articles saying like, ‘Unsquadded: She’s no longer friends with so-and-so!’ And I’d literally be at the person’s birthday party with them and because I hadn’t posted,” Swift said. “I kind of reject this idea that if you didn’t see it on the Internet it didn’t happen.""For Chamberlain, it might be a way for her to spend less time online — something she has been vocal about wanting to do. She’s already deleted her Twitter and TikTok accounts. Fans noticed and called it “queen behavior.""
 


After a few days at zero, Chamberlain started following one Insta account: her own coffee brand.The unfollow move makes sense for celebrities. With constant eyes on Rodrigo’s Instagram and when she would or wouldn’t unfollow her ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, unfollowing everyone probably eliminated a possible headline. There’s also the perceived power it gives these celebrities. No one is good enough for Beyoncé to follow; her count has been zero since day one. Even Oprah only follows three accounts for the companies she owns or does business with. Ed Sheeran follows his brand’s account and the restaurant he opened in 2019. Advertisement     I reached out to Anna Russett, a YouTuber and product specialist at YouTube, who unfollowed everyone on Instagram in 2018 after realizing she was following too many people she didn’t know. Plus, as a vlogger with more than 88,000 subscribers, she knew some of her fans would follow everyone she was following, including her boss or her nonpublic friends.“That was strange,” Russett told me. “Some people just want a way to be closer to your life in some way when you create content, and that was a couple of people’s ways of doing that.”She still has a finsta, which she uses to follow some influencers she likes, but unfollowing everyone has given her more agency, she said. Instead of someone’s post popping up on her phone, she has to seek it out, meaning she spends less time on the app.
 


For Russett, Swift, and Rodrigo, using Instagram as a creator rather than as a consumer isn’t that wild of an idea. Social media is a way for them to sell themselves and their art. But on Facebook, where someone has to be your friend to see your posts, unfriending everyone is almost like disappearing. Advertisement     Stephen, who declined to disclose his last name, told BuzzFeed News that after his grandmother died in October, he began to reevaluate whom he was sharing information with online.“I started to have a frustration about sharing parts of my life with all the strangers I’ve collected throughout the course of my life but not being able to share it with a close family member who’s no longer around,” he said.Stephen, who is 24, has been on Facebook for half of his life, which makes his skin crawl. So he deleted more than 1,000 Facebook friends, leaving only his brother and boyfriend. In a way, he was reinventing himself, but he realized there was a darker side to his actions.“I was trying to erase myself, for lack of a better phrasing of it,” Stephen said. “It really felt like I was trying to kill myself off of it in a way.”Unfriending everyone gave him some anxiety, so he slowly added close friends and family members back — but now that he has fewer Facebook friends, he’s on the website less.Chamberlain seems to want the same. When she deleted her TikTok, she said on her podcast that it was a “life-changing experience.”Maybe unfollowing everyone on Instagram is a way of forcing herself to use the app less, like how many people make a New Year’s resolution to cut down on their social media intake. Advertisement     “It seemed like TikTok kept me entertained in bed to the point where I would stay in bed so much longer,” she said. “Within the first few days of deleting TikTok, I stopped laying in bed so much because I would get so bored. It forced me to get up, and I felt like I was doing more chores.”Until there’s a way to mass unfollow people, it’s too much of a chore for me to unfollow more than 2,000 accounts. I would rather just keep scrolling.

WASHINGTON — Prosecutors say Anthony Williams of Michigan joined the mob that stormed the US Capitol. With federal charges pending a year later, Williams filed a request in court shortly after 2 p.m. on Thursday asking for permission to leave the country for a 10-day trip to Jamaica.Two hours later, the judge delivered her ruling: Absolutely not.In a one-paragraph order laced with disbelief that Williams would make such a request at all under the circumstances, US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell explained that Williams’ request not only was inappropriate given the status of his case but also that his timing was terrible. Advertisement     “This Court will not commemorate the one-year anniversary of this attack on the Capitol by granting defendant's request for non-essential foreign travel when he is awaiting judgment for his actions on that day,” Howell wrote.When and how people charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection can travel has been a fraught issue in these cases before. In February, Jenny Cudd of Texas asked for permission to go on a work-related bonding retreat to Mexico. The ask was not unheard of; it’s common for judges to allow defendants facing nonviolent offenses to travel if they’re complying with their pretrial release conditions. But Cudd’s request, the fact that the prosecutor didn’t oppose it, and the judge’s approval made her a lightning rod for criticism that the Justice Department and judges were treating alleged Capitol rioters with kid gloves.When Florida couple Dana Winn and Rachael Pert asked to appear by video for their December sentencing instead of traveling from their home state to Washington, DC, US District Judge Trevor McFadden rejected the request.“Defendants found the means to travel to Washington, D.C. to commit the crime to which they have pled guilty,” McFadden wrote at the time. “Defendants can therefore find the means to return to Washington, D.C. to be held accountable for this crime.”
 


Williams is facing a five-count indictment, including one felony charge for obstructing an official proceeding. According to his charging papers, the FBI received a tip that he had posted on Facebook about being at the Capitol on Jan. 6. After getting access to the account through a search warrant, the government alleged that it found videos and photos that showed him inside. In one video, the person identified as Williams talks about storming the building and pushing back against police officers. “We took this fucking building,” he says in the video. The FBI also pulled messages that he had allegedly posted, including, “Was proudest day of my life lol felt like the founding fathers were smiling down on us in that room.”Those words partly doomed Williams’ effort to get to Jamaica. He had been allowed to go home after he was charged and arrested in March. In his travel request, his lawyer wrote that he had been in a romantic relationship for “more than a year” and was hoping to meet his girlfriend’s family, who live in Negril, located in the western part of the country. He would leave in late January, stay for 10 days, and work at a local nonprofit during the visit.The pretrial services officer, who supervises Williams’ compliance with his pretrial release conditions, didn’t oppose the trip, but the prosecutor did.Howell began her order by recapping the request: “Defendant, while on pretrial release and facing charges including a serious felony offense, stemming from his alleged actions on January 6, 2021, wishes to leave the Michigan winter to spend ten days in the warmer climes of Jamaica to meet the family of a woman with whom defendant has been in a committed relationship for ‘more than a year.’”She continued: “Although such a meeting may be an important step in defendant's personal relationship, defendant surrendered his entitlement to unfettered international travel when, also ‘more than a year’ ago, on December 30, 2020, he allegedly announced his intent to ‘Storm the Swamp,’ and one week later, on January 6, 2021, followed through by joining a mob at the Capitol that, in his words, ‘took [that] fucking building,’ an event he allegedly viewed as the ‘proudest day of [his] life.’”The judge concluded with the denial, invoking the one-year anniversary of the Capitol attack.Williams is due to appear before Howell again on Jan. 21 for a hearing on the status of his case. His lawyer declined to comment.

A stockpile of as many as 1 million COVID-19 tests sat in a Florida warehouse and expired, Gov. Ron DeSantis admitted on Jan. 6 as the state and the rest of the country are facing a steep demand for tests and a surge of new infections.But rather than let the tests go unused, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed the state to extend the expiration date of the tests, allowing them to be used until March as the state, and the rest of the country, faces a surge of new COVID cases due to the Omicron variant. Advertisement     The governor's office had previously brushed off questions about the stockpile's expiration, but when asked during a press conference, the state's Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie admitted that somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million tests had expired at the end of the year.""We tried to get them out,"" Guthrie told reporters. ""But there was not a demand for it.""Yet last week, Floridians reportedly waited up to three hours to get a COVID-19 test as cases and potential exposures spiked due to the more infectious Omicron variant. And on Dec. 21, officials in the state's most populous county, Miami-Dade, reportedly asked state officials to send any available tests to meet the spiking demand.""We are asking that all possible tests that come through the state for distribution be allocated to Miami-Dade given the surge in demand in our community for testing options,"" a spokesperson for the county mayor's office told Local 10. Advertisement     In a letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, the FDA extended the expiration of the tests to 15 months due to Florida's ""ongoing stability studies."" The extension marks the second time Florida has requested an expiration date extension for that particular batch of tests.The tests, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Health said, were not at-home tests and must be administered by professionals.
 


DeSantis on Jan. 6 said tests were being sent out to local jurisdictions as requested. Demand for COVID tests had slowed down in September, when the tests in the stockpile were first set to expire, he added.""There was no withholding of anything,"" the governor told reporters.State officials at that time requested permission from federal health officials to extend the use of the tests for three more months, Guthrie said. That request was granted, but still the tests sat unused and expired between Dec. 26 and Dec. 30.Florida officials then requested another three-month extension to use the tests.""The thing is, if they're not authorized, if they're not accurate, we don't want to send inaccurate tests,"" DeSantis said.The existence of the unused tests became public when Florida agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried put out a statement about them, pointing out they were about to expire. Advertisement     ""Given the Governor's lack of transparency throughout this pandemic, there's no known public information about these tests or how soon they expire,"" she said on Dec. 30 in a statement. ""With omicron infections exploding throughout Florida, I beg of him to release these tests immediately to local counties and cities, and to stand up state-sponsored testing sites. To let these tests expire while Floridians anxiously wait for hours in testing lines is negligent at best, and heartless at worst.""Fried, a Democrat, is currently running for governor.DeSantis's office at first brushed off questions about the tests, with his spokesperson Christina Pushaw telling a local NBC 2 reporter that Fried's allegation was ""bizarre.""After DeSantis admitted the tests had expired, Pushaw then inaccurately tweeted that the tests had expired before the Omicron surge, leaving out that an extension of their use had been authorized.Fried, in turn, accused DeSantis and his office of lying and now attempting a cover-up.""The governor of the third largest state lied to you about COVID tests,"" she tweeted. ""When we caught him, he used your tax dollars to come after me for telling you the truth.""

Federal prosecutors say a key FBI informant in the alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan was a “double agent” who was “working against the interests of the government” by trying to destroy evidence and prevent arrests.The confidential informant, Stephen Robeson, played a central role in the investigation that led to the arrest of 14 men for allegedly participating in a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in October 2020. At the direction of his FBI handlers, Robeson reached out to potential targets, organized meetings, and paid travel expenses for people to attend such events. Advertisement     Now the government appears to be disowning its own operative, saying he deceived the FBI and at times actively aided targets of the investigation.Defendants have claimed that it was overzealous government informants, including Robeson, who hatched the alleged plot to kidnap a sitting governor. The defendants have denounced the case as entrapment and an example of “egregious overreaching,” claiming they never would have contemplated the purported crimes without the informants’ involvement.In a court filing Thursday, prosecutors said that Robeson violated the terms of his agreement with the FBI, including by possessing firearms despite having felony convictions, offering the use of “charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks,” and offering a drone to “aid in acts of domestic terrorism.”In addition, the filing said that Robeson failed to record “pertinent conversations and events,” didn’t tell his government handlers about other recordings he’d made, tried to delete recordings, and attempted to warn “at least one of the defendants shortly before their arrest” in October 2020. Advertisement     Last month, Robeson was charged with fraud in state court in Wisconsin. He was also charged last March with a gun crime in federal court to which he ultimately pleaded guilty, under a highly favorable plea deal that involves no jail time despite his multiple prior convictions. Despite that, the Justice Department has remained largely silent on his activities in the Michigan investigation, not even confirming his role as an informant — until now.The prosecutors’ statements may have significant implications. Defense attorneys have been trying to get Robeson’s communications admitted as evidence, because they want to show that instead of just observing and informing on the accused, he pushed them into a plot they would never otherwise have come up with or agreed to. To that end, the lawyers last month identified dozens of statements by Robeson they hope to bring up during the trial, which is scheduled to begin March 8 in Grand Rapids federal court.The government’s response, laid out in the new filing, has been to disavow Robeson entirely. In the filing, they call him “an unreliable declarant” — legal speak for a liar — and say that his statements cannot be used as evidence.Robeson’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Attorneys for several of the defendants also declined to comment.Defendants have also sought to introduce communications between FBI agents and their informants, saying they help prove that the government planted specific ideas about violence in their heads. Advertisement     For example, in August 2020, agent Jayson Chambers wrote to an informant known as Dan: “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”But in Thursday’s filing, prosecutors said that any statements made by the agents that the government has not specifically cited in search warrants, charging documents, or other formal court filings should not be admitted in court. Although they were working for the FBI on an active investigation at the time they uttered those words, prosecutors say they were “the agents’ own statements and not the statements of the United States government.”The Justice Department has previously stated its intentions to keep those agents off the stand.Chambers was removed from the witness list five days after BuzzFeed News reported that he had incorporated a security business and that an online troll linked to the business had been tweeting about the case before it became public. Another agent has been accused of perjury in a separate case.Defense attorneys, however, are expected to try to call both of them, as well as Robeson, and to question them before the jury about their actions in the investigation.Jessica Garrison contributed to this report.

As millions of COVID cases spread across the US, teachers and parents have been thrown into chaos as some school districts revert to remote learning, leading to rising tensions as families try to limit exposing loved ones to the virus.Without universal childcare in the US, many parents rely on schools and are exhausted by the prospect of balancing at-home learning responsibilities on top of careers or other caregiving. Teachers, meanwhile, fear they can’t provide effective instruction with so many students either at home with illness or kept from schools by their parents. Advertisement     And then there’s the disarray for teachers who are also parents, a group that is struggling to protect the health of their students and that of their own children. BuzzFeed News spoke to multiple teachers who are parents, many of whom have made the difficult choice to keep children home given how much the coronavirus is spreading in schools — a frustrating move for educators who believe that in-person learning is always better.Some are taking lessons home for their kids or making them up independently while also leading their classes and volunteering free time to support unions. They’re more burned out than ever and afraid they’ll be the ones to bring home the virus.“It feels unfair,” said Andrea Keller, a teacher at PS 96 in the Bronx and a parent of 4-year-old twins. “We, as teachers, have to sacrifice the health of our own children to accommodate other people’s children.”Keller used one of her sick days Wednesday to stay home with one of her children who has croup, a side effect of COVID that’s essentially an infection of the upper airway, but she said her classroom was practically empty that day anyway. In addition to her own family, Keller said nearly half her students tested positive for COVID over the holiday break. Advertisement     Her school’s attendance has been lagging since classes resumed Jan. 3, Keller said, and for people like her who are teachers and parents, they face additional complexity as the new year begins — teachers don’t want to go to work at the expense of their family’s safety.“I’m just biding time until I can get a good lesson or a good amount of kids,” Keller said. “The school has to open so other people can have free childcare, but now my kid is sick because I went to school and I brought home the virus. And now I have to stay home and lose a sick day so that you can send your kid to school for babysitting because they’re not getting an education right now.”For teachers who are parents like Keller, she said it feels like the decision is made without any concern for what teaching in person would risk for her own children, who are too young to be vaccinated against COVID.“It starts the domino effect of now, you insist that your kids have in-person schooling, so now I have to show up to teach your kids, but that doesn't address my own children and their needs,” Keller said.School districts in cities including Pittsburgh, Detroit, St. Louis, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have opted for temporary virtual learning, citing health and safety concerns.Parents across the country responded with outrage and a sense of hopelessness at the prospect of once again balancing full-time work or childcare with homeschooling — and their reactions reflect a situation in which there are few good options. But the worst option, experts say, is to further hollow the divide between parents and teachers. Advertisement     “I don’t think we want to set up or exacerbate potential conflict between parents and teachers, when so many parents are teachers as well,” said Dan Ehlke, associate professor of health policy at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health.The pandemic has stressed the issue of inaccessible childcare in the US, Ehlke added. A side effect of this is tension between teachers unions and parents. In Chicago, students missed a second day of school Thursday after the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and school administrators failed to reach an agreement. Some Chicago Public School parents responded to the union’s vote to switch to remote with frustration, saying they were not prepared and couldn’t afford to miss work.“I don’t think it’s easy for anyone involved in this,” said Lori Koziana, a teacher at Mather High School in Chicago who told BuzzFeed News she was home sick with COVID. “I just want us to find a middle.”
 


Koziana said she isolated for a week and tested negative before returning to classes on Monday, when 32 of her students were absent (CPS ceased testing students before they came into buildings).“I go to great lengths to make sure I’m healthy,” Koziana said, adding that she distances from her own students and only walks in the school’s hallways during specific low-traffic periods of the day.But by Wednesday she had the virus.“It’s very difficult at the high school level to social distance in any meaningful way when you have thousands of kids in hallways moving from one class to the next,” she said, adding that she supports the union’s vote for a temporary switch to remote learning to allow local healthcare systems to catch up with demand.Her sons, one a high school sophomore, the other a senior, are isolating at their father’s house, she said, but one of them is developmentally delayed and the other is severely immunocompromised. Remote learning isn’t an option for CPS students, so she has to send them back to school as soon as their isolation ends or they won’t keep up.“A lot of these considerations are getting intertwined with labor relations,” Ehlke told BuzzFeed News, adding that it's “atrocious” some districts justify labor-related decisions like salary cuts or benefits changes for teachers who opt to work from home for reasons involving the pandemic.Ehlke and his wife are teachers and parents of three children, and he said it's easy to have conflict within families like his when educators must prioritize other kids’ health over that of their own. Not to mention the distraction and burnout caused by exhausting disagreement over COVID responses, he said, which has set up districts for major teacher shortages across the country, even before Omicron hit.Because the American school system is so localized, the experience for parents who are teachers varies from place to place, he said. With each town making its own COVID protocol, it's difficult for teachers who are parents to find a situation that works for their careers and families. For example, a teacher may work in one district and send their child to school in another — but what happens when their own child goes remote and they have to go to work in person? Or when they bring COVID home to their unvaccinated children?
 


“That’s where you see particular conflict,” Ehlke said.One solution, Keller said, would be to implement more restrictive in-person measures. For example, her classroom roster has nearly doubled compared to last year, the school has stopped staggering when kids eat, and students aren’t tested as they enter the building.“It would be helpful if we could just admit that right now this variant is super contagious and is spreading in schools,” Keller said. “Nobody wants to talk about that.”A one-size-fits-all policy won’t work, Ehlke said, but he hopes multiple districts could coordinate on a regional or county basis to make decisions and avoid “unnecessary chaos.”“I think this is an artificial divide,” Ehlke said of the tension between teachers and parents. “I think we need to make it clear that we are all in this together.”“It’s not an us versus them thing,” said Takiah Ogunlusi, an eighth-grade teacher in Griffin, Georgia. “That’s a big part of the conversation that’s missing: People don’t realize we [teachers] have children too.”Ogunlusi added it’s because she agrees with other parents that she chose to send her 11-year-old to in-person classes, but she has anxiety her oldest child will infect her other kids who are too young to be vaccinated.“The reality of the situation is that kids have contracted the virus over break,” Ogunlusi said. “At the very least, there should be a true remote option.” Advertisement     
 


Andrea Castellano, a parent who teaches in Brooklyn, also decided to keep her fifth-grader and eighth-grader home in Queens after the holidays. More than half of her third-grade class has been absent since classes resumed Jan. 3, and she’s just trying to get students to meet basic mental and physical wellness so they can focus on their academic achievement.Pitting teachers against parents is a conversation only some communities can afford, she said, because families of color have been disproportionately affected by COVID. Demanding that schools stay open ignores the potential effects on teachers and parents of color, too.“Those are the people that have also kept their children in remote as long as possible, and who are reluctant to send them back right now,” she said.Her children’s father has COVID right now and is isolated, so Castellano is gripped by concern that if they get sick, it will be because she brought the virus home from work.“The guilt I [would] have,” she said. “I stood outside my door yesterday. And I was like, ‘I don't want to go inside because I'm scared to give it to them.’”

On the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection, President Joe Biden gave a speech condemning former president Donald Trump for his role in inciting violence and undermining democracy, a striking departure for the president who has spent his first year in office avoiding dwelling on his predecessor.Biden’s speech, delivered on Capitol Hill, carefully avoided naming the former president but focused on keeping the record straight on the violent pro-Trump insurrection and the threat to American democracy that Republicans have stoked in past years. Yet it was clear who he was talking about. He repeatedly brought up the “former president” and the lies he told before, during, and since the 2020 presidential election to try to undermine the results. It was Biden’s clearest and most prolonged denunciation of Trump from the executive office. Advertisement     “His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution. He cannot accept that he lost,” Biden said. “For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election, he tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol.”His decision to focus on the former president comes as Democrats weigh whether anti-Trump messaging could sink them in the midterms and as they try to outline what their party stands for instead of only what they stand against. Ultimately, Biden’s (accurate) portrayal of Trump was an apparent shift to address the ongoing threats to democracy, including restrictive voting laws that ultimately undermine elections across the board.Biden’s tiptoe around actually naming Trump was obvious. The president himself addressed the decision. “I did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the president,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked why he didn't say Trump's name. ""It's way beyond that.”In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack, Trump called Biden’s speech “political theater” and a “distraction.”""It looks like he saw the speech. I guess that's good news. Maybe he learned something about what it looks like to meet the moment in the country,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in response to Trump’s statement during the press briefing Thursday. Advertisement     Psaki did not immediately respond to an inquiry by BuzzFeed News about some of the thinking around the speech, including whether Biden might talk about Trump more as the midterms approach.""Biden's right. This is a crisis in democracy,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a progressive consultant with Left Flank Strategies. “Coming up with an actual plan to solve it, which we don't have a ton of time left before the midterm elections, I think that's like a really crucial thing that a lot of people, especially progressives, feel a lot of urgency about."" He added that Biden’s most direct attempt to hold Trump accountable came as “a welcome development.”Perhaps no instance best encapsulates how striking it is for Biden to focus a speech so heavily on Trump than a comment he made last month — “I don’t think about the former president” — when asked about the report that Trump tested positive for COVID before a September 2020 debate.Biden has previously addressed Trump on certain matters. In December, he pointed out that Trump had taken a COVID-19 booster shot — ""one of the few things he and I agree on"" — before going on to condemn ""companies and personalities"" peddling lies about the pandemic. He obviously also struck a direct contrast on the campaign trail not only in his own election but in other contests since.""You can't tell the story of Jan. 6 without talking about the former president,” said Addisu Demise, an Oakland-based Democratic strategist. “[Trump] invited people to Washington, incited them to violence, I would say, and in my mind it would be a denial of history to erase him from the day.” Advertisement     Demise said he doesn't expect Biden's focus on Trump to carry into the coming weeks and months as Democrats prepare for the midterms and the next presidential election, because it would distract from talking about his own agenda and achievements. But rather, he said, it would have been ""malpractice"" not to talk about Trump's role in the attempted insurrection on its anniversary.Looking at the bigger picture, though, Demise said it wouldn't make sense for Biden to rag on Trump, who, despite his ongoing political pull, should not be the focus of this presidency.""He was elected in large part to turn the page on the Trump era. And if he continues to focus on that, it takes him away from his job, which is to focus not on yesterday, but on tomorrow,"" Demise said.Democrats have spent a lot of time working to keep the record straight on the events of Jan. 6 against efforts by Republicans to rewrite history, and Biden’s speech was true to that. From the start, Democrats built a detailed case illustrating Trump’s role in inciting the violence, including during the impeachment trial last year — which he was acquitted of by Republicans. Their efforts continue today: One of the commemorative events Democrats are hosting on the anniversary of the insurrection is a moderated discussion featuring the Democratic leaders of each chamber of Congress and renowned historians.""I think using this anniversary to stand up for our country, our ideals, and what we believe in as a nation is critical,” said Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist and former Biden adviser. “The scars of that day still haven't healed for so many, and part of the way we recover as a country is to ensure that our democracy stands.""

WASHINGTON — Democrats lined up to greet former vice president Dick Cheney in the House chamber Thursday, a rare moment of outreach to a onetime party villain who is now one of the few high-profile Republicans to fully acknowledge what happened before and during last year's fatal Capitol riots.His daughter Rep. Liz Cheney is under attack by her own party as she continues to speak out against former president Donald Trump’s false claims of election fraud. Advertisement     House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro was one of several Democrats to pay their respect to the former vice president during a short procedural session in Congress marking the anniversary of the Capitol attack.“I believe he cares deeply about this country,” DeLauro told BuzzFeed News. “We have different views on issues. I think that's important that he's here. I think it speaks to the strength of the institution and the strength of our democracy.” ​“This isn't about partisanship,” she said. “This is about, you know, what this citadel of democracy represents, for him, for me, for Liz Cheney, for all of us here.”Reps. Lizzie Fletcher, David Cicilline, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Eric Swalwell also spoke to Dick Cheney.“In this fight, he’s an ally,” Swalwell said later. “And this fight, for the soul of America, is the only one that matters.”The former vice president, member of Congress, cabinet secretary, and White House official has not exactly been beloved by Democrats over the last half-century. Throughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Cheney was portrayed by Democrats in and out of Congress as the dark force driving the president and the functional Republican power center, from the Iraq War to any number of domestic political fights. But Cheney, and his now out-of-style brand of neoconservatism, is not aligned with where the party is today. Advertisement     The current Republican Party leadership, he told reporters Thursday, is “not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years.”The House of Representatives did not have scheduled votes Thursday, and many members have stayed out of DC this week. Some House Democrats served food to US Capitol Police officers and campus staff to thank them for their actions one year ago. But Republicans in particular were not eager to be at the Capitol for the first anniversary of the insurrection, where they inevitably would have had to face renewed questions about the actions party leaders took and conspiracies Trump hawked that inspired hundreds to riot.Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz are scheduled to hold a public response to the anniversary, after Trump canceled a press conference with the same agenda. Like other House Republicans, Greene and Gaetz skipped the ceremonial events Democrats held. They instead appeared on Steve Bannon’s War Room.“We’re ashamed of nothing. We’re proud of the work we did on Jan. 6 and we’re actually going to walk the grounds that patriotic Americans walked from the White House to the Capitol,” Gaetz said on the program. The two promised to make the same “legitimate arguments about election integrity” at Thursday’s press conference.Cheney was not the only Democratic villain of the early 2000s to make an unusual reappearance for the insurrection anniversary. Karl Rove, for years Bush’s top political adviser, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed condemning the riot “apologists” in the Republican Party for not being honest about what happened on Jan. 6. “If Democrats had done what some Trump supporters did on that violent Jan. 6, Republicans would have criticized them mercilessly and been right to do so,” he wrote. Advertisement     Republicans, instead, have been most merciless with Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee investigating the insurrection and a prime political target of Trump’s in this year’s elections. Cheney was removed from a Republican leadership position last year after voting for Trump’s impeachment.“My daughter can take care of herself,” the former vice president told reporters.

Like most people on Jan. 6, 2021, I was glued to my screen. I watched as the news of the riots at the Capitol played out on Twitter, on TV, in my group chats, and in my work Slack. The last year has been about understanding how the destructive event happened, why, and what happens next.Cynthia Rivera has been the exhibitions manager at the Bronx Documentary Center for eight and a half years. Throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, she worked with photographers around the country on exhibitions related to issues that were central to the narrative in those four years — immigration, the climate crisis, and the “end of truth.” For Rivera, everything seemed connected: “We asked ourselves the question, is this a one-time event or is this a segue into something much bigger, much more chaotic, and the truth of what our democracy has become?” Advertisement  On Jan. 6, as a mob attacked the Capitol and assaulted police officers, some photojournalists who had planned on covering Trump’s morning rally realized they were in for much more. Many photographers were there for the Capitol riot. No one knew exactly what was going to happen or that people were going to storm the building, but they had gotten word that something might go down that day. ""The BDC spent a lot of time analyzing Trump's presidency, leading up to and during,” Rivera said. “It was a moment in history that seemed unreal, but we could also understand why this was happening and what led up to this moment.”Christopher Lee was in Washington that day photographing for Time magazine. ""There were a lot of photojournalists who were following the groundswell of conspiracy and anger. For me, it wasn't surprising, but it was shocking,"" he said. ""For a person who has a lot of experience covering traumatic events abroad and the violence that people can inflict on each other, I had the privilege of stepping away from that when it got too dangerous or difficult. As a native Texan and someone who lives and works in Texas, that quiet chaos and that anxiety really followed me back home [after Jan. 6]."" According to the Department of Justice, Texas constituted the second-highest number of people who were charged that day.“It wasn't until a year after the insurrection, of information unraveling, that we were able to have a full view of what happened that day,” Rivera said.We look at the exhibit, which opens in the Bronx later this month, one year after the riots.

WASHINGTON — Federal charges for the Jan. 6 insurrection began pouring in the day after the attack and haven’t stopped. The case count passed 700 just before the end of 2021. BuzzFeed News has tracked every case filed. One year in, here’s where the prosecution effort stands.The basics
 


The sprawling prosecution effort has been unprecedented in its scope. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday presented the latest statistics trying to convey the massive scale: More than 5,000 subpoenas and search warrants. Nearly 2,000 seized phones and other devices. More than 300,000 tips from the public. More than 20,000 hours of video footage. The government has routinely asked for extensions to the normal deadlines that apply to criminal cases, citing the scale of the prosecution effort and delays in developing a system to manage the massive amount of evidence.Judges and defense lawyers have at times pushed back, particularly in cases where alleged rioters were held in jail after their arrest. But for the most part, judges have allowed longer time frames. Some of the earliest cases are only just starting to wrap up. Mark Leffingwell of Seattle was the first person to face federal charges; he was arrested at the Capitol after punching two police officers. He entered a guilty plea in late October and is due to be sentenced on Feb. 10.New cases are still being filed, some rooted in tips sent to the FBI right after the attack. Take defendant Michael Oliveras of New Jersey. On Jan. 8, 2021, an anonymous tip came in about a Parler user who’d posted about being at the Capitol during the riot. The FBI matched the Parler account to a phone number linked to Oliveras. Citing that and other evidence, a prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against him on Dec. 8 — 11 months after the first tip.
 


Justice Department officials said in the days that followed the insurrection that they were prepared to prosecute anyone who committed a crime on Jan. 6. In a speech marking the first anniversary this week, Garland said the DOJ was still “committed to holding all Jan. 6 perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law” — “there is no higher priority,” he said. The fact that most people who stormed the Capitol were allowed to leave and scatter across the country complicated that effort, but Garland said there was no deadline or case count milestone when they’d wind down.The government’s position is that between 2,000 and 2,500 people went inside the Capitol. That number doesn’t include people who assaulted police officers or members of the media outside. Prosecutors haven’t shown much appetite so far for charging people who crossed police barriers onto the restricted Capitol grounds but didn’t go inside or commit other crimes, although they have set precedent for that; Infowars host Owen Shroyer is being charged for being in a restricted area outdoors. On Jan. 6, Shroyer was with Infowars founder and right-wing activist Alex Jones, who hasn’t been charged.
 


The first plea deal became public in April, when heavy metal musician Jon Schaffer of Indiana pleaded guilty to two felonies for obstructing an official proceeding and going into the Capitol with a weapon (a can of bear spray). Schaffer had been a member of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing group that’s featured prominently in the government’s exploration of ties between extremist organizations and the insurrection. He agreed to cooperate and hasn’t been sentenced yet.The pace of guilty pleas has picked up since the summer. Prosecutors focused early plea deal offers on defendants they’d charged solely with misdemeanor crimes from the start; 150 of the 174 guilty pleas have been for those less serious categories of crimes, such as illegally being in the Capitol and parading. In 11 cases, prosecutors have agreed to let a defendant charged with a felony plead down to a misdemeanor.The US attorney’s office has also locked down guilty pleas from defendants in several high-profile cases involving more serious crimes: Jacob Chansley of Arizona, previously referred to as the “QAnon shaman,” who was photographed posing shirtless and wearing horns on the Senate floor, was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to obstruction. Four other members of the Oath Keepers are cooperating after pleading guilty to conspiracy. Former Olympic athlete Klete Keller is potentially facing two years in prison.
 


Two defendants opted to plead guilty to the full slate of crimes they were charged with instead of making a deal with prosecutors. Pleading guilty often comes with the benefit of having charges dropped, but defendants give up certain rights and may decide they don’t want to work with the government. Antionne Brodnax, a Virginia-based rapper known as Bugzie the Don, pleaded guilty to a set of misdemeanors for illegally going into the Capitol. He told the FBI he was filming a music video and used a photo of himself sitting on a SWAT vehicle in front of the Capitol as the cover of an album titled The Capital. Matthew Perna of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty to a felony for obstructing Congress as well as misdemeanor counts; in a video filmed on Jan. 6, he said: ""lt's not over, trust me. The purpose of today was to expose Pence as a traitor."" Their respective lawyers did not return requests for comment.
 


Probation. Incarceration. Home detention. Financial penalties. Community service. Social media limits. The sentences handed down so far have largely reflected the nature of the crimes featured in the first wave of plea deals — minimal to no jail time for low-level misdemeanor offenses. Even in misdemeanor cases, there’s a lack of consensus among judges about what just punishment looks like for joining an insurrection. The small number of rioters who pleaded guilty to more serious crimes, like assaulting police and obstructing Congress, stared down far more time behind bars — setting the stage for higher-stakes sentencing hearings this year as more felony cases slowly start to resolve. Advertisement  
 


The first sentence to cross the five-year mark went to Robert Palmer of Florida, who pleaded guilty to repeatedly attacking police outside the Capitol using a fire extinguisher and a wooden plank. His plea agreement estimated less prison time on the table if he got credit for accepting responsibility. But at his Dec. 17 sentencing, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed with prosecutors that he’d blown up that opportunity by posting a fundraising pitch online after entering his guilty plea that suggested that he’d acted in self-defense; that narrative was false, Palmer admitted to the judge.
 


Once incarceration is off the table, what makes for a harsher or lighter sentence can be up for debate. Probation means resuming normal life with some conditions and restrictions. Danielle Doyle, whose former coworker at the Oklahoma City Thunder reported her to the FBI, pleaded guilty to the parading misdemeanor and received the shortest period of probation to date — two months. Most probation terms have ranged from one to three years. US District Judge Trevor McFadden also ordered Doyle to pay a $3,000 fine, a penalty that the government hadn’t asked for. Several judges have added financial consequences in the mix, with some saying they thought it might be more effective than a short stint in jail to make rioters feel some “hurt,” in the words of one judge.
 


As part of nearly every plea deal entered to date, defendants are agreeing to pay restitution to the feds — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and between $1,000 and $2,000 for a felony plea. Any fine levied by a judge as part of a sentence is on top of that. Advertisement  
 


The government’s cooperators include the four members of the Oath Keepers conspiracy case and Schaffer, Matthew Greene of New York, charged in one of the Proud Boys conspiracy cases, Gina Bisignano, a Beverly Hills salon owner who recorded video of her experience entering the Capitol, Keller, the former Olympian, and Josiah Colt of Idaho, who traveled to DC with several codefendants whose cases are pending. Another 101 defendants who took plea deals also agreed to a type of partial cooperation: submitting for a final interview or giving investigators a last look at their social media posts and any photos or videos on their phones.
 


Adam Johnson of Florida was captured in a viral photo smiling and waving as he carried a lectern with the speaker of the House’s seal through the rotunda. But his guilty plea was notable for other reasons. Prosecutors learned that Johnson had expressed plans to write a book about his experience at the Capitol — in the government’s words, to “potentially profit off his illegal conduct on January 6, 2021.” He became the first defendant who had to agree to a provision in his deal that he would give the feds any money he earned from content he produced related to Jan. 6 for five years. Advertisement  
 


Chansley is one of three defendants pursuing appeals of their sentences after pleading guilty. The others are Scott Fairlamb, a New Jersey man sentenced to 44 months in prison after he admitted to punching a police officer in the head, and Rasha Abual-Ragheb, also of New Jersey, who was sentenced to three years of probation and two months of home detention after pleading guilty to the parading misdemeanor. Plea deals significantly restrict a defendant’s ability to appeal; one of the only arguments they’re allowed to raise is that their lawyer was ineffective. All three cases are in the early stages of the appeal process.The crimes
 


Weapons that prosecutors say rioters brought with them or improvised, and in some cases used on police: guns, knives, bats, chemicals, stolen police gear, flagpoles, a “Trump 2020” sign, pieces of metal and wood, crutches, a skateboard, stun devices, a crowbar, and a firecracker.
 


Rioters engaged in violent clashes throughout the afternoon with officers from the US Capitol Police, the DC police force, and other federal agencies who responded to the scene. Police body camera videos made public as part of the prosecutions have provided harrowing first-person footage of the physical and verbal assaults on officers that day. The US attorney’s office has put the number of cases involving allegations of attacking or interfering with officers at more than 225, including those in which defendants are charged with the broader offense of civil disorder.
 


The assault on the Capitol was a mob event, but the overwhelming majority of defendants are being prosecuted as individuals. In a few dozen cases, however, prosecutors have presented evidence alleging that clusters of rioters planned to take action to disrupt Congress’s certification of the election. In addition to the Oath Keepers conspiracy case, which has steadily added more defendants over the past year, there are conspiracy cases involving purported members of other far-right groups, including the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters.
 


On Jan. 12, Michael Sherwin, then the acting US attorney in Washington, told reporters that his office had created strike teams to build cases involving more serious crimes related to the insurrection, including seditious conspiracy. But no one has been charged yet with sedition or the separate offense of insurrection; both are rarely brought charges, and the government would almost certainly face legal challenges to their use. Nearly 300 people have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding, a felony that can carry significant prison time.
 


The FBI continues to search for suspects in connection with pipe bombs found midday on Jan. 6 outside the respective headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee. The feds have offered a $100,000 reward for information that leads to an identification and have repeatedly promoted surveillance footage of a person seen wearing a sweatshirt and carrying a bag the night before.
 


Charging papers are full of social media posts and other alleged statements by defendants denouncing former vice president Mike Pence for what they believed was his betrayal of former president Donald Trump. But some of the most violent language was reserved for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Charging papers describe alleged rioters asking where they could find Pelosi or bragging later about going into her office. In the case of Pauline Bauer of Pennsylvania, prosecutors said she was captured on a police body camera saying words to the effect of, ""Bring Nancy Pelosi out here now. We want to hang that fucking bitch.” Steven Billingsley of Ohio was allegedly recorded on video saying, “No, we do want to hurt Pelosi. I do. Yeah, I would hang her from that big— You see that tree over there? We'd put a rope and hang her.” Richard Barnett of Arkansas was photographed with a foot on a desk in Pelosi’s office, and left a handwritten note that read, “Hey Nancy Bigo was here biotch [sic].”
 


The most common felonies are for obstructing an official proceeding, which carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, and assaulting police, which carries varying maximum penalties — as little as 1 year or as much as 20 years — depending on the extent of the violence, whether a weapon was used, or if other felony crimes were involved.
 


The vast majority of defendants are facing the same four base misdemeanor charges: illegally entering a restricted area, disorderly conduct in a restricted area, disorderly conduct in the Capitol, and parading or demonstrating in the Capitol. The first two counts carry up to a year behind bars, and the second two have maximum sentences of six months incarceration.The logistics
 


The federal district court in Washington has marshaled all of its resources to handle the flood of Capitol riot prosecutions, spreading the hundreds of cases across all of the active judges as well as senior judges (judges who are semiretired and can take lower caseloads). The latest available court statistics show that by September 2021, the number of new criminal cases filed in DC over the previous year had gone up by 83.9% compared to the year leading up to September 2020. President Joe Biden’s two nominees to the DC district court so far, Judges Florence Pan and Jia Cobb, were confirmed in the fall and have slowly started taking on cases.
 


Fights over which defendants should stay in jail after being arrested offered early perspective on how prosecutors were assessing the ongoing danger posed by alleged rioters and how judges were thinking about these cases. Some prominent conservatives, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have described incarcerated defendants as “political prisoners,” but the majority of people in pretrial detention are charged with assaulting police. The rest are either facing other serious felony charges, had their bond revoked for violating release conditions, or are in custody on unrelated criminal charges. Advertisement     
 


Evan Neumann, charged with assaulting police at the Capitol, fled the United States and is seeking asylum in Belarus. Michael Adams of Virginia, charged with misdemeanors for going into the Capitol, was arrested in April and released while his case was pending. He failed to appear for a July status hearing, however, and the judge issued a bench warrant for his arrest; he was also facing a warrant as of May for an unrelated offense in Virginia. His location remains unknown, according to his lawyer. A federal grand jury returned an indictment in July charging Jonathan Pollock of Florida with multiple counts of assaulting police at the Capitol; he has not been arrested.
 


On June 1, a prosecutor filed a notice in court that they were dropping charges filed in January against Christopher Kelly of New York. To support the original complaint, the FBI presented information provided by a confidential source about Facebook messages purportedly sent by Kelly that suggested he’d gone into the Capitol. A search warrant for the Facebook account yielded messages about being at the Capitol; charging papers against Kelly also featured two photos of a person identified as Kelly standing outside. A few months later, it appeared the government had revisited the strength of the evidence. In dismissing the case, the prosecutor wrote: “[U]pon reflection of the facts currently known to the government, the government believes that dismissal without prejudice at this time serves the interests of justice.” Kelly’s lawyer told BuzzFeed News in an email that his client “never entered the Capitol building at any time. This was completely contrary to the charges he faced so the Government had to dismiss.”
 


No defendant has succeeded yet in convincing a judge to toss out the charges against them. In a series of long-awaited decisions in December, five judges presiding over six different cases — including two conspiracy cases involving members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, and one involving a person charged with bringing a firearm to the Capitol — rejected legal challenges to the government’s decision to bring the felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding in connection with the events of Jan. 6. These rulings came from a collection of judges whose pathways to the bench were politically diverse: two were nominated by Trump and the other three by former president Barack Obama. (Two defendants have died while their cases were pending.) Advertisement     
 


No one charged in connection with Jan. 6 has gone to trial yet, but dates are on the calendar in several dozen cases, including the Oath Keepers conspiracy case. Two defendants are set for trial as early as February: Robert Gieswein of Colorado, who is charged with repeatedly assaulting police with chemical spray and wielding a baseball bat as he made his way to the Capitol, and Guy Reffitt of Texas, who is charged with bringing a handgun to the Capitol.
 


Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House of Representatives for inciting the insurrection, but he was acquitted in February after a trial in the Senate. He hasn’t faced criminal charges. Hoping to find some other legal route to hold him accountable, Democrats in Congress and police officers who responded to the riots have filed civil lawsuits, arguing that he conspired to interfere with the certification of the election and that he’s liable for the physical and emotional injuries they sustained. A judge is set to hear arguments on Jan. 10 on motions filed by Trump’s initial push to get three of these cases tossed out. ●

What if, later today, you found a pipe bomb outside? And what if the bomb were real, not some hoax or mistake? And what if the bomb had been there for hours — maybe you’d cut through an alley and walked right near it, or maybe you’d even passed the bomber with your dog on a normal night on your own street, and not even known that explosives were inches away from your body?What if the bomb was outside your office, and there was another one, at the office up the street?What if, in the absence of resolution, the only reasonable conclusion is that the bomb was meant for you?That’s exactly a situation that’s unfolded in Washington. For four months, the FBI and reporters have posted silent, eerie, looping security footage of an “unknown individual” in a hoodie and Nike Air Max Speed Turfs, walking the nighttime streets of Capitol Hill — in an alley, then out, stopping, then gone. Authorities believe this person placed pipe bombs at both the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5. There are urgent ads with grainy screengrabs of the person around the city asking for information, and escalating rewards alongside direct-to-camera appeals. “No arrests have been made,” Washington police Chief Robert Contee said Wednesday during a congressional hearing. “No suspects have been identified.” Advertisement  One Democrat described every job she’d ever had as preparing her for different points of her life and career, with an exception. “I don’t think anyone at the DNC would tell you that they were prepared to be a target,” she said. “It was, frankly... No one can prepare you for that.”At midday on Jan. 6, a woman running an errand happened to spot what looked like a bomb outside the RNC and told the building’s security guards. “Holy shit, it is a bomb,” she overheard one shout.
 


“I'll never forget this as long as I live,” a Republican official said in a recent interview. He’d been walking into a meeting in Florida, where the committee was holding events, and received a call from the party’s operations head, even before the cops arrived. “Hey.” A pause. “We have to evacuate the building. I'm letting you know. It’s currently happening. There was a device found outside.” Advertisement  “I was like, ‘OK. Do we know anything about it yet?’”“It’s definitely a bomb.”“I’m trying to wrap my head around this — like, maybe he’s wrong!”In Washington, waves of police and federal officials descended on the RNC: the bomb squad, the FBI, dogs, everything. They evacuated the entire block, including the few dozen Republican staffers there that day. At that point on Jan. 6, a person waiting outside the buildings said, people were still getting off the Metro and walking around with kids in strollers, just a few blocks away from the east side of the Capitol. Then, watching it all unfold, she noticed something strange: “sirens going past us instead of toward us.”The rally to pressure Congress into overturning Donald Trump’s election defeat had become a mob, barreling into and past police barricades — broadcast in real time, blood spilling on the white steps — as senators spoke inside the Capitol about certifying the results. This is the forward-rewind unfolding of the insurrection: making sense of the entire situation took hours, then deepened with days, and is still hard to process in full. The cop getting crushed in the doorway, the crowd chanting “hang Mike Pence,” the rioters beating another cop with Americans flags, the video of lawmakers hustling toward elevators. As the woman waiting outside the RNC that day put it, “Only in retrospect did you place yourself in time.”
 


That afternoon, they'd locate a second bomb at the DNC, the police would evacuate some of the congressional office buildings, the authorities would detonate the bombs, the media would begin reporting about the devices. The Democrat said she’d actually heard that the bomb was really a bomb from the news — nearly everyone was working remotely because of the pandemic, and the day was chaotic. It had begun differently, busily: Democrats were celebrating Georgia senate wins the night before and working on Merrick Garland’s nomination that day.“I remember hearing from CNN and others, I think CNN was reporting it as breaking news that these were actual pipe bombs,” the Democrat said. “It was shocking when it was an actual bomb.”One way of considering the party committees is as a barometer of political health in American society: It’s not good. Over the last half-decade, they’ve become places where you might experience conspiracy theories, real email hacks, and finally, actual bombs. And you don’t have to particularly like the RNC or DNC to not want the people who work there to die in an explosion. If you talk to some political operatives — and this is a sample of just a few people, not everyone — you may find either a wearied acceptance or real anxiety. “You learn how to deal with them, and that sounds like a terrible thing, but you communicate, you stay in contact with the security officials,” the Democrat said about “suspicious packages” and threats, and the way it can be complicated and time-consuming to fully understand what’s going on. But, she also said, “something just this scary hasn’t happened to us where we had a real bomb outside of the building.”After a decade that included the WikiLeaks nightmare in 2016 and congressional baseball shooting in 2017, many political entities have added all manner of security protocol, both digital and physical. Only weeks before Jan. 6, the RNC upgraded its security cameras; some of the first images of the bomb suspect came from their footage. These days, they also have a system that can blast emergency alerts to employees simultaneously three different ways, as in: “RNC important message: Capitol Police are investigating a security concern near RNC headquarters in DC. Please remain away from the building.” Advertisement  “Is that now?” one of the Republicans said recently when it was read to him.That was the first alert the party sent on Jan. 6 at 1:32 p.m., as police and operations personnel cleared the building.The Democrat said she experienced the strange displacement of not being physically near colleagues because of the pandemic, which on the one hand, was good, given the nature of the problem. On the other, “We weren’t together, and we haven't been together for about a year now, right?”
 


There still is no way of knowing if the explosives had anything to do with the attack on the Capitol, or if it was a horrific coincidence; there aren’t any known suspects. There has, however, been an effort to minimize the chaos of the day. Since January, Trump has said little about the violence or the threat of more on Jan. 6 — including the bombs — all of it directed toward lawmakers, police officers, or fellow citizens. He still sends statements about how the election was stolen from him and has remarked that people like Pence didn’t do enough to help him — writing from a place where there will seemingly never be resolution or regret. In his wake, other Republican politicians and supporters have advanced the idea that the people inside the Capitol might not have been pro-Trump, or that the event everyone watched on TV might not have been that bad; others have opted to just move on. “I don't think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,” Kevin McCarthy said outside the White House on Wednesday, as Trump continues questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. “I think that is all over with.” Advertisement  Meanwhile, one of the Republicans I spoke with remains shaken by something that happened on Jan. 6, unrelated to the pipe bombs or bombing suspect. As you may have seen, police arrested an Alabama man with 11 Molotov cocktails, lots of ammo, and handwritten notes about specific public officials. Police claim that when the man returned to his parked truck that evening, he told them that the mason jars in his truck contained a specific mixture of chemicals that works like napalm. For the Republican, just the idea of a weapon like that, used against anyone...“The stuff blows up, it would stick to their skin, like burn their skin off. OK, like, wow. That’s something,” he said, with emotion. “For people you don’t even know, that’s something.”As bad as Jan. 6 was, and nothing can really compare to multiple deaths and the visual of the smoky Capitol, the prevailing takeaway when you think hard about the day and closely examine the videos and details is how much worse it could have been: What if police hadn't evacuated lawmakers? But it’s true even in accidental ways. What if someone had kicked one of the bombs? What if nobody had found them, and a bomb exploded on Jan. 8 during the national security panic we were already having? Imagine if someone had rear-ended the truck with this homemade napalm inside.One detail that got a little lost in the overlapping chaos and compressed timelines: The police found the Molotov cocktails when they evacuated all the buildings around the RNC; he had parked on a side street nearby. ●

One year after former president Donald Trump's supporters tried to overturn an election, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a dire warning at the scene of the attack: The threat to democracy and the potential for political violence continues, driven by new, Republican-led voter restrictions across the country.“Those who stormed this Capitol, and those who instigated and incited, and those who called on them to do so, held a dagger at the throat of America and American democracy,” Biden said. “They didn’t come here out of patriotism or principle.

Advertisement     He asked: ""Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?""Both Biden and Harris emphasized how, in the aftermath of the attempted insurrection, the fragility of American democracy and the need to actively defend it has been clear, evoking hard-won battles for the vote by Black civil rights leaders.""If we do not defend it,” Harris said, “Democracy simply will not stand.""One year on, there are hundreds of criminal cases stemming from the riot winding their way through the court system. Far-right extremism continues to adapt and worm its way into the mainstream. And Republicans continue to push conspiracy theories around the election and stall voting rights reforms in the Senate. Advertisement     “New laws are being written not to protect the vote but to deny it,” Biden said. ""Not only to suppress the vote but to subvert it. Not to strengthen and protect our democracy. Because the former president lost, instead of looking at election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections. It’s wrong. It’s undemocratic.”He continued: “Let's speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results.""Biden and Harris made the case that the Jan. 6 attack was not only a physical threat to democracy but that the election denial ideology behind the attack also spurred a series of voter restriction bills from Republican legislators across the country.In the past year, 19 states have passed laws that restrict voter access, on the same basis that drove hundreds, including groups of white supremacists, to storm the Capitol grounds, assault and demean police officers, and hunt for elected officials while a gallows hung on the Capitol lawn: the false narrative, pushed by Trump, that Biden stole the election.Biden called Trump out in his address on Thursday morning, pointing to his actions spurring on the attackers on Jan. 6 and his continued attempts to spread misinformation and inflame election denial conspiracy theories. Advertisement     “For the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election. He tried to prevent a peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob reached the Capitol. But they failed. They failed,” Biden said.“His bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution,” he said. ""He cannot accept that he lost.""Harris compared the need to defend democracy from extremists today to the blood spilled in the battle for civil rights in decades past.“What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building,” she said. “What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.”“On Jan. 6, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful,” Harris said.“The 'big lie' didn't just drive the insurrection,” said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice. ""It has driven a wave of anti-voter laws across the country, laws to restrict voting and pull cut back on voting rights and laws to change who does the counting — sabotage on top of voter suppression.""Waldman said Biden has been “more muted than would have been ideal” about voting rights and the threats to democracy over the past year, but that he sees the president being more proactive now: between his remarks this week and plans to travel to Georgia next week specifically to talk about voting rights reform.Voting rights advocates said it was important to hear Biden clearly and specifically condemn anti-democratic forces. But they ultimately have their eyes on key voting rights legislation. Advertisement     Protecting American democracy, voting rights advocates said, means going beyond holding those responsible for Jan. 6 responsible for their actions — the real goal is passing those voter protection measures, which a majority of Republicans in the Senate oppose. Biden directly pointing to voting reform bills as a means to stem the tide of anti-voter access bills underwritten by election denial ideology was a welcome sign to voting rights advocates.“Republicans will say, Oh, he's politicizing this solemn day of remembrance or whatever,” Waldman said. “Every major speech by presidents that are effective at a moment like this have a political purpose,” he added, referring to the Gettysburg Address and Bill Clinton’s speech after the Oklahoma City bombing, a right-wing terrorist attack.On the eve of the anniversary, Rev. Leah Daughtry, campaign manager with Fighting for Our Vote, said that she wanted to see Biden make a clear connection between the events of Jan. 6 and the need for voting rights protection to counter the ongoing threats to elections and democracy in the US.“I want to see Joe Biden remind us of who we are, of what our principles are, what our higher calling is, and then I want to see him tie that to the existential threat that we have right now,” Daughtry said. “That we shouldn't take for granted that what happened on Jan. 6 can never happen again. That he is fully committed with everything that he and the administration has to ensure that our voting rights are protected.”Two bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would represent the most significant defenses to voters' rights since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. The first bill would set national standards for elections, outlaw gerrymandering, enshrine the right to vote by mail, and standardize voter ID laws. The second would reestablish antidiscrimination protections stripped away from the Voting Rights Act by two Supreme Court decisions in recent years, which has left voters of color, in particular, vulnerable to having their access to voting cut off by state and local officials. Advertisement     “In response to Jan. 6, it would stop the voter suppression wave,” Waldman said.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged the Senate to pass voting rights reforms in response to Jan. 6 in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Monday.“January 6th was a symptom of a broader illness — an effort to delegitimize our election process and the Senate must advance systemic democracy reforms to repair our republic or else the events of that day will not be an aberration — they will be the new norm,” Schumer wrote.Senate Democrats support both bills — but that’s not enough to get past Republicans, in an evenly divided Senate where it takes 60 votes to pass any legislation because of the filibuster. The current challenge for Biden and Senate Democrats is to convince Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to support changes to Senate procedure that would provide an exception to filibuster rules, preventing Republicans from shooting down voting rights legislation.“I mean, it's just been a series of unfortunate events and fumbles,” New Georgia Project CEO Nsé Ufot said about how the Biden administration has handled the voting reform bills. Advertisement     While voting rights advocates acknowledge that Biden may not have more forcefully called out Republicans for stalling voting reform — the way activists have — because he may need them on his side to pass other aspects of his agenda, Ufot said she’s disappointed he hasn’t used his years of experience and relationships in the Senate to push harder for voting rights bills.“I did not serve four decades in the United States Senate. I can't whip votes. I can't get my former colleagues to get rid of the filibuster. They can,” she said. “So there are things that I can and should be doing, as an organizer, as an activist, as a citizen. And there are things that only the president of the United States can do.”Daughtry, by contrast, said she thought Biden has been forceful already in pushing for the bills. ""I want to see him continue to double down with his colleagues, his former colleagues in the Senate, to put the full resources of the administration to work in ensuring that we can pass voting rights legislation,"" she said.“The buck stops with the United States Senate, and they've got to do their jobs to preserve democracy,” Daughtry said. “It is not the president's job alone.”

Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported. Advertisement     Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims.""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover. Advertisement     The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him. Advertisement     “The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture.It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

Far-right domestic extremists like those who attacked the US Capitol a year ago have faced criminal charges from law enforcement and crackdowns from social media companies. But they have not gone away.On the contrary, they have evolved and adopted new strategies while regrouping, recruiting, and muscling their way into the mainstream with worrying success, experts say. And their ranks are growing. Advertisement     “Many of us thought these groups would splinter and fall apart and go underground after the FBI started going after them. But that hasn’t really been the case,” Heidi Beirich, cofounder and chief strategy officer of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a nonprofit focused on transnational hate and far-right movements, told BuzzFeed News.Indeed, as the country marks the anniversary of one of the darkest days in American history and prepares for the consequential midterm elections in the fall — where extremists, such as MAGA supporters, could again try to undermine the will of voters — extremism researchers and government officials are warning that homegrown extremists pose a greater threat to our democracy than they did before Jan. 6, 2021. They just look a bit different now.“The threat of domestic extremism today is perhaps less obvious. We’re not seeing the Proud Boys organize massive marches in Washington, DC, or militias storming capitol buildings every weekend. But what’s happening is gravely serious,” Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told BuzzFeed News.In a new report published Tuesday, Holt wrote that domestic extremists were “battered by the blowback [they] faced after the Capitol riot, but not broken by it. In fact, the sentiments espoused by domestic extremist causes are as public and insidious as ever.”  Advertisement     Far-right extremists, he told BuzzFeed News, are increasingly seeking legitimacy by latching onto mainstream conservative causes; they are taking a decentralized approach, preferring to operate in small groups or cells; and they are switching their focus from national actions to hyperlocal initiatives, like focusing on school board and city council meetings.There have been several reports in recent months about far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists, including members of the neo-fascist street gang the Proud Boys, showing up and intimidating officials making decisions on health measures and school initiatives at community meetings.Holt’s report highlights how extremists’ ideas are increasingly finding fertile ground among disaffected conservatives and leading voices in the Republican Party who are teaming with them to fight “culture wars” on topics like vaccines, race, and education.Beirich said that shift is a serious cause for alarm.“When I look back at the last year, the thing that I find most astounding isn’t really about the groups we’d label extremist — it’s about what’s happened with the Republican party… The infiltration of extremists into its ranks,” she said.
 


She cited extremist and white supremacist ideas such as the “great replacement theory” — the false idea that white people are being purposely replaced by nonwhite immigrants — being peddled by GOP politicians and Fox News commentators as evidence of the radicalization of the conservative right and “extremism going mainstream.” Advertisement     “I’m hard-pressed to even call them fringe ideas anymore,” she said. “They’re not confined to extremists. You can’t call it a fringe idea; it’s a mainstream idea among conservatives.”The experts’ concerns were backed Tuesday by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who said that authorities over the past year “have improved and strengthened our approach to combating this dynamic, evolving threat.”In the wake of the pro-Trump mob attack on the Capitol, President Joe Biden made combating domestic violent extremism one of his top priorities and enlisted leaders across government agencies to help. Department of Justice and FBI officials, in particular, have led the charge. They have testified in front of Congress on several occasions about the threat posed by extremists, particularly those on the far-right side of the political spectrum. With Jan. 6, they are at the forefront of not only the festering extremist problem but also one of the largest criminal investigations in US history.More than 700 people, including several with military experience and many associated with white supremacist and anti-government extremist groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters, have been charged in the sweeping federal probe into the Capitol attack that was blamed for the deaths of five people and dozens more injuries. The images of the rioters stomping on Capitol police officers, crashing through barricades, bashing in windows with poles adorned with the American Flag, and storming the halls of Congress are seared into the American consciousness.While the Biden administration has made some strides in the fight against domestic violent extremists, Mayorkas said the threat of them remains “very grave.”Some experts think the US government was slow to respond and will have trouble tackling the problem of extremism.Beirich said authorities should have taken steps a decade ago to quash the rise of far-right extremism and white nationalism, “when this stuff really was on the fringe [and] it could have had a massive impact.” Advertisement     Now, with it so deeply entrenched in the mainstream political right and white supremacist and anti-government groups backing them up with threats of violence, she fears it may be too late to turn the tide.“If 2024 is contested like 2020 was,” she added, referring to the upcoming midterm elections, “we’re going to have major civil unrest in this country.”

Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up. Advertisement     Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree?JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago. Advertisement     SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character. Advertisement     
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what???? Advertisement     SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

369,“Are we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?” President Joe Biden asked during a speech at the US Capitol.,"


Australian authorities canceled the visa of the world's No. 1 tennis player, Novak Djokovic, on Thursday after he failed to provide appropriate proof regarding his exemption from rules requiring foreigners to be vaccinated, officials said.The decision was made after the Serbian player was questioned overnight at a Melbourne airport by federal officials amid widespread anger Down Under that he was granted a medical exemption from COVID vaccination to play at the Australian Open. Advertisement     “The visa for Novak Djokovic has been canceled,” Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said on the Australian breakfast news show Sunrise. “Obviously that follows a review of the exemption that was provided through the Victorian government process. They were looking at the integrity and the evidence behind it.”“It’s a matter for him whether he wishes to appeal that, but if a visa is canceled somebody will have to leave the country,” he added.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision was made out of the desire to continue to be vigilant in the pandemic.
 


A source told BuzzFeed News that Djokovic and his coaching team were still at the airport and planned to file a legal appeal, but they did not expect to be successful.“They expect to be on the flight back home later in the day,” the source said.The top-ranked singles tennis player, who is seeking a record 21st Grand Slam title, was quizzed by border officials for several hours after he landed late Wednesday Australian time.According to Reuters, his father told Serbian media that the player was made to wait alone in a room at the airport under ​​armed guard pending a final decision.“Not the most usual trip Down Under,” Djokovic coach Goran Ivanisevic posted on Instagram from the airport at around 5 a.m.
 


Djokovic’s beliefs and behavior have made headlines throughout the pandemic. In April 2020, he said he was opposed to vaccines and that he wouldn’t want to be required to receive a shot in order to travel. Just months later, he and his wife tested positive for COVID after he organized and played in exhibition matches that flouted social distancing recommendations. In October 2021, he said that questions about his vaccination status were “inappropriate.” Advertisement     The tournament’s defending champion had surprised many Tuesday when he posted on social media that he had been granted an “exemption permission” to travel to Australia. But, as Melbourne’s Age newspaper first reported, it was not clear whether Djokovic had brought sufficient evidence to prove his exemption reason.Under Australian law, foreigners traveling into the country must have a visa and be fully vaccinated. Tennis Australia and officials in Victoria, where Melbourne is located, made similar requirements for players who wanted to participate in the Open without first undertaking a mandatory 14-day quarantine.But Australian immunization officials had outlined some temporary vaccine exemptions for its citizens, which include people who have had a PCR-confirmed case of COVID in the last six months. It is not clear if these apply to foreigners seeking to enter Australia, but tennis officials had pointed to these exemptions in their decision to allow Djokovic to participate.That Djokovic was granted an exemption to play in Melbourne, which endured one of the longest lockdowns in the world as Australia sought to keep COVID cases at zero prior to widespread vaccination, caused a massive outcry in the country.Tennis and Victorian officials stressed his application had gone through a “double blind” review process, but large sections of the Australian public and media railed against the decision. Advertisement     “I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in,” former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis wrote on Twitter.Asked about the tennis player’s exemption at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Djokovic would need to ""provide acceptable proof"" for his claim that he couldn’t be vaccinated for medical reasons.""We await his presentation and what evidence he provides us to support that,"" Morrison said. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else, and he'll be on the next plane home.""On Wednesday, Morrison’s government indicated that they would have a say on whether Djokovic would be allowed into the country.“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said in a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone.”“No individual competing at the Australian Open will be afforded any special treatment,” Andrews said.Hunt, the health minister, said the rules were tough but fair. ""Australians have had to do it tough,"" Hunt said, ""and Australians in many different states and territories have had to show their vaccination records in some cases to enter premises and cafés and other things, and it's not unreasonable to have exactly the same requirement for all who enter this country.""

370,Hundreds of Facebook moderators at the company’s Mountain View campus can now work from home after their employer Accenture reversed an unpopular return-to-work mandate.,"


Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly. Advertisement     
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning. Advertisement     The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered.Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites? Advertisement     Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account. Advertisement     
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life. Advertisement     Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost.Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible. Advertisement     
 


“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

371,"The government released new photos of Wu-Tang Clan’s legendary Once Upon A Time In Shaolin, but says the price it got is a “trade secret.”","


The US government claims that the price it got for the legendary sole copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is a “trade secret” that cannot be revealed, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News.The album was originally purchased for about $2 million by pharmaceutical executive and hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in 2015. When he was convicted of securities fraud in 2018 and ordered to forfeit $7.36 million, US marshals seized the album along with other assets. Advertisement     Last July, the Justice Department announced it had found a buyer for the album but didn’t identify the individual or the price. Attorney Peter Scoolidge told the New York Times that digital art collective PleasrDAO purchased the album from the US government for $4 million. The documents say that the new buyers assume the same terms of Shkreli’s purchase agreement. They may display the presentation box embedded with the Wu-Tang Clan logo, which was designed by British Moroccan artist Yahya Rouach, but they are prohibited from making copies of the album.
 


According to a copy of the five-page purchase agreement, the album was ""sealed with “tamper-proof evidence tape” and delivered to the new owners “in that state.”The new documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, include dozens of previously undisclosed photographs of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The album, conceived by the rap group as a work of art, is held in a nickel silver box stored in a cedarwood box and covered in black cow leather with light beige velvet lining. It also includes a 175-page leather-bound lyric book and a gold-leafed certificate of authenticity. The government redacted images of the two CDs, the song titles and the lyric book citing ""trade secrets.""Wu-Tang Clan said the choice to produce only one copy of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin was a form of protest of the way music had been devalued in the digital era.Neither Scoolidge nor representatives for Wu-Tang Clan responded to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. On March 9 2018, after Shkreli was ordered to forfeit the album, Scoolidge sent a letter to the federal prosecutor on the case that said “any transfer of ‘Once Upon a Time in Shaolin’ by Mr. Shkreli to any third party is restricted substantially by the terms of the September 3, 2015 Purchase Agreement through which Mr. Shrkeli obtained the work.”At the time, Scoolidge represented Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh, a co-producer of the album who owned a 50 percent share of the master recordings. The letter said Azzourgarh was prepared to litigate to stop the forfeiture of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin because the transfer of the album to the US government violated the terms of the contract Shkreli entered into when he bought it. Azzourgarh's name was redacted from the letter but a source familiar with it confirmed it was him. Advertisement     “The United States and its agencies cannot take greater property rights from Mr. Shkreli than were granted by my client in the Purchase Agreement,” said the letter released by the Justice Department Wednesday. Azzourgarh ""is prepared to file a petition under the forfeiture order to protect his rights in the work. Please advise if you are open to potentially working out an agreement with my client and Mr. Shkreli that protects my client’s rights so that we can avoid the need to burden"" the federal judge that ordered the forfeiture.It appears Scoolidge and federal prosecutors were working on an agreement for more than a year. On Dec. 20, 2019, the associate general counsel in the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York sent Scoolidge a letter indicating the government was gearing up to sell Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and needed guidance on how to do that without violating the terms of Shkreli's original purchase agreement.RZA, the de facto leader of the rap group, told a New York radio station last year he regretted selling the album to Shkreli. But since the government’s sale to PleasrDAO, RZA said he believes the album is in better hands.

Twelve people — eight of whom were children — died Wednesday morning after a massive fire ripped through a Philadelphia apartment building, officials said.The duplex was owned by the federally funded Philadelphia Housing Authority, whose properties are home to about 80,000 low-income residents.At a news conference, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called it ""without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history.""""Losing so many kids is just devastating,"" he added. ""Keep these babies in your prayers.""There were 26 people living in the building, and the death toll was feared to rise due to the ongoing nature of recovery efforts, First Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said. At least eight people escaped on their own, and two — one adult, and one child — were transported to the hospital. Advertisement     City officials said in a statement Wednesday night that one child who was rescued from the building later died.""It was terrible — I’ve been around for 35 years now, and this is probably one of the worst fires I’ve ever been to,"" Murphy said. ""We plan on making sure that this tremendous loss of life did not happen in vain.""Officials earlier on Wednesday, as recovery efforts at the scene were ongoing, had given a death toll of 13. They revised that number to 12 fatalities Wednesday night.There were at least four smoke detectors in the building, but they didn't go off during the fire, Murphy said. According to the Philadelphia Housing Authority, he added, four smoke detectors had been installed in 2019, and two more were installed in 2020.The agency's CEO, Kelvin A. Jeremiah, said in a statement that the building's two units ""were last inspected in April 2021 and May 2021 respectively,"" and that ""all smoke detectors were operating properly at that time.""“This unimaginable loss of life has shaken all of us at PHA,"" Jeremiah said. ""It is too early for us to say more.""The cause of the fire is under investigation, though it is ""not necessarily considered suspicious,"" Murphy said. Though he could not say whether the building was overcapacity, he said 26 residents is ""a tremendous amount of people to be living in a duplex.""Dinesh Indala, Philadelphia Housing Authority's Vice President of Operations, told CBS Philly they had not been aware how many residents were living there, saying the ""count for the number of people on that property is too high"" but adding that it could be due to ""people coming and visiting"" for the holidays. Advertisement     The mayor, meanwhile, urged the public not to ""make judgment on the number of people living in the house.""""Sometimes it’s better for people to be indoors than on the street,"" Kenney said. ""Maybe they were relatives or people that needed to be sheltered.""The names of those who died were not immediately released, but heartbroken neighbors said they remembered seeing some of the youngest victims playing outside over the years.“I knew some of those kids — I used to see them playing on the corner,” 34-year-old neighbor Dannie McGuire told the Associated Press. “And some of those kids have lived here as long as us.”

373,Let's talk about Netflix's Don't Look Up.,"


Hundreds of Facebook contractors who were ordered to return to the company’s Mountain View campus this month amid an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases were told today that they can continue working from home, an abrupt reversal of a company mandate.Following a BuzzFeed News inquiry, Accenture, a subcontractor that manages content moderation for Facebook, walked back its late December demand that moderators return to work in Mountain View on Jan. 24. The policy change was set against a backdrop of worker dissent as contractors openly questioned why they had to report to the office when full-time Facebook employees could defer their return by several months. Multiple moderators threatened to resign if health exemptions continued to be denied for vulnerable contractors. Advertisement     Contractors were told verbally on Wednesday morning that the return to work was being delayed.In response to a detailed list of questions, a spokesperson said that given current health data “we have let our team members working from home know they should continue to do so.”""We work collaboratively with our people on individual accommodations, including work from home, in compliance with all applicable employment laws and local regulations,"" the spokesperson added.
 


In a late December staff call, Accenture told a team of hundreds embedded at one of the social network’s California headquarters that they must return to the office on Jan. 24. Employees who subsequently requested special consideration for being immunocompromised or protecting vulnerable family members were not given exemptions. “Once the return to office is complete for Meta, there unfortunately will not be work that can be done from home on this project,” those who inquired were told in a boilerplate email. The announcement came just weeks after Facebook’s parent company, Meta, told full-time employees that they could defer their return to work for three to five months amid a flurry of similar actions by companies like Google and Apple.Accenture’s return-to-office mandate would have affected a building of roughly 400 people tasked with reviewing and flagging for removal the worst of what’s posted to Facebook. Some said the decision underscored the lesser treatment of Facebook contractors.“It’s unconscionable and I’m just sick of it,” one contractor told BuzzFeed News, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are forbidden from speaking publicly about Facebook or Accenture matters.
 


In response to a series of detailed questions, a Meta spokesperson said the company will “continue to prioritize everyone's health and safety” as it works to get teams back into the office.Contractors claim quarters are too cramped to properly social distance. (Previously, moderators worked out of two buildings leased by Facebook, but as of last year were consolidated into a single facility.) One contractor told BuzzFeed News that Accenture’s COVID protocols require them to remain 3 feet apart at all times. “But that’s a lie because each desk is 1 foot apart,” they said. Workers are also concerned about using elevators, which are limited to four people at staggered intervals but are workers’ only mode of traveling between floors, as stairwells have been completely closed off. One contractor said the elevator limits are not really being enforced. Facebook and Accenture both declined to comment on these matters.Internal emails viewed by BuzzFeed News show that several Facebook contractors tested positive for COVID in December. As of Monday, the number of cases was reportedly as high as 34 people. Contractors said they only learned about the total number of cases by talking to their coworkers, as communications regarding infections are limited to affected floors. Facebook and Accenture declined to comment on the number of COVID cases among contract workers.Contractors told BuzzFeed News that COVID sick leave, which entailed two weeks of regular pay for employees who tested positive for the virus, stopped being offered in September. Facebook contractors in Mountain View also do not receive hazard pay, and in October 2020, hundreds of Facebook workers signed a petition demanding paid leave for moderators at the company’s Austin offices, Motherboard reported. Advertisement     Contractors who test positive for COVID or suspect they might have COVID ""are paired with a case worker to ensure that they have access to a comprehensive range of benefits and support, including paid time off, while they are recovering,"" an Accenture spokesperson said.But sources within the company told BuzzFeed News that connecting with COVID support services has been difficult at times, and that they do not wish to use PTO in lieu of designated sick leave. Contractors said an online portal for submitting accommodation requests is also not functional, and called Accenture's larger support system a ""broken cycle."" Accenture has not replied to a request for comment on these claims.""There's no submit or continue button after putting in all the information,"" one worker said. ""Prior to putting any information in, though, it does mention talk to your supervisor. But the supervisor will tell you to email HR. But HR will send that link.""
 


On internal company message boards viewed by BuzzFeed News, Facebook employees and contractors criticized Accenture’s handling of COVID infections in its offices and lack of sick leave for moderators. Workers expressed confusion over how to alert the company should they test positive for COVID and objected to being told to use personal vacation hours to recover. Advertisement     The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day. In California, the state’s Department of Health reported more than 230,000 new COVID cases on Tuesday.Prior to Accenture’s policy change, nearly a dozen contractors publicly and privately expressed their intent to resign rather than return to work. Contractors told BuzzFeed News that Accenture and Facebook were unresponsive to their requests for personal exemptions.“Regular Facebook employees can go back at their leisure,” one contractor said. “Contractors, as always, know they’re treated as second-class citizens.”

Tomi Obaro: On Christmas Eve, Netflix dropped Don’t Look Up, a star-studded satire about two scientists played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio who discover a comet hurtling toward a very indifferent Earth. Written and directed by Adam McKay (The Big Short), the film was one of Netflix’s most-watched movies ever. But reception has been mixed. Let’s discuss!First things first, who actually liked this movie?Jason Wells: Me.Scaachi Koul: I liked it, but I also had the benefit of zero expectation.Stephanie McNeal: I also liked it!Elamin Abdelmahmoud: I can’t relate to the “mixed” reception, because I had a good time. But because of how we talk on the internet, sometimes simply saying you liked something comes across as suggesting that this is, like, the top Oscar contender for the year. Don’t Look Up is… fine. It’s fine. I had a good time. Advertisement     OK, I guess I am alone in finding the film extremely unsubtle and an absolute slog to get through. For the folks who like the movie, why?JW: I did not come into this expecting whatever I think others were — give yourself over to the camp and enjoy the spectacle. Netflix clearly spent a shit ton on this thing and it showed, bad bangs and all.SK: I’m a big advocate for movies that press on the pleasure centers of our brains, even if those movies aren’t actually any “good.” Didn’t Don’t Look Up do its job? A weird Ariana Grande song, Jennifer Lawrence in a haircut that is a direct affront to God, forcing Leonardo DiCaprio to pretend he’s married to a woman his own age, Jonah Hill with a Birkin. Come on. Don’t be greedy. You can’t ask for more.SM: I thought it made the point it wanted to make and did so well. I also was fully entertained for the entire thing, which was super long. I just felt like it was a satire that worked for me, even though it made me kind of depressed because I think it hit too close to home.EA: Some folks don’t like to be lectured in their movies and television. Others are fans of Aaron Sorkin. I am the latter. I love a pedantic movie. This is Adam McKay’s third pedantic movie — The Big Short is basically a sentient angry Reddit post, and Vice is a sarcastic Wikipedia page, and god I love it. I love it! Sometimes, I want to watch things that not only confirm my worldview, but also actively kick other worldviews right in the gonads. But to give you perspective on the kind of person I am: I watched the entirety of Sorkin’s The Newsroom. Twice. I am sorry to say that I am the primary audience for Don’t Look Up. Advertisement     Some critics have expressed negative opinions about the film. In Manohla Dargis’s New York Times review, she notes that “McKay’s touch here is considerably blunter and less productive than it has been in a while” and even suggests that Meryl Streep’s character is kind of sexist. Alison Willmore (former BuzzFeeder!) writes in her Vulture review, “McKay’s movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue. He seems to believe that people need laughs and famous faces to be lured into thinking about more pressing matters, and he hates them for it.” Do you agree?JW: If you think it’s too on the nose, look in the mirror.SK: Isn’t that the point? I appreciated the raw nihilism of it; it’s not like the ending gives anyone much hope for the future, nor should it.EA: This movie would never work if the allegory was more subtle. What do you want, slowly rising sea levels and melting glaciers? To turn up the satirical absurdity, it needed to be directly on the nose. I mean, “Me and your father are for the jobs the comet will provide” — come on, that hits! You have a planet that’s warming at an alarming rate, and politicians asking how to create jobs fighting climate change?? The time for subtlety was, oh, maybe 20 years ago. Advertisement     SM: This seems overly nitpicking to me TBH.One incontestable fact is that the film is jam-packed with stars. Which cameo was your favorite?JW: It felt like everyone was a cameo in this, and I know Cate is getting a lot of ish, but when the comet is hitting and she said, “Honestly, I think I’d just rather drink and talk shit about people,” I saw myself.SK: Probably the little blip we got of Chris Evans, one of the top three Chrises for sure. I don’t think I even realized it was him until much, much later. I’m curious how you pay someone for a cameo that lasts, what, 20 seconds?EA: Gotta hand it to Kid Cudi! More Cudi in movies, please.SM: I think one of the reasons the movie worked is every person was very talented. I loved Jonah Hill and Meryl the most, probably.Which actor had the most impressive performance?JW: Every character was unlikeable, so kudos to them. But Meryl Streep took the cake. Thumbs up to her stylist.EA: Jonah Hill as the president’s son and chief of staff — extremely punchable behavior. I am never motivated to violence, so shouts to Jonah Hill for making me really hate his character. Advertisement     
 


For all the film’s star power, the wigs are horrendous. (Rob Morgan’s is a hate crime, as I have previously tweeted; Tyler Perry’s influence is undefeated!) Who had the worst wig?JW: Rob Morgan vs. Jennifer’s bangs.EA: I do not notice wigs, and even I shrieked at the Rob Morgan situation.SK: Pretty bummed about Meryl’s hair-in-a-can wig. Couldn’t someone have run a comb through it at least?SM: The Bezos/Musk tech guy character’s because he was so creepy.What was the most surprising thing about the film?JW: The total destruction of Earth??!! It was beautiful to behold.EA: I think beautiful is exactly the word here. That whole last sequence was so emotional and moving. Did I cry? Give me a raise and I’ll tell you.SK: Meryl’s lower back tat. Also, that she decided to do this movie in the first place. Good for her.JW: OMG yes. The lower back tat wins.SM: I personally didn’t see the “tech genius harvests the comet for money” thing coming, and it made me want to die.JW: Same. Although I didn’t see a lot of things coming in the movie, so by the time that happened I was just like, “OK.”Do we want more movies like this in 2022? Is the movie lecture having a moment?JW: It is, and I’m here for it.SK: I don’t know that it was really a lecture; to me, it felt more like a cry for help. A lecture suggests it would be more pointed, but instead it was just a reminder that everything is bad, all the time, on every planet, for the rest of time. But I’m not against more movies that just lean into despair — what are we doing, performing optimism? And for what???? Advertisement     SM: Yes, because it was actually CREATIVE. It wasn’t a biopic or a remake or something. At least we can all say it wasn’t something that we had seen before.EA: For some of us, the movie lecture never went away. ●

Every year, police officers claim to have suffered near-fatal overdoses after accidentally touching fentanyl, a synthetic opioid more powerful than morphine or heroin.“Deputy Nearly Dies of Fentanyl Overdose,” read a headline from the Sacramento Bee this summer. “Officer Exposed to Fentanyl & Transported to Local Hospital,” stated a press release from the Santa Rosa Police Department in 2020. “Police Officer Overdoses After Brushing Fentanyl Powder Off His Uniform,” read the headline on a CNN story from 2017. Advertisement     But there’s something off about this seeming epidemic of accidental overdoses: It is virtually impossible to overdose simply by touching or getting too close to fentanyl. Doctors and toxicologists warn that the hype around this perceived threat is harming overdose victims, taxpayers, and first responders.Accidental overdose by skin exposure “is chemically and physically implausible,” said Dr. Ryan Marino, a medical toxicologist and addiction medicine specialist who serves as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.Dr. Andrew Stolbach, an emergency physician and medical toxicologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said, “It's not possible to overdose on fentanyl by touching it. If it was absorbed well through the skin, people wouldn’t inject it and snort it in order to get high.”Despite this, people who use the drug are facing serious legal repercussions — such as charges of assault or endangerment of officers — for supposedly causing these impossible overdoses.“People should not be in jail for imaginary crimes,” Marino said.
 


“Bad timing. Bad luck.”That’s how Justin Buckel describes what happened the night of May 12, 2017. He had just been released from jail on bond in East Liverpool, Ohio, when he was pulled over. The officer was quickly joined by Chris Green, a local police officer who was off duty but happened to be nearby.The officers searched Buckel’s car for drugs and found powder that later tested positive for fentanyl. Buckel said at the scene that the powder in the vehicle might include fentanyl. He was arrested. At least an hour later, Green complained to a colleague he didn’t feel well. He had brushed some powder off of his shirt, touching it with his bare skin. The colleague later recounted in police documents that Green “became saturated in sweat and was barely coherent.” Green told BuzzFeed News he remembers “panicking, trying to talk,” and falling forward, but nothing after that. He was taken to a hospital and treated for an overdose.Buckel pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking and possession and was sent to prison for six and a half years. In addition, he was charged with assault on a peace officer for “exposing” Green to fentanyl, which made up a year and a half of the jail time.When he was sentenced, the Ohio attorney general’s office put out a press release that led with the assault charge. Mike DeWine, who was attorney general at the time and is now governor, contributed a quote: ""Fentanyl is so dangerous that even the slightest exposure can be deadly, but thankfully in this case naloxone was close at hand.” (DeWine’s office told BuzzFeed News in a statement that Green’s overdose was a “documented, medical incident” and claimed it is “factually incorrect” that this overdose was medically implausible.) The news media picked the story up accordingly. Advertisement     
 


Buckel’s arrest was one of many similar stories that got national attention. The prevalence of these tales of accidental overdose has increased along with the amount of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply in the United States.A study published in the Harm Reduction Journal last year showed that stories of accidental fentanyl exposure made up over 150 media reports in 2017. Stolbach, the Johns Hopkins physician, was one of the authors of a 2020 Journal of Medical Toxicology study that traced the origin of the concern to a small number of reports from 2013, noting that such media reports increased in 2016, the same year the United States Drug Enforcement Agency itself issued a warning that “fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin or through accidental inhalation of airborne powder.”A DEA spokesperson confirmed the agency later took down an accompanying video warning of this supposed risk that was posted on YouTube and noted that the DEA follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for preventing occupational exposure to illicit drugs. More recent first responder guidance from the DEA says, “Incidental skin contact may occur during daily activities but is not expected to lead to harmful effects if the contaminated skin is promptly washed off with water.” Representatives for the agency did not respond to a request for comment on the 2016 warning. Advertisement     The Journal of Medical Toxicology study noted two distinct spikes in media reports about first responder opioid exposures in 2017. The bigger spike came in the second quarter of the year, the same time period Buckel was arrested.Green appeared on CBS News five days after Buckel’s arrest, when anchor Norah O’Donnell told viewers, “The opioid crisis is not only dangerous for those addicted to the drugs, but also for first responders.” An on-air graphic declared, “OVERDOSE BY ACCIDENT.” Representatives for CBS News did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether medical experts were contacted for the story.A few months later, CBS’s fictional cop show Blue Bloods featured a harrowing plotline in which an officer was rushed to the hospital after touching a tray containing fentanyl. A suspect and doctor both proclaimed the officer had overdosed. Representatives for CBS did not respond in time for publication when asked whether toxicologists or other medical professionals were consulted about the episode. Over 8 million people watched it the night it premiered.Logically, the argument that passive fentanyl exposure poses an overdose risk to first responders falls apart with a little questioning. If it did, why don’t nurses who work with fentanyl in hospital settings experience similar symptoms? What about dealers, the loved ones of drug users, or volunteers at needle exchange sites? Advertisement     Experts have long warned that this pervasive concern can create serious consequences for drug users, first responders, and taxpayers. Marino said he has seen first responders hesitating to resuscitate patients experiencing fentanyl overdoses both in the hospital and in the field. The 2020 Harm Reduction Journal study pointed out that officers report entering the field with significant fear of fentanyl. A study published the previous year in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness surveyed first responders in New York, finding that 80% of them believed “briefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.”
 


While many first responders clearly experience physical suffering after a believed exposure to fentanyl, experts suggest it’s possible they are experiencing panic attacks or “line-of-sight” afflictions, not overdoses, and are suffering negative consequences to their mental health. Some symptoms of opioid overdoses — such as perspiration and lightheadedness — are also associated with anxiety attacks.Ryan McNeil, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, said first responder descriptions of suspected overdoses sound like panic attacks, not toxicity, and ""it's galling that we're treating that as an overdose when it's not even how an overdose presents."" Advertisement     In August, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department came under fire for releasing a packaged PSA and insisting, even after an outcry from medical experts online, that it showed a deputy overdosing from passive fentanyl exposure.
 


The body camera footage is dramatic. Deputy David Faiivae falls to the ground after touching a powder, and one of his colleagues assures him, “I’m not going to let you die!” In the PSA, officers involved that day sit down for confessional-style interviews and Faiivae states, “I almost died.”What made this instance different from its predecessors was that doctors and experts organized to push back. Over 400 physicians, nurses, and public health researchers signed a letter demanding retractions from the major outlets that credulously repeated the department’s claim. They highlighted the 2017 findings of a joint American College of Medical Toxicology and American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, which found that “incidental dermal absorption is very unlikely to cause opioid toxicity,” and “toxicity cannot occur from simply being in proximity to the drug.”Under pressure, the department admitted the deputy never underwent a toxicology screening to determine if fentanyl was in his system, but they refused to disavow the video, even weeks later. A representative for the department confirmed to BuzzFeed News that Faiivae never underwent a toxicology screening and the organization has “not revisited this topic since that time.” They had no further comment. The story of the alleged overdose, dubious as it was, still spread. Green, who also says he is not sure he underwent a toxicology screening after his alleged overdose, posted an article about it to his own Facebook account. Advertisement     
 


Despite the very public myth-busting of fentanyl overdose from accidental contact with the drug, law enforcement officials across the country continue to go to great, very expensive lengths to avoid this “risk,” and people continue to face incarceration for supposedly causing these accidental overdoses.On Sept. 16, officials in Greene County, Tennessee, charged Tommy Starnes with two felony counts of reckless endangerment after a deputy and EMS worker both experienced “symptoms of an overdose” after treating him, according to a release from the Greene County Sheriff’s Department. Greene County Sheriff Wesley Holt would not share additional information with BuzzFeed News on what those symptoms entailed.Unlike Buckel, who was simultaneously hit with a variety of other trafficking-related charges, Starnes is not suspected of selling drugs. The first responders were called for an overdose. They were there to save Starnes’ life. Advertisement     Upon arriving at the scene after reports of the first responders’ symptoms, Holt donned a hazmat suit to retrieve evidence. The Tennessee Highway Patrol even flew in decontamination equipment by helicopter. Holt estimates the total cost of the response was around $3,800.Holt told BuzzFeed News it’s “a sad situation” that taxpayers foot those bills. When asked if he was aware of the research showing passive fentanyl exposure poses no significant risk to law enforcement officers (thus rendering the helicopter decontamination unnecessary), he said he was not. He dismissed the idea that the first responders experienced anxiety or a so-called nocebo effect — the opposite of a placebo effect, wherein a negative outcome arises from negative expectations — and declined to say whether the deputy or EMS worker who came in contact with Starnes were given toxicology screenings.Reporting by a local journalist later revealed that every officer in Greene County has been given a protective suit in the wake of Starnes’ arrest. Holt estimates that cost the department another $800. The reporting also said the ambulance used to transport Starnes was given “an intense cleaning” with chemicals flown in by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. Representatives for the TBI did not say what that might have cost.Todd Estep, a public defender who represents Starnes, said he had not been aware of the body of research indicating that the endangerment his client was charged with is medically implausible until he was contacted by BuzzFeed News. Starnes, who also faces felony charges of possession, remains in jail awaiting an arraignment this month.
 


Green, like Holt, rejects the idea that any first responder’s reaction to the presence of fentanyl is brought on by anxiety or a nocebo effect. “I’m a pretty hardened guy,” he said. “Nothing really rattles me.” He is no longer with the ELPD. A review of internal documents showed he was terminated after a number of violations uncovered by an investigation ordered by East Liverpool Mayor Gregory Bricker, including dishonesty and discourteous treatment of the public. Green told BuzzFeed News he believes he was let go because he raised concerns about corruption in the department and is mounting a legal challenge to ensure “the facts will come out.”He has since found employment working in drug detection for a private company and told BuzzFeed News it is essentially the same job he had with the ELPD, but he makes “a ton more money.” Green is thrilled with his new gig, saying, “My passion is drugs. Like if I was allowed, I would literally be a cop for free if I could just hunt drugs and drug dealers all day.”He also dismissed doctors’ insistence that passive exposure cannot cause an overdose, saying, “I don't really care what the naysayers say or feel or whatever. I know what I experienced, and it's godawful.”It’s impossible to say for sure what is really going on in these instances, though Green and Holt both remain adamant that passive exposure is an overdose threat and the police are not lying or experiencing panic attacks. First responders, Green said, are either “really good actors and we have an elaborate hoax going on or the shit is real.” Advertisement     Stolbach, who helped author the 2017 position statement from the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology task force, said that what happened in the San Diego Sheriff’s Department video showed “some sort of medical event, but not opioid-poisoning definitive.” He doesn’t know why the message that these types of overdoses are impossible isn’t taking hold in police departments, even years after the possibility of passive overdose was debunked.“Every police officer or police official that I personally come into contact with, they're on board with me and they understand, and yet, somehow, this message isn't penetrating the police,” he said, adding that between the medical and law enforcement communities, “there’s not a lot of interface.”Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who is a former senior policy adviser to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, believes resistance to accurate information about the possibility of exposure overdoses isn’t just an issue among first responders. His concern lies with prosecutors.“It may not be an entirely rational process for them,” said Humphreys. “They could just be glad to have another way to charge people. Generally, as prosecutors, the more things you can charge somebody with, the more power you have, so even if they knew that this was mostly hysteria and hokum, they might still welcome the power. I don't know if you can change that.”Fentanyl can be absorbed through the skin, but only under unique circumstances. Fentanyl patches are used therapeutically by medical professionals all the time, which may have contributed to the belief that instantaneous absorption and subsequent overdose are possible. Advertisement     
 


“The fentanyl patch is not just fentanyl, so that is definitely completely different from what's on the streets. The patch is fentanyl combined with an alcohol or glycol product so that it becomes a solution and so those compounds do absorb through the skin,” said Marino, who explained that the 75-microgram patch does not contain “a big dose” and “takes 13 hours to get to just the therapeutic dose.” Overdosing, he said, would require “many, many hours of holding this patch against the skin.”Green told BuzzFeed News he used hand sanitizer before brushing the powder off of himself that day in 2017 and believes that could have facilitated some kind of absorption. Asked why he had a reaction but Buckel — who handled the powder too, which led to his conviction for tampering with evidence – didn’t, he said it was probably because Buckel used drugs and had a tolerance.Green also pointed out that another suspect arrested with Buckel was transported to the hospital before he was, though at the time, he questioned whether the suspect was trying to get out of jail. Green and the police report from the time both noted the suspect said he had asthma. Per the police report, the suspect experienced “shortness of breath and dizziness,” both of which are common symptoms of asthma attacks and do not align with the CDC’s warning signs of overdose.Both Stolbach and Humphreys expressed concern that fear of fentanyl exposure is increasing anxiety for police officers, whose job involves myriad dangers as it is. Humphreys said he would be willing to stand in front of cops and personally demonstrate the safety of touching fentanyl with his bare hand. Demonstrations and outreach, he said, could be one way to make the point. Stolbach said he met with officials from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department in the wake of August’s viral PSA (which has since been removed by Vimeo) and found them “receptive” to his feedback.Fighting the misconceptions around fentanyl exposure is easier said than done, given the saturation of the narrative within the law enforcement community, as well as in the news and on TV. Buckel’s lawyer, Coleen Dailey, said she tried to fight against Buckel’s assault charge in 2017, “but for every article that said that passive exposure did not cause an overdose, there was one that said it did.”Buckel, who remains in jail, said all he cares about now is “getting out and getting established,” reconnecting with his kids, and getting back to work. He will remain incarcerated for two more years, but he has advice for Starnes and others charged with endangerment or assault of an officer for fentanyl possession: “Fight the case,” he said.

Leah Frances is a photographer behind a popular Instagram account, American Squares, and the author of a book with the same name. “I couldn’t believe that name wasn’t taken,” she told us from her home outside Easton, Pennsylvania. Frances got started on Tumblr in 2013, after seeing some photographs by Stephen Shore when she worked at the Wall Street Journal.“I was so blown away that I went out and bought a camera and flew out to LA and walked around taking pictures.”Her work focuses on the interiors of diners — the very American restaurants modeled after the café cars on trains and grew in popularity in the early half of the 20th century. “My photographs are mostly empty of people, yet pushed-back chairs or half-finished meals on tables show that life did occur here,” she said. “Pictured are scenes where things once happened, never happened, or might still happen. Yet I don’t want us to be buried in collective amnesia: Things were never ‘normal.’ For example, if a political figure, even if they’re wealthy, if they sit beside you at a diner and eat a $4.99 hamburger suddenly they’re authentic. They’re working class. But of course, we all know it’s more complicated than that.” Advertisement

The apocalypse movie, which follows the world's reaction to the news that a planet-ending comet is heading straight for Earth, has been the talk of social media since its release last month. The first focus was, of course, the ensemble cast, which is made up of A-list heavy hitters such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Jonah Hill, Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, and Ariana Grande. Then it was the seemingly real-life parallels as scientists tried in vain to convince the world that the meteor was real and would have devastating global effects — something which appeared to reflect global warming. But the conversation surrounding the movie recently took a turn for the unexpected when viewers decided to call a phone number that's advertised in the movie. At one point during the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Dr. Randall Mindy, appears in a commercial for tech company BASH in order to put people's minds at ease about the comet. The commercial then shows a phone number, promising ""peace of mind"" if viewers should call. So, of course, some people watching at home thought they'd investigate... Upon finding out that it directed the caller to a sex hotline, one viewer tweeted: ""Kudos to you Don't Look Up to having the BASH hotline for their asteroid stress prevention hotline being linked to a Hot Singles in Your Area phone number.""

Andy — like many — rang in the new year with ~perhaps~ one too many drinks. And while a boozy New Year’s Eve might not seem far from the ordinary, it just so happened that Andy’s night was broadcast live to the nation. In the unlikely event that you missed it, the beloved host was the center of attention this weekend following several comments he made live on CNN during New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the night’s festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila, which — toward the latter half of the four-and-a-half-hour broadcast — escalated into chaos (or TV gold, whichever you prefer). As the alcohol seemingly got to work, Andy burst into several on-air rants, taking aim at a number of public figures ranging from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to showbiz pals like Ryan Seacrest. However, the night arguably peaked when he turned his attention to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. Despite Anderson’s failed attempts to defuse the situation, Andy declared live on-air that de Blasio was the “crappiest” mayor in NYC history, and went on to tell CNN viewers that “the only thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is what a horrible mayor he has been.” Inevitably, clips of the live moment wound up going viral. And while the drunken rant was largely well received by those who tuned in, not everyone was so impressed with Andy’s good-humored outburst. In fact, the backlash prompted a number of reports which falsely claimed that Andy had been fired by the network, with one article even quoting “TV insiders” who alleged that staff from CNN were “embarrassed and angry.” Although, these reports were swiftly debunked by a representative for CNN who informed BuzzFeed News that they are firmly standing by their host and are excited to welcome him back for next year’s installment. And now that the dust has finally settled, Andy is setting the record straight on exactly what went down behind the scenes. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show on Tuesday, the Bravo star hit back at the false reports that staff at CNN were left “angry” by his NYE antics. After Howard asked if he had seen the reports, Andy slammed the “unnamed sources” responsible for “making up” the claims and proceeded to shed some light on the situation. “Listen, I will not be shamed for having fun on New Year’s Eve. That’s why I’m there. That’s why they bring me there,” he began. Offering a little more clarity, Andy highlighted that the viral clips that attracted the most backlash — namely, his de Blasio rant — were taken from the final portion of the broadcast. “It’s a four-and-a-half-hour show,” he said. “The booze started kicking in at around 11:30, so everyone is focusing on kind of the last 45 minutes or hour that we were on the air.” “I kicked into high gear with 45 minutes left, so we had done 15 interviews before that point, you know,” he added. Taking a stand against the criticism, Andy made it clear once again that he doesn't feel bad for ringing in the new year with a bit of laughter. “I won’t be shamed for it! I had a blast! Anderson had a blast! We left and we were like, ‘That was fun, what a fun New Year’s Eve,’” the host explained. “No apologies for my drinking on New Year’s Eve. None.” The TV star was subsequently asked to shed light on how his performance really went down with CNN execs. In response, he revealed the single piece of advice he was offered by the president of CNN, Jeff Zucker. “The only direction that I get every year from Jeff Zucker is: ‘Have fun,’” Andy said. “There you go. That is my job.” And, according to Andy, providing CNN viewers with some festive joy was his top priority — this year, more than ever. “It was not only a middling year,” he explained. “It ended in a car crash of COVID and Betty White dying on the day of New Year’s Eve, who everyone loved. So it was like, we’ve gotta kick it into gear. We’ve gotta have fun. A lot of people are at home spending their evenings with us.” But, while he may not be sorry, many of us know that a drunken night doesn't often go without consequences the next day. And so — like many others — Andy had a couple of regrets on Jan. 1. Speaking on his own SiriusXM radio show on Monday, the Watch What Happens Live host revealed that his “only regret” was making fun of Ryan Seacrest. Discussing the dig once again with Howard Stern on Tuesday, Andy revealed that he dropped the showbiz mogul a text the next day to apologize for throwing him “under the bus” on air. “I did wind up kind of starting to throw ABC under the bus, and that is my only regret from the night,” he said. ""Because I really like Ryan Seacrest. He’s a really nice guy."" He admitted: “I was kind of enjoying the rant! I was like, ‘It’s really fun being on CNN and just ranting like a nutty guy! This is fun!’ So I kept going, and that I felt bad about. And I texted Ryan the next morning.” Well, it seems that all’s well that ends well. And if Andy’s setting the tone for 2022, I think we can expect a lot of fun."

WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project.The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that. Advertisement     “It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect.In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.”This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023. Advertisement  Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California.But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself. Advertisement  A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later.Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input. Advertisement  The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?”
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water. Advertisement  “If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?”
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was.Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river. Advertisement  “Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.”The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.” Advertisement  While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions.“Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

The US set a global record on Monday with 1 million new COVID cases reported in a single day, as the highly contagious Omicron variant spreads and accounts for the majority of cases across the nation.The 1,017,376 cases recorded on Jan. 3 by the New York Times come with a few caveats: The long holiday weekend caused a backlog in reporting cases, which boosted the number reported on a single day. Meanwhile, testing has been hard to access, which means more people may be positive than what has been recorded. Advertisement     What we do know is that the country is in a very steep growth period for new cases, with a seven-day rolling average of 480,916. This new phase of the coronavirus pandemic has strained testing availability, disrupted businesses, and frustrated those who are fully vaccinated but catching Omicron, although the vaccines are reducing serious illness and death.
 


Still, the number of people hospitalized with COVID is surging past the peak of the Delta variant wave in early September 2021, and the percentage of PCR tests turning up positive is at the highest it’s ever been during the pandemic, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Advertisement     Bay Area resident Brittany McCulley woke up with a sniffly nose, itchy throat, and a minor cough Tuesday morning and immediately went to get tested for COVID. The 22-year-old hairstylist is 27 weeks pregnant, fully vaccinated, and received a booster dose to protect her from the virus. The test was positive.“I immediately started crying,” McCulley told BuzzFeed News, adding that she felt “absolutely horrified,” “scared,” and “exhausted” by the news. “I’m tired of people acting like nothing is going to affect them, that if they get it, it’s fine because it’ll be ‘mild,’ while it poses serious risks to other people around them.”
 


McCulley will now miss work and two prenatal doctor’s appointments over the next 10 days.“I’m going to struggle to pay bills now,” she said.She believes she was exposed at work because coworkers have also begun to feel sick. McCulley said her major concern is potential complications to her pregnancy, such as preterm labor (a risk researchers have stressed for pregnant people who contract the virus). Advertisement     People such as McCulley, who tested positive after the holidays, posted on social media about their need to change flights at the last minute or voiced concern that family members may also test positive.
 


Doctor's appointments, school schedules, and employers have all been thrown into a confusing reality about how to best mitigate the virus and continue in any form of normalcy. Those testing positive also said they are feeling ashamed of putting colleagues and loved ones at risk.“I’m frustrated more than anything because I wish I hadn’t exposed any of my coworkers, but I didn’t know,” said Lark W., who works at a rock climbing gym in Salt Lake City.Lark (who did not share their last name for privacy reasons) is fully vaccinated and has a booster shot scheduled for next week. They were exposed to COVID on Dec. 26 and took at-home tests on Dec. 29 and 30, each of which returned a negative result. Advertisement     “I did the best I could with the resources I had,” the 22-year-old told BuzzFeed News.Citing the negative tests, they made the decision to go to work. But over the holiday weekend, Lark started feeling sick. On Tuesday morning, they tested positive.“The fact that there’s so many cases makes it even more maddening that there’s absolutely no support,” they said. “I’m the ninth or tenth person at my job to test positive in the last couple months, and the best they’ve offered is reminding us of the three paid sick days we get per year.”But three days won’t make up for the extra seven days of lost income.“I don’t really care about the effect of this on my social life; I can spend 10 days at home no problem,” they said, “but I can’t afford to not work.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its isolation guidelines on Dec. 27, recommending a shorter five-day quarantine period for asymptomatic people, and then again on Tuesday with additional recommendations around antigen testing and travel.
 


Soaring cases are also coming at a time when high numbers of non-COVID patients are being admitted to emergency rooms for other reasons, experts say, straining resources. According to the HHS data, about 26% of ICU beds are being used for COVID cases as of Tuesday (of 5,448 national hospitals who report this data to the department). Advertisement     The federal government’s response has been to reiterate the importance of vaccination, the necessity of wearing a mask, and the value of testing and other available methods to stop the spread of the virus.“You can control how big an impact Omicron is going to have on your health,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday in remarks regarding the record number of reported cases. “If you’re unvaccinated, you have some reason to be alarmed.”Biden also announced that FEMA has been ordered to provide additional hospital beds and that his administration will double the number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID treatment pills to 20 million. The first batch of the FDA-approved oral drug was shipped out on Dec. 24.“They’re a game changer,” Biden said about the pill, which takes months to manufacture. “Production is in full swing.”But testing remains a frustration around the country, with long lines, a lack of rapid antigen tests, and few ways for people who test positive at home to report that to authorities. Starting next week, insurance providers will be required to reimburse people for at-home tests. Biden said a government website will launch later this month where people can request free at-home tests.The virus has also posed an issue for schools returning from the holiday break this week. Public school districts in Newark, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and Cleveland have even opted to revert to virtual learning amid the rise in cases, marking a regression to safety measures made early in the pandemic. Advertisement     Although the federal government is pushing hard for schools to remain open, many have struggled with staffing as teachers and administrators become ill themselves. And students who test positive risk falling behind as classes commence.
 


Tiki Duquella is a fully vaccinated student at a private high school in Knoxville, Tennessee. He tested positive for COVID on Tuesday and will have to miss a week of school and cancel a weekend trip to New York to visit friends. While his symptoms are “very minimal,” he said, he was glad a test confirmed they were COVID-related.“I went to get a test because my school started up again and I did not want to get my classmates/faculty sick,” Duquella said. Like so many in the country, he is already struggling to catch up just days into the new year. “It’s the first week, so I feel like it will be pretty difficult to start my second semester a week behind,” he said.Peter Aldhous contributed reporting to this story.

An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads. Advertisement     The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there. Advertisement     Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours. Advertisement     NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.”Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet. Advertisement     Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

A project led by one of the key creators of Google Glass, the tech giant’s influential but ultimately ill-fated smart eyewear, aims to let people have conversations without talking or using their hands to type, sign, or gesture.Called SilentSpeller, the project is a communication system that allows people to send texts using a high-tech dental retainer to spell out words without actually voicing them, according to a demo video and academic paper reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The device works by tracking the movement of the user’s tongue. Researchers claim the system identifies letters with 97% accuracy, and 93% accuracy for entire words. Advertisement     The research is the brainchild of Thad Starner, a pioneer in wearable technology. Starner played a lead technical role in developing Google Glass, the much-hyped device that helped introduce the world to a new genre of gadgets beyond smartphones. But the device courted controversy and pushed the bounds of society’s relationship with technology when Google introduced it almost a decade ago. SilentSpeller, by contrast, is a research project out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Starner is a professor, so the goal for now is more academic than product road map.However, the device could eventually be used to help people with movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, Starner told BuzzFeed News in an interview. He also sees potential consumer applications, like hands-free communication in really quiet places, like a library, or really loud places where people would have to strain their voices to be heard.To develop SilentSpeller, researchers didn’t create a whole new retainer from scratch. Instead, they jury-rigged an existing product called SmartPalate, which looks like the kind of retainer used by orthodontists but is loaded with tiny sensors to track tongue movement for speech therapy. Software creates a visual map of how someone’s tongue functions while speaking, but while SmartPalate’s primary use is to help people correct speech disorders, researchers working on SilentSpeller adapted the system to transform the retainer into a communications tool.
 


The device reads tongue movements through the retainer’s 124 sensors, according to the academic paper. The data is then sent to a personal computer or smartphone through a USB wire. For now that means that users of the prototype will have a wire dangling from their mouths, but researchers believe they could eventually create a wireless version that fits entirely in the mouth. The device requires a dental impression for a custom-fitting retainer. Although researchers have been working on the project since January 2020, progress has been slowed because the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of participants that could get fitted for custom retainers.The effort is not a Google project, but it has the fingerprints of the company’s researchers on it. Starner is still a part-time research scientist at Google focusing on machine learning. Another author on the academic paper is Alex Olwal, a senior Google research scientist that leads the company’s Interaction Lab, an initiative aimed at intertwining digital and physical experiences. Olwal is also a technical lead for Google’s augmented reality division.The demo video for the project, published on Olwal’s YouTube channel, features Olwal testing out the device. His eyes are blurred out, but a Google spokesperson confirmed it’s him.
 


Google Research, an arm of the company that focuses on pure science and technological breakthroughs, is credited as a collaborator in the demo video, but the company spokesperson, as well as Starner, said the effort was not considered a Google Research project.The lead researcher of the project, Naoki Kimura, is a graduate student from the University of Tokyo and an exchange student studying under Starner at Georgia Tech, Starner said. Other researchers on the project come from universities including Carnegie Mellon and the University of Washington. The project was presented in May at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, which normally takes place in Yokohama, Japan, but was held virtually amid the pandemic. The project, however, hasn't been widely known.Devices worn on — or in this case inside — the body have become a bigger focus of research over the last several years as tech becomes infused in more aspects of people’s lives. An Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram with sensors that track your heartbeat. Facebook’s parent company Meta makes virtual reality headsets for tapping into the so-called metaverse, which tech executives describe as an immersive world with a mix of both digital and physical elements. For years, Facebook was also developing a “brain-computer interface” with the goal of allowing people to communicate by imagining the words they wanted to type, but the company pulled the plug on that project in July. Google has created internet-connected jackets and bags, and for a time the company experimented with smart contact lenses with glucose readers for people with diabetes.But as people start to use more of these devices, privacy concerns have cropped up. A device that fits into a person’s mouth could open the door to invasive types of data collection, said John Davisson, senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. A nightmare scenario, he said, might be a company gathering information about a person’s saliva or dental records. While that’s a long-term concern for a new generation of devices that deal with biometric data, there’s no indication SilentSpeller would have the capability to do anything like that. Advertisement     “It’s sort of obvious, the sensitivity of a device that goes inside of your head,” Davisson said. “That’s going to present some privacy risks.” He added there would need to be strict safeguards on what information it could collect.In the academic paper for SilentSpeller, researchers list a handful of use cases. In addition to helping people with limited dexterity and other consumers, there might even be applications on the battlefield. One use case, according to the paper, is “United Nations operations where silent communication is key.” The corresponding drawing is of two heavily armored soldiers holding assault rifles. In speech bubbles, the soldiers discuss tactical strategy, presumably through SilentSpeller.This isn’t the first time Google scientists have worked with university researchers. Google has long had a tight-knit relationship with academia, stemming from the company's start as a Stanford University project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, then graduate students. For 15 years, the company awarded financial grants to academic researchers called the Google Faculty Research Awards. In 2020, the company discontinued that program and said it would instead focus on supporting up-and-coming researchers and faculty working on projects that serve underrepresented communities. That year, CNET reported on several projects funded by Google Research or developed by the Interaction Lab. They included temporary tattoos that transform a person’s body into a living touchpad when applied to the skin and sunglasses that project holographic icons.

Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

“I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that a paternity test has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son,” he continued.“I sincerely apologize to everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately,” he added.
 


“My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you,” Thompson continued. “I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”
 


One quote shared on Instagram on Dec. 31 read: “There’s going to be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change YOU. Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder. But don’t you go and become someone that you're not. Cry. Scream if you have to. Then you straighten out that crown and keep it moving.”Another quote posted weeks prior read: “To the woman who believed that this year would be a year of peace and genuine love, I’m sorry that these days, weeks and months have been so unkind to you. I know it may not feel like it at times but you are magic, you are what happens when a dream decides to go to war with nightmares. You are a symbol of strength and survival.” Advertisement     
 


Weighing in to refute the speculation, Kardashian tweeted, “That’s disappointing my face gave that expression. Halle Berry is such a force. Absolutely Stunning and beyond talented.”“I’m barely in my own body right now,” she continued. ""Please don’t read into anything. Also please don’t tear me apart because you assumed something.""
 


Craig also claimed that Thompson had cheated on her — with Kardashian — while she was pregnant with their son in 2016. Both Thompson and Kardashian have since denied the allegation, and instead maintained that the NBA player was single at the time.
 


“Instead of focusing on any negativity, I am choosing to embrace being a mother and doing the best I can for my son,” Nichols told People. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with [Thompson].”“My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment,” she said.

Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol. Advertisement     
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

392,Meet SilentSpeller: A smart retainer from one of the creators of Google Glass that could let you text with your tongue.,"


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless).""Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore."" Advertisement  Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year.""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year.""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities.""Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!"" Advertisement  Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly.""
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently.

My resolution is to take more intimate photos of people and places. I’ve spent the last couple of years photographing people either outside or indoors under extremely limited conditions (and always while having a low-level panic attack, thinking that I might be infecting people with COVID). I want to take the kinds of photos that you can only get by being close to someone for a prolonged period of time. The kinds that are only possible if COVID goes away.

393,Huge decisions will be made in the next few years about who gets water from the shrinking Colorado River. Basin tribes are fighting to get their share.,"


An “unprecedented” traffic jam amid a foot of snow and icy roads has forced hundreds of motorists to spend the night in their vehicles on Interstate 95 in Virginia between Richmond and Washington, DC.The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of road was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors: A winter storm dumped 12 inches of snow in the Fredericksburg area on Monday, freezing temperatures saw the roads turn to ice, trucks and tractor trailers slid and crashed into one another, downed trees turned into yet more roadblocks, and then yet more snow and ice accumulated around the disabled vehicles, making it exceedingly difficult for rescue workers to clear the roads. Advertisement     The chaos ensnared scores of drivers for interminable lengths of time, some of whom were driving home after the holidays, others doing what was supposed to be a quick errand.
 


""I thought I'd just throw the dogs in the car — it's only an hour drive, it should be fine,"" said Susan Phalen, who left for her house in Alexandria from her parents' home in Fredericksburg around 8 p.m. after they lost power there. Advertisement     Phalen said she was without internet when she set out on her journey and wasn't able to see warnings online to avoid the I-95 until it was too late.""The traffic rolled pretty easily around 20 mph for the first 4 or 5 miles, and then it came to an abrupt halt,"" she said.As time dragged on, Phalen began feeling despondent. ""You keep hoping for the best and thinking that any minute the traffic will go, and then the hours wear on,"" she said. ""It just gets frustrating.""
 


Phalen said that while she was able to stay warm by keeping her car idling due to a full tank of gas, she worried for those in the cars around her. If things got worse, she said, she thought she could try to escape on foot with her dogs, but she worried for older drivers or motorists with young children. Advertisement     ""What starts as a frustrating situation turns into a crisis for a lot of people,"" she said.Despondent motorists reported not seeing any state troopers or plows for hours, but Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) officials tried to assure them they were on the case.“We wish we had a timetable, ETA, or an educated guess on when travel will resume on I-95. It's at a standstill in our area with multiple incidents,” VDOT officials wrote on Twitter on Monday night. “It's frustrating & scary. Please know our crews don't stop.”VDOT said it was aware of some drivers who had been stuck on the interstate since Monday morning.“This is unprecedented,” VDOT Fredericksburg District Engineer Marcie Parker said in a statement, “and we continue to steadily move stopped trucks to make progress toward restoring lanes.”
 


Among those stuck was one of the state’s own senators, Tim Kaine, who wrote on Twitter that what should have been a two-hour drive from his home in Virginia to DC had ballooned into 19 hours. Advertisement     NBC News reporter Josh Lederman was another driver forced to spend the night with his dog in the backseat. As day broke, he began doing TV hits live from his stranded vehicle.
 


Gov. Ralph Northam said state officials had worked through the night to try to clear I-95.“​​State and local emergency personnel are continuing to clear downed trees, assist disabled vehicles, and reroute drivers,” Northam said. “An emergency message is going to all stranded drivers connecting them to support, and the state is working with localities to open warming shelters as needed.”Speaking in a Twitter Space for trapped motorists, one man said he survived the night by eating chocolate-covered cherries he had been gifted at Christmas. Another said he had been at a standstill since 11 p.m. just 1 mile from his house but didn’t want to abandon his car despite being frustratingly close to home.“My car was also stuck in the middle of the road. I didn’t know the situation,” he said. “Unless it’s valet, I ain’t leaving it.""It took until late Tuesday afternoon for VDOT to finally announce there were no longer any stranded people. ""Less than 20 vehicles left to be removed from the interstate before plow trains will come through to remove snow and ice from the travel lanes,"" officials said in a tweet. Advertisement     Phalen finally reached her Alexandria home around 16 hours after she had first set out, relieved that she was able to feed her dogs and shower. She was also looking forward to getting some rest after staying awake all night: ""I didn't sleep because I thought that sure enough I'll fall asleep and then the traffic will move and I'll be the one to slow things down.""

“I take full responsibility for my actions. Now that a paternity test has been established I look forward to amicably raising our son,” he continued.“I sincerely apologize to everyone I’ve hurt or disappointed throughout this ordeal both publicly and privately,” he added.
 


“My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you,” Thompson continued. “I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”
 


One quote shared on Instagram on Dec. 31 read: “There’s going to be very painful moments in your life that will change your entire world in a matter of minutes. These moments will change YOU. Let them make you stronger, smarter, and kinder. But don’t you go and become someone that you're not. Cry. Scream if you have to. Then you straighten out that crown and keep it moving.”Another quote posted weeks prior read: “To the woman who believed that this year would be a year of peace and genuine love, I’m sorry that these days, weeks and months have been so unkind to you. I know it may not feel like it at times but you are magic, you are what happens when a dream decides to go to war with nightmares. You are a symbol of strength and survival.” Advertisement     
 


Weighing in to refute the speculation, Kardashian tweeted, “That’s disappointing my face gave that expression. Halle Berry is such a force. Absolutely Stunning and beyond talented.”“I’m barely in my own body right now,” she continued. ""Please don’t read into anything. Also please don’t tear me apart because you assumed something.""
 


Craig also claimed that Thompson had cheated on her — with Kardashian — while she was pregnant with their son in 2016. Both Thompson and Kardashian have since denied the allegation, and instead maintained that the NBA player was single at the time.
 


“Instead of focusing on any negativity, I am choosing to embrace being a mother and doing the best I can for my son,” Nichols told People. “I do not want any further media attention, nor do I want a romantic relationship with [Thompson].”“My goal is to raise our son in a safe, healthy, loving and private environment,” she said.

396,One of the creators of Google Glass has been experimenting with a high-tech dental retainer that works as a communications tool by tracking the movement of your tongue.,"Andy Cohen has spoken out after his “stupid and drunk” New Year’s Eve rant on live TV. Andy attracted a lot of attention over the weekend after several comments he made live on CNN while hosting their annual New Year’s Eve Live from Times Square. During the live broadcast on Friday night, Andy and his cohost, Anderson Cooper, kicked off the festivities with several shots of what appeared to be tequila. As the night wore on and the alcohol seemingly took effect, Andy went on to throw shade at a string of public figures, including the likes of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. However — after admitting in an Instagram post the next morning that he was “a hair over-served” — Andy later confessed that his only regret from the drunken tirade was calling out Ryan Seacrest. In case you missed it, at one point during the show, Andy made a dig at ABC’s competing NYE show, hosted by Ryan — Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve — which was being broadcast simultaneously from elsewhere in Times Square. “There's a bunch of smoke coming from Ryan Seacrest's group of losers that are performing behind us,” Andy told CNN viewers. “If you've been watching ABC tonight, you've seen nothing, I'm sorry,” he added. Recalling the dig on his SiriusXM show three days later, the Bravo mogul admitted that he felt bad about criticizing the ABC broadcast, and by extension, its host. “The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing, is that I slammed the ABC broadcast,” Andy said on Monday. “I really like Ryan Seacrest and he's a great guy and I really regret saying that and I was just stupid and drunk and feeling it.” “I was continuing the Journey rant and I just kept talking and I shouldn't have and I felt bad about that, so that is the only thing,” he added. The host went on to admit that he wasn’t happy about how his comments about Ryan had been taken out of context by the media. “That’s the problem,” he said of the coverage. “The headlines about Ryan Seacrest are all like I trashed Ryan Seacrest and I really … I hope he hears the clip.” And while plenty of viewers were completely loving Andy’s drunken jabs on NYE, others weren’t so taken with the performance, which went on to spark reports that Andy had been fired by CNN as a result. However, it seems that all's well that ends well, as CNN appears to be standing by its host in spite of the backlash. In a new statement provided to BuzzFeed News today, CNN proceeded to shut down reports that Andy had been fired by the network. ""I can confirm that Andy Cohen will be back to co-host NYE on CNN next year,"" a CNN spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. And with that, we're already looking forward to this year's edition!"

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who sought to revolutionize healthcare with a device she claimed could make medical diagnoses using just a fingerprick of blood, has been found guilty of engaging in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors by making misleading and false statements about the technology’s capabilities.The jury reached the verdict on Monday after deliberating for more than 50 hours over seven days following a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including former employees, investors, doctors, and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services. Advertisement     Jurors needed to determine that Holmes intentionally defrauded investors and doctors and patients who used Theranos’s laboratory services in order to convict. The jury decided that Holmes conspired to defraud and defrauded investors, finding her guilty of four counts. She was found not guilty on four charges of conspiring to defraud and defrauding paying patients. The jury could not reach a verdict on three charges.“The jurors in this 15-week trial navigated a complex case amid a pandemic and scheduling obstacles,” US Attorney Stephanie Hinds said in a statement. “I thank the jurors for their thoughtful and determined service that ensured verdicts could be reached. The guilty verdicts in this case reflect Ms. Holmes’ culpability in this large scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes.”Now it will be up to a judge to determine her sentence at a later date. Each guilty count carries a maximum of 20 years in prison, plus a fine of $250,000. Holmes could also be ordered to pay restitution. One of the investment firms she was convicted of defrauding belongs to the DeVos family.Holmes didn't immediately react to the verdict as it was read, according to reporters in the courthouse.Holmes will likely receive a sentence that’s much shorter than what the law allows because she is a mother with a young child and does not have a criminal history, Diane Birnholz, a former federal prosecutor and lecturer in law at the UCLA School of Law, told BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     A Stanford University dropout who was once hailed as the next Steve Jobs, Holmes, 37, captivated investors — and the public — with her vision to make critical lab tests more accessible so that, as she famously repeated in interviews and appearances, “less people have to say goodbye too soon to people they love.”The device that Theranos developed was supposedly faster, cheaper, and more accurate than all other lab equipment on the market and capable of running hundreds of tests on just a few drops of blood. But as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in 2015, in reality, the machine, which was much smaller than other blood analyzers, could run only a small number of the tests, and its results were rife with inaccuracies. Instead, Theranos relied on commercially available machines to run most of its tests, diluting the drops of blood to increase volume for some tests and using much larger samples drawn from patients’ arms for others.The company eventually dissolved in 2018 after the Department of Justice indicted Holmes and her ex-boyfriend, Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, who was Theranos’s president and chief operating officer, on two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud each. Balwani is set to face a separate trial this year.The case had drawn fascination among people who watched the very public rise and fall of Holmes, whose deep voice, unflinching stare, and uniform of black turtlenecks and red lipstick were captured in a variety of promotional materials and interviews, as well as in documentaries and podcasts. A scripted series featuring actor Amanda Seyfried is in the works, as is a movie starring Jennifer Lawrence. At the core of many of these projects are similar questions: How far should a Silicon Valley startup go as it seeks to disrupt an industry? How could so many wealthy, powerful people buy into a failing business? And was Holmes a delusional dreamer or simply a person running a scam? Advertisement     
 


“Whether or not there are guilty or not guilty verdicts in this case, hopefully the federal indictment and trial have already sent a message to other executives and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be careful not to make material misrepresentations to potential investors and customers,” Birnholz said. “What matters is what’s true at the time you say something, not what you hope to be true in the future.”During the trial, prosecutors used emails, text messages, documents, audio recordings, and video clips of Holmes speaking in interviews, along with testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, to argue that she was clearly aware of problems with the company’s technology and still lied about its capabilities to get money. Prosecutors also told jurors Holmes lied about the company’s work with the military and pharmaceutical giants to entice potential investors and business partners to finance its operations. Advertisement     “The real version of Theranos, where the defendant went to work every day, was dramatically different than the rosy picture that she was painting for others,” Assistant US Attorney John Bostic told jurors. “The disease that plagued Theranos wasn’t a lack of effort. It was a lack of honesty.”During their deliberations, jurors asked to relisten to a key piece of evidence for prosecutors: the recording of a call Holmes had with investigators in 2013 in which she talked about the capabilities of the company’s technology, its work with pharmaceutical companies, the military, and retail partners, like Walgreens. During the call, which was secretly recorded by one of the investors Holmes was accused of defrauding, the former CEO said Theranos was focused on “work in the Middle East and specifically Afghanistan,” as she talked about “the potential to change survival rates” overseas by putting the company’s testing devices on military helicopters.“Military is a big deal for us,” Holmes told investors during the call. “We’ve been doing a lot of work there. We’ve also been doing a lot of work for Special Operations Command in the context of missions in remote areas.”Several investors testified that they came away from this call with the understanding that the military was actively using Theranos devices. But the company’s equipment was never deployed in medical helicopters or on the battlefield, Holmes confirmed in her own testimony, even as she disputed that she had ever told anyone that. Advertisement     During closing arguments, Holmes’ attorney Kevin Downey focused on Holmes' use of the word “potential” while discussing the company’s military work in this call and in other conversations, telling jurors, “She never says Theranos devices are currently being used.”Why then, Bostic asked jurors to consider, did investors, board members, and journalists leave those conversations with the understanding that she was talking about Theranos’s present-day capabilities?Throughout the trial, Holmes’ legal team portrayed the former CEO as a businessperson who worked diligently for years to make lab testing cheaper and more accessible. And despite admitting that she had made several mistakes along the way — and ultimately failed to disrupt healthcare as she set out to do — Holmes testified that she believed her company’s technology worked.“She believed in this technology, she stayed the whole time, and she went down with that ship when it went down,” Downey said during closing arguments.Over the course of seven days, Holmes, whose downfall attracted intense media coverage and public scrutiny, denied that she’d ever tried to mislead anyone, expressed regrets, deflected blame for the company’s problems, and said that Balwani had psychologically and sexually abused her during their decadelong relationship — claims that he denies.But prosecutors told jurors that the issue of whether she was truly a victim of abuse was separate from her actions as CEO.

398,This penguin couple went on a date in their empty aquarium ,"


2021 started off in uncertainty, with a dash of chaos, and most of us just strapped in and went along for the ride. In 2022, we’re hoping for better days ahead. No matter your stance on resolutions, the beginning of a year is a good time to check in and make some plans. We talked to some of our favorite photographers about their photo resolutions for 2022 — for the record, mine is to finally put down my mom’s camera from the ’70s and try a few new things.
 


DeSean McClinton-Holland""I’m surprised at how difficult it was for me to answer this question. With COVID spreading and businesses changing how they operate once again, it was hard to see a year that could be as productive or life-changing as this year was for me. Then a friend showed me Hello Future by Farah Al-Qasimi. That changed everything. Not only did it remind me of how much fun it is to make work with the people and objects around me, it also made me think of all the amazing work and books created during the height of the pandemic. With that in mind, I’m now inspired and hopeful that no matter what 2022 brings, anything is possible as long as I’m focused (and fearless).""Gabriella Angotti-Jones""My resolution for this next year is to continue making photos that reflect my personal history. This past year I really tried to take a step back from doing quick-hit daily assignments to focus on longer-term work that represented my own life and interests. I realized that a lot of my visual vocabulary is informed by my relationships and childhood growing up at the beach. I want to continue figuring out how this influences what I see and the kinds of photos I like to make. I want to get to know more nuanced emotions within myself so I can recognize that in the things and people I photograph. It’s cool because I feel like this is an ever-evolving thing and that this will always be something I get to explore."" Advertisement  Yael Malka""I don’t believe in making resolutions for the new year, because they are almost always a letdown. Resolutions like that put too much pressure on making big transformations, so I prefer to make goals in a more organic way throughout the year.""Something I have been working on this year and will continue to move towards in the new year is balance — perhaps that will be a lifelong feat? I want more balance between making my own work and making the work I get paid for. I want more balance between working and taking time for myself and not feeling guilty about it. I want to get better at remembering that productivity does not just come in the form of working, but also in relaxing, learning, and feeling joyful. Of course I also want to shoot really cool stories that I care about deeply and make tons of new work and exhibit it, but I also want to remember the importance of having those in-between moments — a lot of times that’s where the best ideas come out for me.""
 


Devin Yalkin""I'd love to have two books finished by the end of next year with a plane ticket to Paris Photo booked in tandem. The first book being the Vampire book I've been working on and then Alone Together, which is a body of work I've been working on since March of last year.""I would love to have a solo exhibition in the making somewhere in Los Angeles, where I'll be moving to next month. Also to find an agent to get bigger commercial jobs so I can have more time in between to work on personal projects.""Imdad Barbhuyan""I transitioned from architecture and started making images right at the beginning of 2020. So my journey of exploring photography as a medium — communicating and exchanging thoughts and ideas, all within the bounds of the digital/social media landscape.""So this coming year I wish to be free of that constraint; I wish to engage wholeheartedly with the physical world in a deeper sense — through observation, creation, and dissemination of my work. I have always been a tactile person; I wish to try to explore the physicality of art itself. Returning to creating something tangible is something I really look forward to.""Besides wanting to be able to meet more people in real life, collaborating and creating portraits of individuals, I wish to be able to travel and make images from different places and cultures. I have gotten too comfortable. I want to put myself in unfamiliar situations, push my horizons, and surprise myself."" Advertisement  Hannah Gottlieb-Graham""I recently worked on an incredible project with Google Pixel and SN37 — the fifth edition of Creator Labs, a long-standing partnership and visual arts incubator providing resources to photographers and filmmakers to document personal work grounded in social impact and made on the Google Pixel 6. I’m interested to see how new camera technologies develop in more equitable and inclusive ways for professional photographers and everyday users alike, and this project was a great way for me to start thinking about that resolution.""
 


Cheney Orr""As I write this, I am just coming off a 10-day assignment for Reuters covering the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that ripped through several US states, focusing much of its fury on Mayfield, Kentucky, where dozens were killed and neighborhoods left unrecognizable. A key photographic goal for 2022 is to continue to follow this community as it strives to find resilience in the face of deeply inflicted trauma and unimaginable loss. These stories are often ignored once a disaster is out of the headlines. Advertisement  ""Another major photo goal is to continue developing a story that looks at how one of America’s most underserved communities is also dealing with one of the nation’s highest rates of Alzheimer’s, a disease that took the life of my own dad. Entering this new year, I want to remind myself to point my camera at my own family, friends, and loved ones. At the end of the day, these are the images that I will forever hold the closest.""
 


Adam Perez""For the past year and a half, I’ve been working on a photo project titled Pandemic in the Heartland, chronicling how the pandemic has devastated California’s Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of our country’s food. My resolution for 2022 is to expand the project into a public art campaign, entitled ""Ve Me"" (See Me), that aims to bring the work back into the community. The idea is to meet the community where they’re at. Many are farmworkers, driving across the region, following the crop season. My plan is to display the photos and quotes on billboards off of Highway 99, a major artery that connects many Central Valley rural communities.""Myrtille Beauvert""More than ever, it’s important to support the wonderful organizations that make photography available to the world through exhibitions, artist discussions, and publications. Whether it’s by being a regular patron or an avid reader or just staying curious about new work being produced, I want to acknowledge and appreciate as much as possible the work of museums, galleries, publishers, and media to champion photography in all its diversity. In 2022, I look forward to supporting meaningful photo projects both privately and professionally!"" Advertisement  Hanifa Haris""The tradition of New Year's resolutions is approximately 4000 years old, it's said to have originated among ancient Babylonians. As I sit at my computer on a winter's eve in LA, contemplating my resolutions for next year, my insignificance (as it relates to the history of the world) is not lost on me. As the Creative Director, Head of Photography at Verizon, I'm grateful every day to do the work that I do. I get to work with some of the best creatives in the world and have fun while doing it.""In 2022, I want to commit to harnessing a creative space for discourse while continuing to advocate for equitable storytelling and fostering inclusive environments for artists globally. In the last two years, I've seen, heard, and taken part in a lot of conversations about inclusion, equity, and representation. I'd like to take it further and have discussions about the nuances within this space and the impact on visual culture, image-making, [and how it interacts with] the history of photography and the photography industry at large. For me, 2022 will be focused on actionable impact, both systemic and personal. Personally, I've been developing a couple of projects that I'm excited to share publicly.""
 


Sinna Nasseri""Mainly, I’m getting the itch to hit the road again. After a manic 2020 where I was constantly on the move, 2021 was a lot more stable. I only drove across the country once this year! I miss the feeling of being in motion, forced to make something happen every day. So I guess my main resolution is to put myself into more uncomfortable situations. And also I think it’s time for a long trip to Turkey and Iran to find out about my ancestral homeland.""Polly Irungu""My personal photo resolution this year is to build my archive and document my immediate and external family more frequently. If this pandemic taught us anything, it is that time is precious and limited.""My second personal resolution is to create a personal project every quarter. I need to carve out more space to photograph the things I deeply care about with no pressure from a client or worrying about algorithms. It's the personal projects that help me remember my 'why.'""My last resolution is to continue building and growing the Black Women Photographers organization — for Black women and nonbinary photographers to be seen, celebrated, and hired — all year round. There is still so much work to be done for us to receive proper equity and inclusion in the industry.""Nolwen Cifuentes""My photo resolution for 2022 is to focus on community.

At least two people are still missing, presumed dead, and almost 1,000 homes and other structures were destroyed after a fast-moving wildfire swept through suburban areas northwest of Denver, Colorado officials said Sunday.The blazes sparked on Thursday destroyed some 991 structures and damaged 127 others in the town of Superior and city of Louisville, as well as unincorporated Boulder County. Advertisement     Entire neighborhoods were burned to the ground, with federal officials touring the area Sunday to see the damage for themselves, including scores of burned-out vehicles, some abandoned in the middle of the road by people fleeing. “The pictures that I was seeing on the television before today don’t even come close to what you see when you look at it in person — the amount of devastation,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters at a press briefing.The fires burned more than 6,000 acres, whipped by wind gusts of over 105 mph that propelled them through abnormally dry conditions in the area.But in surreal scenes that reflected the wild environmental conditions, 8 inches of snow began falling in the area Friday, ultimately helping to extinguish the blazes.“The snow is an awesome thing for fire behavior,” Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said Saturday, “and it’s a hard thing for crime scene and recovery efforts and damage assessments and all those things. So it’s a mixed blessing.” Advertisement     “In a few places, there’s still smoldering debris and smoke partially covered by snow,” Gov. Jared Polis said Sunday. “It’s really an odd and disturbing juxtaposition.”There had been no fatalities reported in the immediate aftermath of the fires, but officials now say at least two people whose homes were destroyed are missing. A third person who had been missing Saturday has since been accounted for.“We’re very fortunate that we don’t have a list of 100 people missing,” Pelle said.Officials were set to use cadaver dogs to try to locate the individuals’ bodies, but the conditions were still extremely dangerous for recovery workers.“The debris is hot, it’s all fallen in, and it’s now covered with 8 inches of snow, so search and recovery efforts are hampered substantially,” Pelle said.
 


Local officials originally suspected downed power lines had sparked the blazes, but that, too, has changed, according to Pelle.Investigators have not found any credible evidence of any such downed lines. Instead, they have mounted what Pelle described as a “very active investigation” into other possible causes.

We are now looking at yearlong fires.""Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious circle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels.Local, state, and federal officials are on the ground in Colorado to assist people in finding housing and dealing with insurance companies, but Polis said many residents are still in shock.“For many, it seems like a surreal experience,” he said. “Just a few days ago, you were celebrating Christmas at home and hanging your stockings, and now home and hearth have been destroyed, and it’s a shock.

400,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


US health officials may again revise guidelines that recently shortened the isolation period for asymptomatic people with COVID-19 to recommend that they test negative for the virus, the White House’s top medical adviser said Sunday.The guidance released by the CDC last week halved the number of days that people infected with the coronavirus who are not exhibiting symptoms need to isolate themselves from 10 to five, followed by five days of wearing a “well-fitting” mask in public. Advertisement     But scientists told BuzzFeed News they were surprised and alarmed there was no recommendation that people produce a negative test prior to reentering public life. Some speculated it was because many Americans were struggling to obtain rapid antigen tests.“There has been some concern about why we don’t ask people at that five-day period to get tested. That is something that is now under consideration,” National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said in an interview Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “The CDC is very well aware that there has been some pushback about that.”He added, “Looking at it again, there may be an option in that — that testing could be a part of that — and I think we’re going to be hearing more about that in the next day or so from the CDC.”
 


Fauci’s comments suggest something of a reversal for the CDC and the White House, which had previously defended the lack of a testing requirement.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week that the organization did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious.“On the other hand, we know that after five days, people are much less likely to transmit the virus, and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said.Officials said that with hundreds of thousands of Americans testing positive each day as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps the US, the shorter isolation period for asymptomatic individuals was necessary to keep the country running.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” Fauci told CNN last week. “But if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs, to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”
 


In his interview Sunday, Fauci said there was accumulating evidence that the Omicron variant leads to less serious infection and illness, especially in vaccinated individuals, but officials are still concerned that hospitals may be overwhelmed.Because of Omicron’s infectiousness, record numbers of Americans are testing positive. But Fauci said the US should shift its primary focus away from case numbers to hospitalizations.“I’m still very concerned about the tens of millions of people who are not vaccinated at all, because even though many of them are going to get asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, a fair number of them are going to get severe disease,” Fauci said.

Twitter permanently blocked the personal account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday for her repeated violations of the website’s policies on COVID-19 misinformation.“We’ve been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. Advertisement     The suspension was prompted by a tweet Greene authored on New Year’s Day in which she called COVID vaccines “dangerous” and falsely said that “extremely high amounts of covid vaccine deaths are ignored.”It was her fifth such violation of the misinformation policy. Under Twitter’s rules, her previous violations caused her to lose access to the account for between 12 hours and seven days.Her previous false tweets said, among other things, that the vaccines were “failing” and that COVID was dangerous only to people who are obese or over 65.Greene’s account had more than 465,000 followers at the time of its suspension.The Georgia Republican is not technically banned from Twitter, since she will still have access to the account for her congressional office, @RepMTG.But that account, which has more than 387,000 followers, could be banned if Greene uses it to violate Twitter’s rules.It is customary for US lawmakers to maintain separate accounts on social media because they are prohibited from fundraising and other campaign activities on their official government channels. Advertisement     In a defiant message posted on Telegram after her suspension, Greene said, ""Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth.""Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.Former president Donald Trump was banned from the platform almost a year ago following the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”Greene, who has supported Qanon and trafficked in nonsensical and racist conspiracies, has been one of the loudest voices in her party spreading misinformation during the pandemic.But she is not alone among the GOP.On Friday, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee deleted a tweet from their official account that falsely said booster shots don’t work.According to scientists and medical authorities, COVID vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious illness, even against more contagious variants, such as Omicron and Delta.The vaccines have been rigorously tested and are now under the most intense safety monitoring in US history, according to the CDC.More than 4.5 billion people around the world have received a dose.

402,The horror gridlock along both directions of the 50-mile stretch of Interstate 95 was the result of a nightmarish confluence of factors.,"


Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

403,“You brought an editing mistake of a mislabeled photograph to our attention.”,"


A private intelligence business owned by a lead FBI agent in the Michigan kidnapping case may have tainted the “good faith and integrity of the investigation,” defense attorneys are arguing in a new court filing.The agent, Jayson Chambers, was the primary handler for a confidential informant who infiltrated the armed militant group Wolverine Watchmen and who played a central role in building the case that they allegedly plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. In August, BuzzFeed News revealed that Chambers had registered a business called Exeintel that was linked to an internet troll who appeared to have tweeted about the case before it became public. Advertisement     
 


Earlier this month, prosecutors said that the government would not be calling on Chambers to testify at the federal trial in the case, slated to begin March 8, and that discussion of the agent’s “extrinsic” business should not be permitted — even if defense attorneys call him as a witness. But in their Friday filing, attorneys for all five federal defendants facing trial claim that Exeintel is relevant because it represents an “apparent conflict of interest” and they should be permitted to explore the topic at trial.In materials circulated in 2019 to promote Exeintel, Chambers cited his casework with the FBI, which the defense lawyers said proves he “was attempting to leverage his success in criminal investigations performed for the FBI for his personal profit.” By extension, they claim, it’s possible that Chambers had financial motivation for the kidnapping investigation to result in arrests — and that could explain behavior by the agent they characterize as an attempt to entrap their clients.The government charged six men with conspiring to kidnap the sitting governor in October 2020. One subsequently pleaded guilty, while five others — Brandon Caserta, Barry Croft, Adam Fox, Kaleb Franks, and Daniel Harris — maintain their innocence and claim the government “initiated” and directed the entire conspiracy. Last week, they asked for the indictment to be dismissed because of “egregious overreaching” by the government, which employed at least a dozen confidential informants during the probe.Federal prosecutors have denied those allegations, claiming the men were predisposed to commit the crimes. The Michigan attorney general's office has similarly defended its case against eight additional men who were charged with providing material support to terrorism.To underscore their theory of predisposition, prosecutors are seeking to admit evidence of prior criminal activity by several of the defendants, including two convictions by Croft in the 1990s and one by Franks in 2013. In new filings, defense attorneys say the government “mischaracterizes” the offenses to make them appear more serious, but in fact they bear “no resemblance to the charged offense” and thus have “no value with regard to showing propensity.” An attorney for Croft also noted that he was fully pardoned by the governor of Delaware for both of those convictions in 2018.A spokesperson for the FBI referred a request for comment to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has previously declined to discuss the kidnapping case. Jayson Chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A particular challenge for prosecutors in what is arguably the highest-profile domestic terrorism case in the country — other than those related to the Capitol insurrection — has been the conduct of the FBI agents in the probe.One agent, Richard Trask, who was held out as the public face of the case, was fired after being charged with beating his wife in July. A second agent, Henrik Impola, has been accused of perjury in a different case, and in a filing Friday, defense attorneys asked the court’s permission to question him on the stand about that allegation, which prosecutors have termed “unfounded.”According to evidence shared by the government and cited by defense lawyers in their filing, Chambers may have played a far more important role in the case than the other two. Records show he wrote 227 reports on contacts with the confidential informant known as “Dan,” compared with just five written by Impola and zero by Trask.Dan, court testimony shows, helped initiate the case in March 2020 and made hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings of the defendants, accompanying them on trips to meetings and training exercises and often paying for their travel expenses. A text message sent by Chambers to Dan in September 2020 stated, “Mission is to kill the governor specifically.”The FBI has declined to state whether Chambers sought permission from the bureau to register a business while still working full time as an agent. Prosecutors have said that he never made any money from Exeintel and that he abandoned plans to quit the FBI. But public records show that Chambers did not formally dissolve his company until Oct. 29 of this year, “meaning he owned the company throughout the entire investigation of the alleged plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,” defense attorneys wrote Friday.

This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context. Advertisement     On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes). We typically use these to test our colleagues in the newsroom, but we publish them for the readers who are so inclined to take them. Here’s one from July with the theme of TikTok trends, and a supernatural style quiz from October.Finally, don’t miss our favorite year-end traditions: The Best, Worst, and Funniest Corrections and The Best Grammar Memes and Tweets (most of which are from us — what about it? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).What's New?Here are some of the additions and changes we made to the style guide in 2021!ableist terms: added alternatives words to use instead of those that have ableist connotations or make light of disabilities (instead of crippled or handicapped, use hampered, obstructed, or inhibited; instead of tone-deaf, use insensitive, obtuse, or oblivious).Afghan (citizens of Afghanistan), afghani (currency)antisemitism (no hyphen)copy desk (replaced copydesk); copy editor (n.)coronavirus pandemic: Capitalize the Greek alphabet name assigned to a variant by the WHO, e.g., the Omicron variant.disinformation: the intentional spreading of false or misleading information, often for political gain (e.g., a disinformation campaign); misinformation refers to falsehoods more generally, without a specific intentfirst gentleman: like first family and first lady, always lowercase as they’re not formal titles, e.g., first lady Jill Biden (first partner, anyone?)older adults or older person/people: Use these rather than senior citizens, seniors, or elderly. Do not use the elderly to refer to a group, as the term is vague and can be dehumanizing. Include age specifics when possible (e.g., “People 65 and over qualify”).

405,"The verdict came after a lengthy trial that featured testimony from more than 30 witnesses, including Holmes herself.","


This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


Marie Bergum wanted the chance to live her own life — and make her own mistakes. Her father said that could not happen.
 


Marie was in her 30s and had an intellectual disability. As a teenager, she lived a mostly independent life like other teens and took the bus to a job at McDonald’s, where she helped work the cash register. Marie also cooked at home and took care of the dogs.
 


After her parents divorced, her father, Jim, became her legal guardian.
 


Marie did not understand what this meant when she agreed to it, and she later decided she did not want her father to be her legal guardian. (In California, where Marie is from, they call legal guardians ""conservators,"" and guardianships ""conservatorships."") Advertisement     
 


She wanted to learn how to do things like budgeting and making medical decisions instead of her father doing them for her. She said, “I need help with life!” and later said, “But I want them to show me, not do it for me.”
 


Marie worked together with some lawyers and family members who believed she could make her own decisions. She had to be careful that her father did not know about her meetings with them.
 


Sometimes Marie had to be sneaky by calling her supporters from the gym locker room because she felt she had no privacy at home. This was a risk — she said if her dad found out she was on the phone instead of lifting weights, he would call her a liar or follow her the next time she left the house. Marie said if he knew she was trying to fight for freedom to make her own decisions, he might take her phone away from her.
 


Marie’s lawyers told the courts that Jim was controlling her money, not allowing her to have sex with boyfriends, keeping her away from people he didn’t like, verbally abusing her by calling her “stupid” and “fat,” and moving her from city to city without including her in the decision. Marie told court officers that Jim did not allow her to have a lock on her door, take public transportation, cook meals, or choose how much money she could spend each week. “He started saying that I couldn’t do things because I wasn’t that smart,” Marie told BuzzFeed News. “Everything was taken away, a little bit every year.”
 


Jim told BuzzFeed News he loved his daughter, and the world was full of dangers and people looking to take advantage of her. He said, “My job is to protect her and put her on the path that she can succeed as best as she can.” He said his rules stopped her from making mistakes she might later wish she did not make. Jim said that he wanted his daughter to be happy and that being her guardian was the best way to achieve that because she, unfortunately, was not as capable as she thought she was. Jim said many of Marie’s accusations were wrong, but he didn’t take them personally.
 


There are many more stories like Marie’s. People with disabilities often must speak up for “dignity of risk”: the right to make choices freely, good and bad, to learn from and live full lives. Disability rights experts say that everyone, especially young adults, deserves the chance to make mistakes and learn from them. Advertisement     
 


Experts say it can be hard to get freedom from legal guardians who are family members. Many parents of children with disabilities get guardianship as soon as the child turns 18 because schools tell them they should. This is called the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Even if parents want to end the guardianship later, it can be hard to do so.
 


There are other options for people with disabilities to get support that do not take away their rights to make decisions. Supported decision-making allows people to choose who will help them make decisions instead of having another person take over the person’s life and make choices for them. Advertisement     
 


Disability rights experts say that supported decision-making can work for many people with disabilities. Researchers learned that when people with disabilities make their own decisions, they are more likely to have jobs and be healthier, happier, and more involved in their communities. Even the National Guardianship Association said supported decision-making is a “promising” measure that “should be considered for the person before guardianship.”
 


Marie filed to end her guardianship in March 2018. She wrote, “My human rights are being violated.” Her father disagreed and told the court, “I hate to say this, but it is a proven truth, that I must not only save Marie from outside predators just waiting for an opportunity, but Marie often requires being saved from herself and her own lack of ability to decide what is healthy and safe for her.” The judge allowed Jim to continue having control over Marie’s life. Advertisement     
 


Soon after, Marie got new lawyers so she could try again to gain her freedom. She created a supported decision-making plan and assigned family members to support her in different parts of her life, such as budgeting, housing, completing job applications, making medical decisions, cooking, making educational plans, and staying safe. This time she won, and the court removed Jim as her guardian.
 


Marie’s Aunt Nancy, together with a program manager from an advocacy center, will be her guardians for one year. Then a judge will decide if Marie can successfully live without a guardian. The court said Jim can never again be Marie’s guardian. “Jim can’t do anything to me anymore,” she said with a wide grin. Advertisement     
 


“Be persistent. Your dreams can come true. Don’t let anyone in your family tell you you can’t do things.”

Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol. Advertisement     
 


When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

408,Greene is the first member of Congress to have her personal political account banned from Twitter.,"


Betty White, the beloved television icon whose career spanned eight decades, died Dec. 31 just weeks before she was to turn 100.Her agent, Jeff Witjas, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a statement to People, he confirmed her death.""Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,"" Witjas said. ""I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don't think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again."" Advertisement     Los Angeles authorities confirmed that officers responded to her address for what was believed to be a ""natural cause of death,"" but did not provide further details. Fire officials said they responded to a ""medical aid request"" and confirmed the death of a 99-year-old woman.White was best known for her role as naive St. Olaf, Minnesota, native Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, which ran from 1985 to 1992 and earned White an Emmy Award and six nominations. Earlier this week, White told People that she felt ""so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age.""
 


While her part on the endlessly rerun series may have gotten her the most name recognition, White's career began long before The Golden Girls and went on for decades after.Her first TV appearance was in 1939, a few months after her high school graduation. She began working in radio in the 1940s before getting her first regular TV gig on the variety show Hollywood on Television in 1949. In 1951, she was nominated for an Emmy in the Best Actress on Television category, the very first time the award was given (it went to Gertrude Berg). Advertisement     
 


White worked steadily through the ’60s and ’70s, with memorable appearances on game shows like What's My Line?, Match Game, and Password. She married Password host Allen Ludden in 1963, and they remained together until his death in 1981. (""I had the love of my life,"" White told Anderson Cooper in 2011. ""If you've had the best, who needs the rest?"")In 1973, White began her stint as Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She proved adept at capturing the contrast between Nivens' sweet on-air persona as ""the Happy Homemaker"" and her sarcastic, sexually voracious real-life demeanor. She won two Emmys for her performance.After The Mary Tyler Moore Show ended in 1977, White continued to take on guest and recurring TV roles. In 1983, she became the first woman to win a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host (for the NBC series Just Men!). Two years later, she landed her career-defining part on The Golden Girls. White was originally considered for the role of Blanche, but director Jay Sandrich believed she should do something different after playing man-hungry so memorably on Mary Tyler Moore.
 


For the rest of her career, White would continue to take on roles where she played up the surprising dirty side behind her sweet exterior.While she continued acting after the cancellation of The Golden Girls in 1992 — and its ill-fated spinoff, The Golden Palace, in 1993 — her major resurgence didn't begin until the late 2000s, thanks to her role in the 2009 romantic comedy The Proposal and a 2010 grassroots campaign that propelled White into hosting Saturday Night Live. At age 88, she became the oldest person to host the show. That same year, White joined the cast of TV Land's Hot in Cleveland. Her character, Elka Ostrovsky, was written just for the pilot, but White's performance had her upgraded to a regular for all six seasons of the series.
 


Outside of acting, White was a devoted animal rights advocate, working for decades with organizations such as the Morris Animal Foundation and the Los Angeles Zoo Commission. She was awarded the American Veterinary Medical Association's Humane Award in 1987.Beyond her charity work, White was a symbol of making the most out of one's later years: She enjoyed the most popularity and acclaim at an age when most people are long retired. When she was awarded the Guinness World Record for longest TV career for a female entertainer, White said, ""I have no regrets at all. None. I consider myself to be the luckiest old broad on two feet.""News of White's death sparked an outpouring of grief and remembrances on social media. Former SNL cast member Seth Meyers said the Golden Girl was the only celebrity host he saw get a standing ovation at the show's afterparty. ""A party at which she ordered a vodka and a hotdog and stayed til the bitter end,"" Meyers tweeted.Ryan Reynolds, who starred alongside White in The Proposal, said on Instagram, ""The world looks a little different now"" without his grandma Annie.""She was great at defying expectation,"" Reynolds wrote. ""She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We’ll miss you, Betty. Now you know the secret.""In a statement, their costar Sandra Bullock said she would do as White did.""I don’t drink vodka … but I will tonight, on ice, with a slice of lemon with a hot dog on the other side and just be okay being sad,"" Bullock said. ""I’ll have to buy some rose-colored glasses because Betty was that for all of us.""
 


Jamie Lee Curtis remembered her You Again costar as ""full of love and creativity and integrity and humor and dedication and a life of service to animals"" in an Instagram post.""What women WANT is to live a life like Betty White,"" Curtis wrote. ""Rest easy you beautiful woman. We will carry on for you!""
 


Kathy Griffin shared a touching tribute in a Twitter thread, talking about the times she spent with White while on set.""She treated me like we were in the same club or something. She actually treated me like an equal in the comedy gurrrl world,"" Griffin wrote. ""She was as sharp and funny as she was soft and wise and no matter how long this world continues to spin, there will be only one Betty White."" Advertisement     
 


Mitchell Hurwitz, a TV writer and producer who worked on The Golden Girls, remembered White for her quick wit.""She was such an incredibly special person, so funny, so warm - and so strong,"" Hurwtiz tweeted. ""And I have a feeling she lied about her age and actually made it to 100.""

On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.) Advertisement     In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016.5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split.Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.” Advertisement     7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe). Advertisement     Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later.

WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme.

A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats).The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.”15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”). Advertisement     Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself.What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post. Advertisement     20. White Girl Dancing
 


Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy. Advertisement     22. Naur
 


“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast. Advertisement     23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting. Advertisement     The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part. Advertisement     People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used. Advertisement     Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard. Advertisement     People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

This is Part 3 in a Colorado River Series. For Part 2, click here.On a 120-degree day, as waves of hot air shimmer above deeply cracked earth, it is difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago this land was part of a vast 2-million-acre expanse of blue waters and verdant trees that formed the delta of the Colorado River. Once robust enough for steamships to cross, the delta supported a thriving ecosystem with thousands of migratory birds and wetland species. Now, a bleached skeleton of a crab is one of the few signs of life remaining.The delta’s disappearance was the first indication that modern management of the river was pushing the system past its capacity. Starting in the 1930s, construction of major dams and diversions redirected water from the river to reservoirs, farms, and cities from Denver to Los Angeles. By 1960, water stopped regularly flowing to the delta, and over time, 90% of its 2 million acre expanse withered.“The river is so altered and contained now, I call it a big canal,” said Nora McDowell, who served as chair of the Fort Mojave Tribe for 25 years and actively leads efforts to protect the Colorado River. “This isn’t the river we knew. It used to be just wild. Where I swam, the water was blue and it was clean. It was our playground. … I remember it as a great blue lagoon.”The Colorado River is now at a tipping point, with implications stretching far beyond its delta. Water levels at the Lake Mead and Lake Powell reservoirs, which depend on snowmelt to feed the river, reached historic lows this year. For over two decades, Western states sharing the river have relied on water from these reservoirs to insulate their residents from feeling the impacts of a relentless 22-year megadrought.
 


But in August, water levels in the reservoirs dropped low enough to trigger the first-ever federal shortage declaration, which will cut states’ 2022 river usage by billions of gallons. More cuts are likely: 2021 was the second-driest water year on record, and a growing body of data indicates what we are seeing is not a temporary drought, but a permanently hotter, more arid environment and a significantly smaller Colorado River.Successfully managing water shortages in the short term, while developing solutions for the management of the Colorado River in the long term, is imperative for the 40 million people who depend on its waters. Ultimately, the crisis on the Colorado River is a story about how the United States chooses to adapt to climate change.Current projections indicating another dry year are “a stark reminder that we need to continue to do more,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said at the recent Colorado River water users conference. “In addition to the short-term emergency decisions we will be making, we also need to be very real about the challenge of building long-term solutions in this basin.”This month, Arizona, California, Nevada, and the federal government announced a plan to temporarily address water shortages. The plan commits $200 million toward projects to stabilize Lake Mead and leave billions more gallons of water in the river through 2023. Advertisement  Looking ahead, however, a fundamental question looms for those sharing the river: The current drought contingency policies, which govern how the parties share cuts during times of water shortage, will expire in 2026. They were designed to be temporary, but it appears increasingly clear that a drier climate may be a permanent reality for the southwest. So now it must be resolved: What will happen when those agreements expire? And who will make those decisions?
 


A seat at the tableSince the 1920s, management of the river has been dominated by the seven Western states that signed the 1922 Colorado River Compact. A foundational document guiding how the river is managed, the compact split the river’s water between the “upper basin” states of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico and the “lower basin” states of Nevada, Arizona, and California.But it failed to allocate water for the 30 sovereign tribes of the Colorado River Basin (a majority of which have water rights that predate the compact), the northern states of Mexico, where the river ends, or for the health of the river itself. Advertisement  A century later, with clear evidence of the consequences of these exclusions, the region’s sovereign tribes and conservation groups are pushing for a seat at the table with the states and the federal government as they approach negotiations to set new rules for post-2026 management of the river.To this day, the basin’s 30 sovereign tribes aren’t formally part of the decision-making bodies governing the Colorado River, despite holding water rights to 20% of its water, an amount greater than allocated to some states in the region.Daryl Vigil, co-facilitator of the Water & Tribes Initiative, a leading group in the Colorado River Basin advocating for more equitable and sustainable policies, says tribes need an institutionalized way to engage in policy-making. “Without this, we cannot exercise our sovereignty or right to self-determination,” he said.The basin tribes were not included in 2007 intrastate and federal negotiations to develop the first interim guidelines responding to drought conditions. In 2012, when basin states and the Department of Interior completed a study to “assess current and future water and supply imbalances,” the water usage and rights of the tribes were not adequately considered, leading to a separate study that was published years later.Despite being marginalized, the basin’s tribes are taking on a leadership role as water shortages have deepened, offering solutions and being among the first water users to contribute water to support critical drought plans.In 2019, The Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes' willingness to conserve water was critical to the success of drought contingency plans. In the recent $200 million deal to conserve additional water through 2023, the Gila River Indian Community and the Colorado River Indian Tribes collectively contributed over a quarter of the water pledged. Yet the underlying framework that currently guides the river’s operations was made without their input. Advertisement  The basin tribes’ continued involvement in the process depends on executive memorandums and statements of commitment. No legally binding documents or formally established positions guarantee them a place in the bodies that govern the river.“The [1922] compact talks about an equitable apportionment of water in the Colorado River Basin, but when it was created, my tribe was living on subsistence rations in a place that wasn’t our homeland. So much of the current framework surrounding this river is based on legislation and policy that tribes have had no formal access to,” Vigil said. “You have 30 tribal sovereigns in the Colorado Basin that have lived sustainably here for thousands of years. Why aren’t we including people in the conversation who have known how to live resiliently?”
 


In a recent letter to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, leaders from 20 tribes in the basin called on her to ensure tribal sovereigns have a clear role in upcoming negotiations to develop the next framework governing the Colorado River. The letter also announced the creation of a Colorado River Basin Tribal Coalition, where leaders will gather to build consensus on new policies, and asked the Interior Department to encourage states to meaningfully engage with tribes in their internal and interstate negotiations. Advertisement  Tribal water rights are considered as part of states’ overall allocations of water from the river. As tribes reach water settlements, states have to account for this water from their portion of the river. But with increasing pressure on states to cut existing water usage during shortages, the interests of state water managers do not always align with the interests of the basin’s tribes as they actualize their water rights.Responding to the tribes’ letter, Haaland wrote that the Interior Department intends to hold “listening sessions” with tribal leadership in 2022. Trujillo, who is tasked with leading that process, said in an interview that the department will incorporate feedback into future negotiations, but she declined to specify if they would formally establish a place for tribal leaders.
 


As the basin’s tribes push for representation in upcoming negotiations for the river’s future, they are navigating a related inequity — access to clean water.Despite holding significant rights to the Colorado River, many of the basin’s tribes lack water security. On Navajo Nation, the largest reservation in the basin, 30 to 40 percent of residents lack indoor plumbing and haul water to meet their basic needs. Compared to other Americans, Navajo residents are 67 times more likely to live without access to running water. Advertisement  “If we look at these issues through the lens of people not having access to water, they are just different aspects of the same fundamental problem,"" said Bidtah Becker, Associate Attorney for the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority. “Have we separated water issues so far that we no longer see the connection between the shortages of water currently being experienced on the river and the fact that there are people in this basin who do not have access to clean water from that very river?”
 


Water shortage as an opportunityMany conservation groups active in the Colorado River Basin view the post-2026 negotiations as a chance to build a management system that’s flexible enough to respond to the impacts of climate change as the river shrinks. With billions in federal funding newly allocated in the 2021 infrastructure bill for addressing impacts of water shortages, Western states have resources to invest in a variety of solutions. Advertisement  “There are so many things we can do beyond debating water allocations,” said Jennifer Pitt, director of the Audubon’s Colorado River Program. “This is climate change barging through the front door of the Colorado River Basin. It calls for all hands on deck. We cannot get by in the long run with a short-term solution stacked on top of a short-term solution. We need long-term resilience plans and systems thinking.”Just south of the US–Mexico border, a binational coalition of conservation groups called Raise the River is slowly rebuilding areas of critical natural habitat in the river’s former delta. In the last decade, the coalition has restored over 1,500 acres across several restoration sites with an amount of water that, Pitt said, amounts to less than 1% of the river’s annual flow. According to Audubon’s research, restored sites along the Colorado River delta have species populations that are 80% greater than those of lands not yet restored.At Laguna Grande, the largest of the sites, dragonflies dart across deep pools ringed by mesquite trees, and desert temperatures noticeably drop under the shade of cottonwoods. Here, it feels possible to imagine how alive the delta once was.Securing water for the project required building partnerships between the US and Mexican governments, creating a water trust, raising millions of dollars, and passing two treaty agreements. The treaties were the first of their kind in the basin to designate water specifically for nature and the river itself. Pitt pointed to the delta restoration project as an example of how collaboration can benefit people, animals, and the river. Advertisement  “Rather than being a scary, dangerous prospect to bring excluded parties to table, I think we are actually seeing more parties with a broader solution set willing to think creatively,” Pitt said.Planning focused on building resilience is increasingly supported by a number of groups. A recent report issued by the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, Environmental Defense Fund, and several other nonprofits identifies 10 strategies for policymakers to consider as they search for solutions for the Western water crisis. Ranging from the more theoretical, such as ways to slow snow melting, to the well established, such as technology that increases agricultural efficiency, the report proposes a broader approach to addressing water shortages.
 


Water is life“Our people were specifically put where we are along these rivers and streams…We are born from water,” said McDowell, explaining the Fort Mojave Indian Tribe’s historical connection to the Colorado River. “The Creator placed us here when he created us. The heartbreak is to see it being misused and seeing it over allocated. Because it is a living spirit.”The story of the Colorado River is thousands of years old, but we are still very much at the start of the next chapter of its existence — one in which the centrality of water to life, and its deep interconnections, will only grow clearer as scarcity intensifies. The changing climate will become an inescapable fact of life for everyone in the West.“We have to anticipate that future inflows will be less than [those of] the last 22 years,” said senior water and climate scientist Brad Udall, calling on policymakers to be realistic and develop future management plans based on data, which indicates a much drier future. “When I hear the phrase ‘new normal,’ I actually get a little frustrated. … What we are seeing is not anything related to normal. Normal implies predictability. This climate is not stationary; it is going to continue to change, and people need to plan for less water.” Advertisement  While progress has been made toward addressing current shortages, it remains to be seen whether long-term agreements on more fundamental changes can be reached in a basin accustomed to incremental policy adjustments — and whether political promises of cooperation and inclusion result in concrete actions.“Water gives us life,” McDowell said. “People need to start thinking about the impacts of our use of this river from a long-term perspective — not just about how much money this company or person is going to make. If we’re not careful in what we decide, we will cease to exist.”

With just a matter of days until the new year, if you exist in certain pockets of Twitter, you’ve likely seen an illustration of a Black woman stepping from one year into the next wearing high heels with a bag in hand.The illustration, created by British Ghanaian graphic artist Peniel Enchill, first appeared on the internet in 2014 and routinely goes viral each year. It has also become synonymous on Black Twitter with the saying “New year, new me.” Advertisement     In 2021, it went viral again in the middle of the year during the milk crate challenge when people thought a Black woman who completed the challenge in heels resembled the artwork.“I did that artwork in hours. It usually takes me a while to finish up an illustration. But I had what I like to call these days a ‘download,’ where you literally see the picture in your mind and it's just a matter of transferring that image from your mind to the paper. I rarely get that, but that was one of them,” Enchill told BuzzFeed News.The 29-year-old, who is based in Sheffield, England, recalled posting her artwork to her Instagram at a time that preceded the platform’s stories feature.“I remember logging back into Instagram and on my main feed, not on my profile, but on my main feed, I just kept swiping and seeing the image that I've drawn,” she said. “So these were actual reposts from people that I follow.” Advertisement     
 


The image was shared by larger platforms, including the Shade Room, and within hours, it was everywhere. Overnight, her audience on Instagram grew by 40,000. But as the popularity and reach of her artwork expanded, so did opinions, which were followed up with memes, reedits, and misogynistic trolling.“All I could see was the negative. Yes, there was positive feedback, but it was clouded by a lot of negative, and I took it quite personally,” she said.It took a word of advice from Enchill’s younger brother for her to see past the small pockets of negativity as her platform exploded, bringing new eyes to her entire portfolio.“My brother, being my brother, was like, 'Why are you upset? Have you seen how many followers you've got? Have you seen how many people have seen it? It's all over Twitter,’” she said. “I think it took me a whole day or two to start seeing the positive sides.”
 


Today, Enchill has over 270,000 followers on Instagram and can consistently chart a surge of growth around this time of year.Enchill said she is a big believer in how transformative a new year can be, and continues to create special illustrations to mark the end of one year and the start of another.Reflecting on her 2014 piece, she said that she was looking for a way to communicate that going into the new year is like stepping into a better year.“I think I'm still like that,” she said. “I still enter the year exactly like the girl that I drew. Reflecting on the year before, thinking about what I'm trying to achieve in the new year.”She said it’s still slightly hard to see her art used in a way that she wouldn't have approved of if she had been asked. Many of the memes of the woman were misogynistic and edited her going back to bad situations concerning relationships with men.She also said she has been approached about turning her artwork into NFTs (nonfungible tokens), but she is struggling to understand the benefit of it. “I don't think I've come to a comfortable place with that yet,” she said. “I might just have to do one to see how I feel about it all, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea yet.”
 


Black women are always central in Enchill’s art, often depicting them in storylines that deal with pushing back against cultural norms and unrealistic expectations demanded of them.“My focus is particularly on the Black community, with an extra focus of Black women and uplifting, inspiring, creating art for us, by us — speaking about issues that are not really spoken about, and celebrating things that affect us directly,” she said.She also owns a stationery brand that features her art, and hopes to one day see it stocked at major retailers.This year’s artwork is still in progress, she added, but the inspiration behind it is the well-known phrase “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” But that, of course, hasn’t stopped people from making their own.

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes. Advertisement  
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

More than 500 homes were destroyed and tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate after high winds whipped two wildfires in suburban areas near Boulder, Colorado, on Thursday.Both fires were likely started by downed power lines, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said, but officials are continuing to investigate. As of Thursday evening, only one injury had been reported — debris blew into a police officer's eye — but Pelle stressed the human toll could be higher. Advertisement     By Friday morning, however, there were still no reports of fatalities, he said, adding that a person who had been reported missing was accounted for and doing well.""So that's awesome news, and actually, I think given the events that we had yesterday, pretty miraculous,"" Pelle said during a news conference.Kelli Christensen, a spokesperson for UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, told BuzzFeed News the facility received six patients in connection with the fires. Christensen did not provide any information about their condition or injuries, citing privacy laws.The Middle Fork and Marshall fires started Thursday morning and exploded as wind gusts of more than 100 mph hit the region. As of Thursday evening, the Marshall fire had burned through 1,600 acres, prompting evacuations in Superior and Louisville, as well as parts of Broomfield. Videos on social media showed people leaving stores that shut down as smoke loomed. Advertisement     
 


All 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision outside the town of Superior were destroyed, as well as 210 homes in the Old Town neighborhood. A shopping center and hotel also burned, and authorities said the full scope of damage in other neighborhoods remained unknown.""I would estimate it's going to be at least 500 homes,"" Pelle said, but added that he would ""not be surprised if it's 1,000.""The fires burned over an area that includes approximately 2,000 homes, but some neighborhoods were left standing, while others were completely devastated, authorities said.
 


The National Weather Service Boulder extended a high-wind warning until 8 p.m. Thursday for locations at the base of the foothills, but winds weakened in the area of the fires overnight. Advertisement     ""We were fortunate that the winds dissipated last night,"" Pelle said.As snow began to fall over the Boulder area Friday morning, authorities said that as long as the weather holds up there shouldn't be much additional damage from the fires.
 


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he spoke with President Joe Biden on Friday and that the state has been approved for federal assistance. Still, he recognized that many things lost could not be replaced.“There’s no way to quantify in any financial way the price of a loss, the price of losing the chair that was handed down to you from your grandmother, of losing your childhood yearbooks, of losing your photos, of losing your computer files, which hundred of Colorado families have experienced today with no warning,"" Polis said.Footage from a Denver7 News reporter showed homes continued to burn Thursday night.
 


Weather disasters are inextricably linked to human-induced climate change. The planet has already warmed 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA, and that’s making disasters worse. Wildfire seasons are getting longer. Hurricanes are getting wetter and more dangerous. Heat waves are getting hotter, more frequent, and longer-lasting. Heavier rainfall across the US is triggering more inland flooding. And the cost of climate disasters is soaring. Stopping this vicious cycle will require drastically reducing our reliance on climate-polluting fossil fuels.According to the NWS Boulder, the second half of this year was one the driest on record for the Denver area.""Denver received well above normal precipitation from February through June. But since then, precipitation has flat-lined,"" the station tweeted.
 


Polis also acknowledged how unusual the timing was for a wildfire.“Here in December, who thought we would be fighting a major grassland fire?” he said.On Friday, after viewing the damage from above, Polis again spoke to the shock of watching the disaster materialize so rapidly at a time when the state and the country are grappling with yet another surge in the coronavirus. Advertisement     ""You know it feels like we’ve experienced enough tragedy and loss these last two years and then yesterday happened over the course of several hours,"" he said. ""This is our community and to watch it burn so quickly, so unexpectedly is something that I think we’re all just struggling to believe and understand.""

415,What’s the punishment for storming the Capitol? A BuzzFeed News analysis shows judges are struggling to figure it out.,"


The BBC has come under fire for airing a segment about the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict that featured commentary from a man who allegedly sexually assaulted one of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, while failing to disclose that fact to viewers.In a statement Thursday, the network said that the appearance of lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who also had represented Epstein, did not meet its editorial standards.""Mr. Dershowitz was not a suitable person to interview as an impartial analysis and we did not make the relevant background clear to our audience. We will look into how this happened,"" the statement reads. Advertisement     In 2015, Virginia Giuffre said in a federal lawsuit that Epstein kept her as a sex slave and forced her to have sex with Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. Both men have strongly denied the allegations.Giuffre was not called to testify in Maxwell's trial, though she was mentioned hundreds of times in court proceedings. She is currently suing Andrew in New York federal court for sexual abuse.After Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking charges on Wednesday, Dershowitz appeared on BBC World News, where he was introduced simply as a ""constitutional lawyer,"" to discuss Maxwell's conviction.
 


Dershowitz criticized Giuffre during the segment, saying that the prosecutors' choice not to involve her in their case against Maxwell discredited her accusations against him and Epstein.""The government did not use as a witness the woman who accused Prince Andrew, who accused me, accused many other people because the government didn't believe she was telling the truth,"" Dershowitz said.He also addressed the ongoing proceedings between Giuffre and Andrew. He said Maxwell's conviction ""weakens the case against Prince Andrew considerably because the government was very selective in who it used.""The network immediately came under fire for the segment.
 


Dershowitz issued a statement on Twitter on Thursday morning after the backlash against his interview with the BBC.""Following the Maxwell conviction, BBC requested an interview, during which I explicitly stated that I , Prince Andrew and other people had been accused of having sex with Virginia Guffre,"" he said. Advertisement     ""I commented on the prosecution’s wise decision not to use her as a witness because of her lack of credibility. The media has repeatedly interviewed victims of Epstein’s abuse,"" Dershowitz said in another tweet. He added that it was ""appropriate"" for the network to interview him and suggested that those accused of sexual assault by Giuffre were the ""victims.""

Here’s a cheerful holiday question, as we enter the third year of a once-a-century pandemic: What does it feel like to live through the world ending?This is — if you really, really zoom out — the question that occupies the aggregate Marvel Cinematic Universe. I’m not saying this is why everyone sees Marvel movies. Obviously not. They make money for the normal reasons of being entertaining, with some of the best and most charismatic actors in large-scale, interlocking adventure stories that occasionally elevate into greatness; they are without pretension and with the natural pull of superheroes (having a favorite). They are a good time. Advertisement  What I am saying, however, is that a real depth of the MCU derives, paradoxically, from a hollowness at its core: It's a series about the world ending via surreal external forces that never really deals with what it means for the world to end.I’ve been thinking about this for three reasons: a. The pandemic just won’t end, b. I have somehow seen six of the nine Marvel properties released in 2021, including Eternals, c. I happened to catch some of Iron Man recently.At the time of release, the original Iron Man was a true product of the George W. Bush years. In 2008, the film's sunshine wittiness and rejection of defense-contractor WMDs sat against the dominant superhero series of that era: Christopher Nolan's Batman. On some level, The Dark Knight, also released in 2008, concerns how far Americans should go to eradicate terrorism and what happens to those who do and why anyone would pursue that at all — a more realist (in presentation), more violent venture into the soul, where you might see a tattered American flag waving in the early morning sun. Rather than bleak, Iron Man is fun.Thirteen long, long years later, Iron Man — if you watch it right now — loses all that Bush-era context and gains a different one. If that exact movie were released today, given all that’s come since within the constructed MCU and in the unfolding trajectory of our real lives, you'd almost expect arch title cards at the beginning: “This was back before the aliens started invading and half the world's population disappeared for five years.” Back when things were messed up, back before they got REALLY messed up, possibly where it all began. It’s a much simpler, more contained movie, where the problems are entirely man-made and direct. Aliens don’t invade; people aren’t forced to kill each other or themselves to protect humanity; there isn’t even that much of a mysterious next property to set up yet. Advertisement  
 


Because Marvel has decided (so far) against completely rebooting existing properties under the Disney banner, the shows and films have begun to acknowledge how weird and extreme the last 10 years of the parallel Marvel world was.The latest Disney+ title, Hawkeye, opens with an 11-year-old girl — Kate Bishop (eventually Hailee Steinfeld) — watching aliens destroy her family’s penthouse and kill her father in 2012, i.e., a scene from the first Avengers movie, from a spectator’s perspective. These touches are usually more comic than anything: In that series’ present day, Hawkeye eyes “Thanos Was Right” graffiti, and catches a terrible musical rendition of the Avengers history. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Shaun (Simu Liu) walks past flyers advertising help coping with the blip: “POST-BLIP ANXIETY? YOU ARE NOT ALONE.” His college friend tells him, basically, it's time to grow up because you never know when half of humanity, including you, might disappear again. Advertisement  The more surface touches of this, though, weirdly, are reminiscent of the surface touches of the pandemic. The New York subways remain plastered, for instance, with an ad advising proper mask-wearing, featuring a consistent black-ink cartoon style against a rich gold-yellow backdrop. These cartoon characters started in summer 2020; they got winter clothes toward Christmas last year; they started reminding you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated in the spring; now they remind you to wear a mask, ask you to read or look at your phone instead of talking, and get a booster vaccine (""Need a boost?""). Staring at one while on your way to the dentist has that same sort of surrealist humdrum irony touch.
 


Nothing deals with the preceding decade of the MCU without really dealing with the decade more than Spider-Man: Far From Home. That movie opens with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) arguing about how not every catastrophe is aliens, the catastrophe apparently being aliens, then a segue into a meme-looking high school PA in memoriam of fallen Avengers set to “I Will Always Love You,” and a recap of people returning from the blip with a lament that people had to take midterms and a returned marching band member getting hit in the face with a basketball. Shortly thereafter, Spider-Man and a joking Aunt May do a Salvation Army fundraiser for everyone in New York displaced from their homes by their own disappearance. Now Far From Home rules (many Spider-Mans converge on Spider-Man in a trippy virtual reality), and arguably a jokiness fits both Spider-Man and the overall realm of high school, but it does not per se encompass all the emotions that might follow half the earth’s population atomizing temporarily. Advertisement  Elsewhere in Phase Four of the MCU, this occasionally goes deeper, if briefly, like the suggestion of Kate Bishop’s origin story. WandaVision features Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) waking up from the blip in a cancer ward to find her mother died a long time ago; the hospital is total chaos. Hawkeye opens one episode with Florence Pugh’s Yelena stepping into a powder room and seeing herself disappear and reemerge in the blip, with the walls changing color around her as time jumps ahead five years. When she exits, her old friend has a husband and a child. The overall effect in 2021 is: Oh damn, it’s like the pandemic.What they aren’t really doing is dealing too much with how everyone keeps living their lives — on any deeper, presumably more emotionally chaotic level — despite the actual mass death, destruction, and resurrection that the Marvel world puts forward. The story stays pretty contained to a few dozen heroes; absolution is usually not too hard to achieve; the next thing is always coming, and whatever it is, it will follow the rhythms of the first thing. We all know to expect the last 15 to 30 minutes of a Marvel enterprise to be consumed by a CGI fight in the air with aliens/robots/dragons/witches (so much so that Spider-Man: Far From Home’s villain operates on that expectation) intermingled with some forward-looking irresolution. Even with (fun!) characters like Kate Bishop, Marvel doesn’t really delve too deeply into how and why the collapsing earth resulted in a wealthy 22-year-old beating up mafia bros (beyond a dope opening credits sequence).WandaVision, for instance, tells a very specific, deep Twilight Zone story about how the mind can try to rewrite a brutal, shocking loss. But when the narrative ventures toward how that kind of grief — no matter how real — can inflict pain on other people, the show backs away from dealing with the implications of what Marvel’s heroes wrought, in favor of the next thing (promoting Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange). Which is, actually, mostly fine; not everything must be The Leftovers or Crime and Punishment, and WandaVision offered plenty of compelling cuts of a life undone. And Spider-Man: Far From Home is fun as hell and they shouldn’t have changed anything about it.
 


The more I’ve thought about this eternal setup at the expense of the current thing, though, it’s seemed to me almost like an accidental depth, one that speaks to the last decade, in which it’s occasionally felt like the world is ending — or at least becoming complicated beyond previous recognition. And I wouldn’t exactly say this fundamental feature of the MCU makes most of these titles excellent art on the individual level about what it feels like for the world to feel like it’s ending.But taken together, at the 100,000-foot level, the fact that each property is basically about someone doing what they were doing anyway, then having to deal with some new iteration of surreal but familiar external forces invading, and never having any time to really think about what it all means because the next thing is already happening, as it turns out — now that we really do live in a notable historical period of continual surreal events that could make you question the foundations of society — everyone has to continue doing what they were doing anyway when the world is ending, and you’ll never have that much time to think about what it all means because the demands of the next thing will be upon you.What does it feel like when the world ends? It just feels like aliens invading until something else happens. ●

[Note: This post — the sixth annual in a series! — is a list, not a ranking, so please don't yell at us if your favorite is #27 or whatever.]1. The Stuck Ship
 


On March 23, the container ship Ever Given was just makin’ its way downtown when strong winds wafted it off course, lodging it sideways in the Suez Canal. The vessel, bigger than the Empire State Building, blocked the global trade route for days, preventing billions of dollars of goods from reaching their destinations.So, yeah, global trade disaster, the economy, sure, it wasn’t great. But over on the Good Ship The Internet, people spiraled it into a huge and undeniably delightful meme on Twitter symbolizing all of life’s most daunting obstacles. Ever Given wiggled free nearly a week later (because of THE MOON!!!), but I, for one, support the stuck ship getting stuck again sometime.2. Sea Shanties
 


Speaking of nautical memes, sea shanties had a huge moment in early January, searing them into history as one of the first major memes of 2021. Scottish singer Nathan Evans posted a rendition of “The Wellerman” on TikTok in the last week of 2020. In the following weeks, it blew up with people duetting it, layering their own vocals and instrumentation until it turned into a gradually growing viral chorus.A number of other 19th-century maritime folk songs also became hugely viral after that. Their popularity might’ve had something to do with the timing; between a pandemic winter and a deadly insurrection, things were feeling pretty bleak. These simple, catchy earworms — and the creative camaraderie they sparked — were a wholesome reprieve.3. Cheugy
 


Chevron print. Mugs emblazoned with #girlboss (see #8) or “but first, coffee.” Posting a picture of your significant other on Instagram and captioning it “my forever wedding date😍.” These highly specific things, and many others, are what one might label as “cheugy.” The term (pronounced chew-ghee) entered the public consciousness in a TikTok on March 30, but the woman who posted it told the New York Times that she and her friends had been using it since she coined it in 2013 to describe the basic millennial aesthetic. Advertisement     Though the TikTok had gotten pretty big on its own, it was only after Yahoo and the New York Times published articles about it that “cheugy” blew up across social platforms and received tons of media coverage and freakouts by 30-somethings. In reality, the backlash far outweighed the prevalence of anyone actually using the term, but the culture was already primed for some millennial-versus–Gen Z warfare; in the preceding months, discourse had been percolating that zoomers had “canceled” skinny jeans and side parts. And while there had been a handful of anti–skinny jean TikToks that set it in motion, they were vastly outweighed by millennials’ anti–anti–skinny jeans/pro–side part TikToks (including a few in the form of musical parody, which, of course, is the most cheugy form of comedy). Basically, no one’s actually calling anyone cheugy, and in fact, calling someone cheugy would be pretty cheugy. (Except BuzzFeed, which is def cheugy.)4. Bernie Sanders’ Mittens
 


It’s hard to believe President Biden was inaugurated this year, but he was, which was also how we wound up with easily the biggest political meme of 2021. Outside the Capitol on Jan. 20, Sen. Sanders was photographed wearing an extremely practical parka and mittens while carrying a manila envelope in a look that can best be described as “Vermont dad popping out for a quick errand.” The image instantly became a massive meme, with people inserting the photo into various images like a sort of Where’s Waldo? puzzle. (This was, as returning readers of this series know, Bernie’s second year in a row making it into the annual meme compendium.) Advertisement     In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers days later, Sanders said he’d seen the memes, explaining he had just “sitting there, trying to keep warm.” He gave a shoutout to the second-grade teacher who handknit the mittens for him after he lost his bid for president in 2016.5. Noodle the Pug
 


Bones or no bones? This was the question that determined our days, and the answer came from Noodle, a 13-year-old pug who became one of TikTok’s biggest stars this year. Each morning, Noodle’s owner, Jonathan Graziano, hoists the senior dog out of bed to see if he’ll stand up. When he succeeds, it is declared a “Bones Day,” and when he instead slumps back into bed as if he has not a single bone in his body — you guessed it — that’s a “No Bones Day.” Graziano started posting these videos in August, but they began getting millions of views in October, and the concept of “Bones Days” became a pervasive part of the online lexicon. Like reading tea leaves, but with an adorably floppy pup.6. Couch Guy
 


Long-distance relationships can be tough, but they’re probably a lot tougher if half the internet bands together to accuse you of cheating on your girlfriend. That’s what happened to Robert McCoy in September after his girlfriend, Lauren Zarras, posted a TikTok of her surprising him at his college. Presumably, she thought viewers would find it heartwarming, but it backfired immensely. Comments poured in insisting McCoy’s demeanor “was not excited at all” and that they could “feel the awkward tension.”People speculated he was cheating with one of the other women on the couch. The couple denied anything was wrong. Zarras defended him in the comments, and McCoy (who by now was better known as “Couch Guy”) posted his own TikTok, saying, “don’t be a creep,” under which commenters accused him of gaslighting. Some people even broke the video down frame by frame to “prove” McCoy was disloyal and that the couple would soon split.Zarras and McCoy beat the odds and are still together — but even months later, her TikTok comments remain a mess; people are obsessively checking in to see if they’ve broken up and picking apart everything she posts to theorize on the state of their relationship. In an essay for Slate in December, McCoy said the ordeal was reminiscent of True Crime TikTok’s history of people going too far with their sleuthing, like what happened with the Gabby Petito case and how Sabrina Prater, a trans woman who posts dancing TikToks, was targeted by a baseless conspiracy theory that she was a serial killer.“There will inevitably be more Couch Guys or Praters in the future,” McCoy wrote. “When they appear on your For You page, I implore you to remember that they are people, not mysteries for you to solve.” Advertisement     7. Astronaut in the Ocean
 


🎶 Whatchu know about rollin’ down in the deep? 🎶 I apologize to everyone who spent all of 2021 on TikTok for getting this stuck in your head again. “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Australian rapper Masked Wolf came out in 2019 but went hugely viral this year until it felt like it was in almost every other TikTok. People got preeeetty sick of it. As part of the backlash, the song became a sort of rickroll, with people mashing it up into other songs. “Bro I felt nauseous for a second,” one person commented on a mashup of the song with Katy Perry’s “Roar.”8. Gatekeep, Gaslight, Girlboss
 


The mythical “girlboss” jumped the millennial pink shark before the year even began. Women founders of chic, statusy companies — including the Wing, Away, and Reformation — faced accusations of toxic and even racist workplaces and not living up to the progressive ethos so outwardly key to their brands. Girlbosses, it turned out, didn’t lead the revolution (and were, in fact, kinda cringe). Advertisement     Though the ironic usage of “girlboss” was already common by 2020 to highlight the emptiness of corporate feminism, this year gave us the ultimate catchphrase for aspiring she-EOs everywhere: “gatekeep, gaslight, girlboss.” The phrase first appeared on Tumblr in January, according to Know Your Meme, and quickly took internet culture by storm (particularly in TikTok comments). Another phrase, “girlbossed a bit too close to the sun,” also became a meme on TikTok. (Honorable mention goes to being “a woman in STEM.”9. The Backyardigans
 


The Backyardigans, a musical children’s show that aired on Nickelodeon from 2004 to 2013, had a major nostalgic resurgence on TikTok this spring, starting when TikToker Merlysha Pierre posted in April about the program’s numerous “supersonic bops.” Several of the show’s original songs, including “Into the Thick of It,” and “International Super Spy,” went viral, and “Castaways” became so popular it reached the top of Spotify’s global viral chart.The show’s voice actors, as well as lyricists and composers behind the music, told BuzzFeed News in June they were moved and amazed to see their work being celebrated so widely years later. Advertisement     “I’m still floored at how many years have gone by and people are making this a big thing, but I also understand, because I smile every time I think of The Backyardigans,” said Jamia Simone Nash, the singing voice behind Uniqua. “Being a part of everyone’s childhood, that’s been the best part of my career.”10. Kathryn Hahn Winking
 


WandaVision was one of the most popular TV shows of the year, so naturally, we got some memes out of it. Kathryn Hahn winking became basically the 2021 version of “sure, Jan,” and people got really creative with it.11. The Feminine Urge
 


2021 was all about embracing your femininity when it came to this meme. Starting in October, tweets about ones’ highly specific “feminine urges” — “to hunt and gather (steal),” “to hold your boob when you’re bored,” “to die for Harry Styles” — were everywhere on the site, and they quickly spread to Instagram and TikTok. Despite the chokehold it had across platforms, the meme actually originated months earlier on Tumblr (a common genesis with these kinds of text-based memes), according to Know Your Meme. Advertisement     12. “No Children” by the Mountain Goats
 


A 2002 indie-folk song about divorce may not scream viral TikTok challenge contender, but 2021 finds a way. The depressing tune started taking off on the platform in October and wound up spiraling into a whole dance trend (featuring a lot of cats).The Mountain Goats’ lead singer John Darnielle told Vox it felt odd to learn of the virality of “No Children,” but he’s happy to see a new generation enjoying the band’s music. “There is a certain joy in sort of feeling like, well, the kids have got a thing going on that I’m not going to fully get. But I can just enjoy watching,” he said. “I think people fear getting older and fear that they’ll feel left out, but there’s a kind of buoyancy in that left-out quality sometimes, if you ride it the right way.”13. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, and Oprah
 


Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s sitdown interview with Oprah Winfrey was undoubtedly one of the biggest TV events of 2021. The conversation was full of bombshells that left many stunned — including Winfrey herself, whose expression of shock wound up becoming a huge reaction meme on Twitter.14. Bama Rush
 


One wild week in August, people suddenly found their TikTok feeds flooded with blonde women in Shein statement earrings, Steve Madden wedges, and brightly colored skirts and dresses from somewhere called “Pants Store.” We’re talking, of course, about sorority rush at the University of Alabama, with other Southern schools hopping in on the trend soon after. Videos of the potential new members (PNMs) showing off their outfits before each recruitment round went viral, catapulting some of them to TikTok stardom faster than you can say “jewelry is normal.” #BamaRush became such a sensation that people posted their predictions guessing what sorority each PNM would get into, and some dressed up for parody TikToks sharing their own “oh oh tee dees.”15. Berries and Cream
 


If you spent any time on YouTube in the 2000s, you might remember this little lad and his love of berries and cream. The 2007 ad for Starburst was a viral hit at the time, but this summer, it had something of a renaissance and fully took over TikTok. You could hardly scroll through your feed without getting rickrolled by the jingle or seeing someone dancing the signature jig.The original “little lad,” performance artist Jack Ferver, even got in on the fun, starting their own TikTok account where they dress up and perform as the iconic character. “What I found interesting was writing back to people who were commenting, and really getting into that zone of performing the Little Lad,” Ferver told the New York Times. “It’s another performance art piece.”16. Here Comes the Boy
 


🎶 Here comes the boyyyy, hello boy, welcome, there he is, he is here… 🎶 This little ad-libbed jingle became one of TikTok’s most wholesome audio memes over the summer when user @june_banoon posted a video singing it to a neighbor’s cat (named Johnny, but who goes by the excellent nickname “Mashed Potatoes”). Advertisement     Naturally, everyone loved it, and a ton of people made duets, accompanying it on pianos, guitars, violins, flutes, harps, and trumpets and layering on their own vocal harmonies until it was transformed into a gorgeous, cumulative symphony.17. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy?
 


And now, clinching the elusive 2021 title of horniest meme of the year! “Mommy. Sorry? Mommy,” first originated in August, when TikTok user @roofjesus said it in a thirsty post about their girlfriend. The audio blew up, especially among queer women on the platform.But the place the phrase became most ubiquitous was in comment sections; scroll through the comments on any thirst-trappy TikTok and you’re bound to find it. Some have criticized the trend, saying the comments sexualize people who didn’t ask to be.18. People Kildren
 


This kicked off in a TikTok by @lawrinkydink from May where he attempts to sing the Black Eyed Peas’ classic “Where Is the Love?” and gets the lyrics totally wrong, making up words while attempting to remember them. His version goes “children peekle, people kildren.” Inspired by the commitment to continue even when clueless, people started making their own videos to it. Like in this one, a TikTok user counts how many times he uses the same wrong words in the video. In another, someone wrote out the entire lyrics and that eventually led to a really soothing cover.19. Bean Dad
 


There’s an old adage that every day there is a main character of Twitter, and “the goal is to never be it.” That goal was promptly fumbled by podcaster John Roderick, or as you more likely know him, “Bean Dad,” who on Jan. 2 tweeted a thread about how, as a “teaching moment,” he made his 9-year-old daughter spend hours trying to figure out how to open a can of beans rather than just open it for her himself.What transpired was a backlash so fierce that “milkshake ducking” could ostensibly be renamed “bean dadding.” People piled on Roderick, criticizing his parenting and accusing him of child abuse (he later said a few even reported him to Child Protective Services). Roderick deleted his account after offensive tweets he’d posted years prior were resurfaced, and he wound up apologizing (both for those tweets, as well as the thread) in a lengthy blog post. Advertisement     20. White Girl Dancing
 


Whilst the observation that white girls dance just slightly offbeat with their hands in the air has been long noted by historians, this year it really took off as a meme. Videos of people dancing with their hands in the air, typically to the Calvin Harris song “How Deep Is Your Love,” became a meme in early summer this year. Black people on TikTok then started lifting their White Claws in the air to do the dance too. One Black TikToker told Mashable he found the white girl dance to be “freeing.”21. Two Guys on the Bus
 


The meme of the two people on opposite sides of a bus, where one of the passengers gets a view and the other does not, really took off in mid-November. The way it works in meme form is by associating something negative with the sad-faced passenger looking out at the hill and something positive with the lucky fellow looking out at the view. According to Know Your Meme, the meme was first used by Brazilian Twitter users and then it made its way to Reddit and eventually back to the English-speaking side of Twitter. Now lots of people have filled in their own texts, such as sad boy’s “people remembering their childhoods” sitting across from smiling “their moms being like ‘that’s not how I remember it’” guy. Advertisement     22. Naur
 


“Naur” is a play on how Australians pronounce the word “no” with stan Twitter really turning it into a ~cool~ way of disagreeing with something. It also became popular through the TikTok meme based on the Australian TV show H2O where people would remake a scene and say “Oh naur Cleo.” For those of you who know about the speaking in italics meme, “naur” is pronounced like the italic version of “no.” Or, if you’re Aussie, it’s just pronounced correctly.BuzzFeed News senior culture writer (and noted Australian) Estelle Tang explained in her story that “naur”’ took off after a viral TikTok where someone screamed it and the comments of that video ended up filled only with the word. People didn’t only say “naur” with the Aussie twang; they also started making memes about its pronunciation, such as this Normani tweet that has us wheezing into our Vegemite toast. Advertisement     23. The Omarion Variant
 


The announcement of the Omicron variant of coronavirus was met with the same exhausted but frenzied energy as Delta: memes. However, this time, thanks to the variant’s name’s similarity to that of the musician and former lead singer of B2K, the meme potential was even wilder. The internet renamed it “the Omarion variant,” posting videos and photos of the Californian singer (he even joined in himself on the tweets). Omarion dancing in the music video for the song aptly named “Touch” was the perfect meme, as was this one riffing off the lyrics from his song “Post to Be.” This moment made the “my plans vs. the Delta variant” tweets feel like a lifetime ago.24. Immortal Snail
 


Imagine this: You are offered millions of dollars and the chance to become immortal. The catch? A giant snail — whose mere touch will kill you instantly — also becomes immortal and will hunt you down for eternity. This hypothetical scenario originated in 2014 on the podcast Rooster Teeth but resurfaced in August in a TikTok from @benjhandy. By October, the immortal snail had became a meme in its own right, with tons of people making TikToks about it (usually paired with John Lennon’s “Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” for inexplicable reasons) depicting their eternal hell evading the slimy menace’s slow but unrelenting pursuit.25. Waking Up in the Morning
 


🎶Waking up in the morning, thinking about so many things…🎶 Easily one of the biggest musical memes of the year, this song could most often be found in TikToks of people revealing their most embarrassing moments. It comes from a 2011 episode of Real Housewives of New Jersey, during which a then–10-year-old Gia Giudice performed an emotional rendition of her made-up song in an effort to convince her mom and uncle to stop fighting. Advertisement     The now–20-year-old took her belated viral fame in stride, posting her own TikTok in March lip-synching to it. In an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, Giudice said she never imagined her song would blow up a decade later, “but honestly, I think it’s so funny and I’m just owning it at this point.”26. Yassification
 


If you’ve seen Lin-Manuel Miranda with a full contour, the Quaker Oats guy with platinum blonde hair extensions, or all four members of Weezer with lip fillers and a smoky eye, you probably already know this one. One of the biggest LGBTQ memes of the year, “yassification” consisted of editing images of famous figures in FaceApp to transform them into the Instagram Face version of themselves. The word “yassification” (derived from “yaaas queen,” the term that originated with queer people of color in 1980s ball culture but went mainstream in the mid-2010s thanks to Broad City and a Lady Gaga fan’s video) first appeared on Twitter in 2020, according to Know Your Meme, but it wasn’t until this November that it fully took off. “Yassified” images started bubbling up all over Twitter and TikTok, particularly on the account @YassifyBot. Denver Adams, the 22-year-old art student behind the account, told BuzzFeed News in November that they hope their creations make people consider how apps like FaceApp can contribute to unhealthy beauty standards.“The bottom line is it’s a satire of this ageist technology and insane beauty standards through these artificial intelligence apps,” Adams said.27. Gorgeous Gorgeous Girls
 


Hot girl summer may have come and gone, but 2021 was all about being a gorgeous, gorgeous girl. The phrase comes from an August TikTok, in which user @fishdress professed that “gorgeous, gorgeous girls love soup.” It went massively viral, and tons of people posted their own versions, with the expression becoming ubiquitous on Twitter as well.The markers of a gorgeous, gorgeous girl vary widely, but may include loving pickles, taking the train because they can’t drive, listening to Simple Plan, having stomach problems, adopting pit bulls, getting their booster shot, and pretending “to be Beth March dying of scarlet fever every time they’re near the sea.” Really, anyone can be a gorgeous, gorgeous girl if they decide they are one.28. Milk Crate Challenge
 


This is a challenge that probably shouldn’t have taken off the way it did. The Milk Crate Challenge involved stacking crates into a pyramid and scaling it — often to disastrous results. Doctors advised against it, with some telling the Washington Post they had treated patients who’d taken part. Advertisement     People would film themselves walking up the crates like stairs, but because of the lack of stability, many wound up brutally wiping out. Even so, people continued to attempt the challenge, and one woman even completed it in high heels.The internet did its bit to warn people of the danger, with the best meme PSA being, of course, the edit of “Jason Derulo” tumbling down the crates.29. I Know It Ain’t the Stallion
 


This meme comes from none other than the queen Keke Palmer, who was the red carpet presenter for Vogue at this year’s Met Gala. When Megan Thee Stallion walked up, she said, “Oh oh oh, I know it ain’t… I know it ain’t the staaallion… You know it's your girl!” and the rest was history.That audio really took off on TikTok when a user remixed it with a keyboard. The sound went viral, and users made their own versions in the same format. For example, “I know it ain’t the consequences of my actions,” which JoJo Siwa used. Advertisement     Palmer later addressed the meme in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. “Why am I at my job doing that?” she said. “I don’t know what it is with me.”30. Red Flags
 


The red flag meme is one of the few memes from this year that will definitely make it long term: It’s short, simple, and memorable. First started on Black Twitter with people naming obvious negative traits someone could have, it quickly escalated from actual red flags about a person to just straight-up jokes. Obviously brand accounts jumped on it like they would any good meme, with MTV getting ratioed hard for their own red flag attempt.31. The Girls That Get It, Get It
 


This came from a TikTok user by the name of @khaenotbae from a video she posted in November. In a comment underneath, she explained she was mimicking Flavor of Love’s Tiffany Pollard. Advertisement     People have used the sound in TikToks about little inside jokes or life hacks they swear by, such as tips for makeup or filming TikToks. Though her audio went viral, TikTok somehow removed her original video but the sound remained up.As the trend went on, some people started to use it for things that are either too basic or ridiculous, which has led to people criticizing the meme.In case the voice sounds familiar to you, the TikTok user responsible for this sound is also the mastermind behind: “And by the way, I have a question and don’t fight me because I know how you girls like to tussle.”32. Good Soup
 


“Good soup,” a meme for when the soup is good (shoutout to my gorgeous, gorgeous girls). The simple audio clip comes from one of the final episodes of Girls, in which Adam Driver and Lena Dunham decide to part ways. Punctuating the emotional conversation held in a diner booth, Driver eats a spoonful of soup, throws up the “OK” hand sign, and says “good soup.” Though the episode aired in 2017, it wasn’t until August that it made its way to TikTok, and it quickly became a huge meme used to all sorts of wacky ends.In an interview with Screenrant, Driver said he was aware of the meme but didn’t really get it. “I mean, like I understand what memes are, I guess, but it’s not something I keep track of or am tracking,” he said.No worries, Adam, that’s what we’re here for.

2021 was a mix of ups and downs: leaving the house and then staying inside again, vaccines and variants. The year took a lot from us, as the pandemic continued and the number of people who died from COVID in the US alone surpassed 800,000 in December. Among those who have died in the past 12 months were some well-known figures, including Virgil Abloh and Michael K. Williams.Here's a look back at just a few of those in the public eye who died this year.

420,"“Lord, please free my people from the hold of this illustration.”","


This is a plain language version of a story published earlier this year, adapted by Sandy Mislow of the Self-Advocacy Association of New York State.
 


BuzzFeed News did an investigation into guardianships. The reporters learned that guardianships have hurt many people with disabilities. Here are eight important facts that were found during the investigation.
 


1. America’s guardianship system is supposed to help protect people with disabilities who are unable to make decisions for themselves. However, more than 1 million adults are now under guardianship and are at risk of abuse, theft, and even death. Advertisement     
 


2. People under guardianship can permanently lose their right to vote, marry, start a family, decide where to live, agree to medical treatment, spend their money, look for jobs, or own property. They can also lose the right to hire a lawyer to fight for them, which means that once a guardianship is in place, it is often impossible to find freedom again.
 


3. Sometimes guardians are family members, but they can also be professionals with hundreds of people under their control.
 


4. The guardianship system is not always fair to people with disabilities. The guardians, lawyers, and experts may be paid with money belonging to the person with disabilities, even if that person doesn’t want a legal guardian. Also, the judges and lawyers often know each other and may not make fair decisions about the person with disabilities.
 


5. Guardians who follow the rules can be very helpful for people with disabilities. But some people under guardianship have been abused, neglected, and killed. Others have been locked up and kept away from their families and friends.
 


6. Some guardians take all the money from people’s bank accounts. Last year a guardian was charged with abuse and neglect of a person under her protection. Another person under guardianship was abused by his home care staff and died, and his guardian did not realize he was missing for several months after it happened. Advertisement     
 


7. There are no laws in the U.S. about guardianship, and there is no way to know exactly how many people are affected by it. BuzzFeed News believes that there could be 200,000 new guardianship cases in our country every year.
 


8. Judges are not supposed to put someone under guardianship without first thinking about other options, but sometimes that doesn’t happen. Young people with disabilities are often put under guardianship after graduating from school. The National Council on Disability calls this the “school-to-guardianship pipeline.” Sometimes parents do not understand how bad guardianship can be until it is too late to change it.

The month before your 30th birthday has been an unrelenting onslaught of bad news. You try to keep your chin up because you love your birthday — you’re an Aquarius, but also a narcissist above all, so this should be your time. Instead, you feel like you’re pressing your forehead against very cold glass, waiting for it to shatter and cut you up into a million little pieces.You’re into your second year of quarantine thanks to a pandemic that you once dismissed as “just a bad flu.” Every day you take your stupid little depression walk with your stupid little mask, and you think about your stupid little brain and how, for a fleeting moment, it convinced you that this would be nothing. You haven’t seen your family or most of your friends since early 2020; you, a genius, opted to move to New York from Toronto a year before the pandemic hit, and now you feel trapped in a place that looks like home but feels completely foreign. When you google grocery stores (you don’t recognize any of the chains) to try to find bucatini, you just find a bodega that sells nothing but 6-year-old lime chips. Your niece calls you and tells you she’s been watching news clips of you online because she misses seeing your face and hearing your voice. You have never been punched in the nose with a closed fist (surprising, since you’ve often deserved it), but this is probably what it feels like. Advertisement  Every weekend, you sit in a transparent bubble built out of plastic and zippers, encircling a little patio table and chair and heater. Your ankles are on fire, your head is freezing cold. You’re too chilly — in every meaning of the word — to ever really enjoy the pleasure of getting drunk. You bring a Corpse Reviver No. 2 to your lips, shivering, and think, Yes, this is fine.Three weeks before your birthday, your Veena Masi dies in India, a country that once told you that you belonged there and then denied you a visa for entry, right before the pandemic hit. People tell you that the canceled trip was good news — “Imagine being stuck in India for all this!” It’s cold comfort — you’re sure you were denied because of an article you wrote a year earlier, critical of the Indian government and its handling of Kashmir, but you can’t even get any confirmation of this. Your aunt was a small, spry woman who spoke very little English but always held your hands in hers and told you that you look like your mother. She was a year younger than your mom, who calls you from Canada wailing into the phone. Her family is shrinking. She didn’t see this one coming. You want to run to her and make her chai and help manage your father, but you can’t, because there’s a pandemic, and accidentally killing your mother seems worse than just letting her suffer in front of you on FaceTime. “My childhood is gone,” she says. You’re quiet, and you listen, distinctly aware that your mother’s unbearable grief is but a reminder that your childhood, too, is slipping away.Your niece’s dog, Steven “Steve” Roger Koul, a miniature dachshund your brother got when you were in the 11th grade, is starting to slow down. He isn’t eating, he seems disoriented, and his face is mostly gray. Most of his teeth have been pulled, so now he peers around the room with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. It’s cute, but still a harbinger of doom. He’s an old man, but you’re hoping he can get through the year. You think about how you once took care of him for three weeks, and he kept leaping up on the kitchen counter to eat your lunches, day after day. You cry, because now he can’t really eat any sandwiches at all.Despite opening your laptop every day for 10 to 13 hours, you have made less than no progress on your book. You sold it a year before the pandemic compressed your life, a collection of essays about...what was it again? Fighting? Fights? Being an asshole? All three, maybe. But you have lost any sense of who you are, and such a thing makes writing about yourself impossible. When you read the thoughts of your own narrator, you think to yourself, God, I hate this woman. You wonder if you should give the money back to your publisher, or perhaps try to say something so inflammatory that they just cancel it themselves. (Written in your notebook during a brainstorm: “Do a murder? Be racist against an invented ethnic group? Try to get on Red Scare?”) Advertisement  You get a haircut because you want to feel better. It comes out looking like Steve chewed on your hair and left you with jagged ends. You call your friend Barb, who looks at you with her saddest eyes because she knows it’s beyond repair — that’s how you really know things are falling apart. You cry for three days while your husband, typically bold and confident, stands awkwardly at your bedroom door, looking at you, stricken. “But I like bangs,” he says, mostly to himself.
 


Steve has to be put down two weeks after Veena Masi’s death. Your niece is handling it better than any of the adults; she calls wearing a tiger onesie and plies you with platitudes. “He was old, Boo,” she says. “It was his time.” (She is still little enough to call you Boo — will that eventually change too?) She asks if you can still play video games together, a small reassurance that she’s malleable enough to not be forever embittered by this random, cruel moment in her life. Does everything really need to be taken away from this little girl, all at the same time? She’s in remote learning again, like children everywhere, and she hates it. She can’t even hug her grandparents, something she understands, but they somehow do not, despite being 60 years older than her. “Just one hug,” your dad tells her when she visits, outside, masked, many feet apart. “I’ll put a blanket on you and then hug you.” Advertisement  Your niece becomes incensed by your father’s disregard for the rules. “Don’t you get it?” she screams at him, her pink little face becoming red. “I could kill you!”Your mom’s older sister gets COVID, so she calls to talk about that, instead of the knee replacement she desperately needs. She texts you the crying-laughing emoji instead of the crying emoji, which for once, you can’t bring yourself to find very funny.What is a little funny is that turning 30 marks the end of other people thinking you’re exceptional. When you’re young and competent, people treat you like you’re some kind of wunderkind. It’s impressive that you can do your job, that you’re climbing out of debt, that you’re forming healthy relationships. But by the time you’re 30, you’re just doing what’s expected of you. It’s mundane, your semi-tidy apartment, your shelfful of books that visitors expect you to have actually read. That seems unfair. You realize that the next few years will be spent accepting that you’re no longer young enough to be considered interesting or compelling, and not old enough to have institutional power or an advanced sense of self-confidence. No one praises you for owning an iron anymore. Who will care about your average book at your average age?Your bangs continue to grow out, by which you mean horizontally. You look like a My Chemical Romance fan club president. You would like to die, but instead, you have to be grateful to not have the coronavirus, to have most of your family intact, to be healthy, to be alive. It’s a stupid fucking list — what kind of life is it to just have to be thankful for not losing it all the time? You grind your teeth so hard that the back of your front tooth chips. Instead of getting it fixed, you spend days rubbing your tongue against it until it bleeds. Advertisement  You post a photo of your bad haircut on Instagram in an attempt to make fun of yourself, the only way you know how to cope with a mild irritant. You end up hurting your own feelings when a stranger messages you, “I love mullets on brown women!” You delete the photo and write “FUCK” in a journal for seven pages.
 


So wrapped up in your own grief about the pandemic — and the idea of turning 30, which you have decided will remain just an idea, because you are not interested in actually turning 30 — you’re only startled back into being a person when your husband’s uncle and cousin die in quick succession. He spends hours on the phone with a family he can’t touch, all the cousins who look like shades of him. While he coughs through a tear, you angrily gaze at the small Hindu shrine you’ve built on your bookshelf. You’re not religious, but this year has made you desperate so you’ve taken to periodically lighting a candle at the feet of deities while offering various deals: If you don’t kill anyone, you can force me to keep this bad haircut indefinitely. If you make sure no one in my family gets hurt before we can see them again, you can put me in a little bit of debt. Not like Erika Jayne debt, though. Little debt. Cute debt. Debt I can joke about later.When your husband sleeps, you march up to the five of them. “I thought we had a deal? I thought lighting some nag champa and considering not eating meat on Tuesdays was the price??” They say nothing. You wonder if maybe you should join a cult instead. Advertisement  Your husband’s niece comes down with COVID, a result of still having to go to work through this collective year of agony. He frets about her quietly, how far she is from home too, how no one is there to take care of her. She’s in college, she should be out having fun. Like everything, this doesn’t feel fair either.The next week, you get your first American tax bill: an absolute assault of $10,000. You can pay it, but barely, in a way that brings your bank balance so low it makes you nauseous to look at your banking app. That same week, your husband’s niece and your aunt both recover within weeks of their first symptoms. You feel Lakshmi’s eyes on your back, her face cast in porcelain. You ask; I deliver.
 


Since the pandemic has halted largely everything about your life — except, allegedly, the passing of time — the biggest bash you can throw for your birthday is to drive upstate with your husband to a little house you’ve rented for a long weekend. It’s a brick cabin in a gated community, enshrined in ice after a few storms, which makes leaving the house a treacherous journey. The owner is a criminologist and former antiques dealer, giving the home a distinct “someone was murdered here” feel. The living room smells like mothballs and overflows with more rusty telescopes than you ever knew existed. One bookshelf is dedicated entirely to fragments of seashells. The kitchen is chaos; there’s a whole shelf just for gold-rimmed goblets, two AGA stoves that never turn off and rest at a fixed but indeterminate temperature, which makes cooking a bit of a magic trick. On the wall is an 1880s-era phone that doesn’t work, probably because the house doesn’t need you calling for help while the walls bleed and the home’s aura turns you inside out. It is a good place to contemplate your mortality. Advertisement  You tug on the cord leading to the attic and find two twin beds and a pile of furs. There are cabinets and closets with thick, impenetrable locks on them. This should be...fine.But who cares? This trip is for naught, because you’re not really turning 30. To turn 30 would suggest that the year you’ve spent in quarantine counted at all. It would suggest that time has been moving on as normal, which it clearly has not, evidenced by the fact that your body has not left your neighborhood in months. You entered the pandemic at the very beginning of your 29th year, so it’s impossible that you could be leaving it at 30 — or maybe even 31.You were raised in a family that required you to call every evening and use your vacation days to come home and visit. You’ve been calling, sure, but the conversations blend together, and there’s never any news, never any new stories to tell. You’re just happy your parents are alive and faking cheerfulness for your sake. No news, no progress, no time gone. So this isn’t really your 30th. You still have time to make it on a “30 Under 30” list, because this year doesn’t count.The day before your birthday, you rush to your husband excitedly with a plan. “Let’s do drugs tomorrow,” you say, hopping lightly on your toes while he toils away in the kitchen with the impossible stove that’s always on. He’s making cassoulet, the way your favorite restaurant in Toronto makes it. For days already, he’s been slow-cooking duck, simmering ragù, toasting bread crumbs, and braising sausage. “Do you really want to trip on your birthday?” he asks. Who knows. You mostly wanted to finish a book. But this is what young people do, and you are still young, because you are not yet 30. Advertisement  “We can,” your husband says, stirring the beans that have already been cooking for 16 hours. “But I made this big meal, and I want you to be able to enjoy it.” He looks at you worried and wounded that you’re tamping down your generally robust appetite. “You’re right,” you tell him with a quick kiss on the cheek, and let him go back to his beans. You spend some time in the attic excitedly looking for a body. You can only fight who you are for so long.
 


The morning of your birthday, you wake up and your husband presents you with videos from everyone you know and love, wishing you happy birthday from their little corners of the world, all huddled away from one another in case of death. He gets you an upsettingly overpriced hair dryer. You’re 30. It feels fine. When you post a photo of yourself on Instagram announcing your acceptance of this age, you’re feted with compliments about how “you look so much younger!” or “I thought you were older, you’re so accomplished!” Both are satisfying in different ways, and you bask like a pig in shit. Advertisement  Some of your best friends have scheduled a Zoom call for the afternoon. They’re your friends, but the closeness you feel with them even after exactly a year apart makes it feel like there should be a better word for them, one that contextualizes how they kept you alive during the nadir of your persistent depression.You chat with them for hours while draining a bottle of wine. Soon, you get sleepy and try to wind it down — everyone has virtual meeting fatigue, and you don’t want to make it worse for the faces you see in these little floating cubes, people who are similarly stuck in an emotional tundra, waiting for some kind of release. But suddenly, your friends all go on mute and start dropping off from the call, one by one. Then only Seb is left, and he peers at you while chewing on his nails. “I’ll send you a new link,” he says, disappearing himself.When you click on the new link, you’re transported to the University of Minnesota’s official Zoom account. A mistake? A prank, maybe? None of your friends are foolish enough to make such an error, and none of them are cruel enough to throw you into a first-year econ class on your birthday. But now you can make out the university’s Raptor Center. More importantly, you can see an owl called Ricky, who has rickets, who has been hired for your birthday to eat a mouse whole. Ricky gives you a little hoot and murders a mouse with three bites. It is horrific. You have never been so happy in your life. Imagine being so lucky that your friends — these people you met a decade ago, or even longer — know exactly what you want, which is to watch an owl choke down a mouse in your honor.The cassoulet is perfect. You have three servings. You and your husband sleep wrapped up together, like two trees that learned to grow around each other. Maybe it’s love, maybe you’re worried something is going to crawl out of the attic and kill you. Who cares. It’s a good feeling. Advertisement  Months later, when the ice melts, your friend Jenna holds your hand across a table at dinner in Bushwick and weeps about 30 being just around the corner for her. There were so many things she wanted to do before this birthday, so much taken from her in the last year and a half as well. She dabs at her impeccable eyeliner, stopping the bleed from running down her cheeks. “It’ll be OK,” you tell her, squeezing her hand in yours. “It’s just a birthday. How bad could it be?”Your niece gets a new dog, a little puppy she has named Beans. For years, you’ve been calling your niece Bean, and so now they are Bean and Beans, two little rats you love very much. Steve lives on in Beans’ shrieky bark and Bean’s unbridled happiness.You send a few pages of your book to your editor, finally, a year after she first emailed you waiting for a manuscript. “You’re right, they’re disjointed and stream of consciousness,” she tells you. “But there’s something there.” Are you relieved? Maybe — quitting altogether would’ve been nice, too.“I think the problem is you’re still writing like you did before the pandemic. And it’s not working because you’re not that person anymore. And I don’t know if you like the person you’ve become. How are you supposed to write about someone you don’t like?” You pull on the stack of new grey hairs you have sprouting from your temple.“For what it’s worth,” she finishes, “I like who you became. I think she’s great.” It’s been years since you’ve liked yourself, even longer since you’ve been able to verbalize it, but you did once, and maybe you can again. That afternoon, you sit with who you are now, and you get back to work. ● Advertisement

When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

Join HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering US politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.
 


WASHINGTON — What is the punishment for someone who admits they joined in on an attack on democracy?For Jordan Stotts of Minnesota, it was two years on probation, with two months of tighter limits on when he can leave home. He scaled a wall to join the breach of the US Capitol, was captured on camera shouting at officers in the rotunda, and vowed to return, posting on Facebook: “Patriots! I got kicked out but I’ll be back!”For Lori and Thomas Vinson of Kentucky, it was five years on probation plus a $5,000 fine. Prosecutors had wanted jail time for Lori — she told an interviewer after she was fired from her job for participating in the riot, “I would do it again tomorrow” — but a judge didn’t agree.For Boyd Camper of Montana, it was two months in jail. As he joined the mob streaming into the building, he filmed his trek on a GoPro. He told a news crew outside later, “We’re going to take this damn place.”The task of fashioning justice for people who admitted to participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection has fallen to 22 judges on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court’s members — a mix of Democrat and Republican appointees — have made clear they believe the assault on the Capitol was serious and violent, and that people convicted of crimes deserve punishment. They just don’t agree on what it should be.Some judges have bristled that prosecutors struck plea deals for low-level misdemeanors that limit the sentences they can impose. Some have imposed sentences that were harsher than the government’s recommendation; others have been more lenient. Some have questioned the varying sentences proposed by prosecutors across a spectrum of Capitol rioters who pleaded guilty to the same offense. Advertisement  It is “no wonder,” US District Chief Judge Beryl Howell said at an October sentencing, that some people “are confused about whether what happened on Jan. 6 was a petty offense of trespassing or shocking criminal conduct that represented a grave threat to our democratic norms.”Judges have had no patience for Donald Trump supporters trying to use the courthouse as a forum to relitigate President Joe Biden’s win in 2020. But the lack of consensus on the bench about what exactly justice should look like for each person who joined the mob mirrors a lack of consensus nationwide about how to think about the insurrection and its aftermath.The most common sentence has been probation, with a short period of home confinement or a fine mixed in, according to BuzzFeed News’ tracking of every prosecution filed in the year since the Jan. 6 attack. Probation means people can mostly return to their normal lives, with conditions — they have to regularly report to a probation officer, get permission to travel, submit to a home inspection at any time, and hold a job. They can’t have guns or other weapons. Violating probation by committing new crimes or failing to comply with other terms is a standalone crime that can be prosecuted.Nearly all of the 71 defendants sentenced as of the end of December pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, with most deals featuring the same charge: illegally parading in the Capitol, which carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Advertisement  In more than half of these misdemeanor sentencings, judges ordered punishments that were lighter than what the government argued for in terms of jail or home detention. Two-thirds of defendants sentenced for misdemeanor pleas didn’t receive any jail time.If you have more information about Jan. 6 or the legal fights in its aftermath, contact this reporter at zoe.tillman@buzzfeed.com, or see other ways to send tips here.Prosecutors have not charged everyone accused of descending on the Capitol with felonies that reflect the political nature of the overarching criminal event, which temporarily halted Congress’ certification of the election and the peaceful transfer of power. No one has been charged with sedition or insurrection, both rarely brought offenses. A top Justice Department official said early on that sedition was being explored for “the most heinous acts,” along with conspiracy; more than 50 people have been charged with that latter crime.Of the 700-plus people charged so far, BuzzFeed News’ analysis shows that just over half are facing at least one felony. The most common felony count is for obstructing an official proceeding; those cases have tended to involve some specific evidence that defendants were actively trying to disrupt the special session of Congress, such as making it to the floor of the Senate or expressing their intent in interviews or online. The obstruction offense has a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, although nonviolent, first-time offenders are likely to face far less than that, and prosecutors have already agreed to let some defendants plead down to a misdemeanor. There are also felony cases pending against people charged with assaulting police, carrying or using weapons, and civil disorder.Everyone else is being hit solely with misdemeanor charges for illegally being in the Capitol, disorderly conduct, and parading, a collection of counts carrying maximum penalties between six months to a year in jail. The US attorney’s office in Washington focused plea offers this year on the less serious cases with lower stakes. It’s a strategy that not only clears cases and frees up resources, but also is in keeping with broader trends across the US justice system, where the overwhelming majority of criminal cases end in plea bargains. Advertisement  This process means that justice for an attack on democracy is filtering through a criminal justice system largely built around agreements that are hammered out in secret between the accused (the rioters) and the accusers (the prosecutors), and sentences crafted by a single judge. The riot was the violent culmination of a monthslong effort led by Trump and his supporters to undo millions of votes cast in a presidential election, but there’s little to no opportunity for public input on the consequences for people who participated.
 


Judges have talked from the bench about the challenge of applying the normal rules to an unprecedented event like Jan. 6. They’ve explained that they have to treat each defendant as an individual and can’t punish them for the full spectrum of criminal activity committed at the Capitol. Advertisement  With most defendants admitting to the same misdemeanors on paper, judges are picking apart the details of their words and actions as compared to other rioters. They’re weighing how those details make a person more or less individually responsible for the threat — potential or actualized — posed by the mob.How many minutes did a defendant spend in the Capitol? Did they walk through a breached door or climb through a broken window? Where did they go? How far inside did they travel? Did they capture photos or video? Did they take selfies, and did they look happy to be there? Did they witness violence or vandalism and keep going? Did they publicly brag about it online, or only send messages to friends and family, and does that distinction matter? Is the remorse they expressed later legitimate or are they just sorry they got caught, and, really, how can anyone know for sure?And the big question that’s loomed over the conclusion of each of these cases: Is there any sentence that could dissuade people from storming the Capitol in January 2025 if they disagree with the results of the next presidential election?For some judges, the obvious answer is jail. In the handful of cases where a defendant has pleaded guilty to a felony like assaulting police or obstructing Congress, judges have imposed months or years of prison. The length of incarceration in misdemeanor cases may be short by comparison, but judges have said they hope the threat of any loss of liberty scares off other people, disappointed or furious when the candidate they supported loses an election, from taking matters into their own hands.US District Judge Tanya Chutkan has emerged as an early proponent of time behind bars for misdemeanor offenders. At a sentencing in early October, she ordered Matthew Mazzocco of Texas to spend 45 days in jail, becoming the first judge to go above the amount of time the government recommended. She chastised Mazzocco for treating the riot like “entertainment” — he’d posted a celebratory selfie in front of the Capitol on Facebook with the caption, “The capital is ours!” and took photos of himself smiling inside and outside the building — and said a harsher sentence was needed as a warning to others. Advertisement  “There have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home,” Chutkan said at the time.Other judges aren’t convinced that time behind bars is justified for people pleading guilty to low-level, nonviolent crimes, or if a relatively short stint in jail is even the most effective way to make the punishment “hurt,” in the words of one judge. They’ve crafted sentences featuring combinations of probation, fines, home detention, computer monitoring, social media restrictions, mental health treatment, job training, and community service.With new cases being filed every week, 71 sentences is too small a number to confirm patterns for how the rest of these cases will play out. There’s too little data, for instance, to say whether the political pathways that judges took to the bench manifest in the sentences they hand down. Judges nominated by presidents of both parties, including Trump, have mixed records of ordering jail versus probation for Capitol rioters. But most judges have only presided over a handful of sentencings, and some judges haven’t sentenced anyone yet.Still, enough cases have reached the final phase to understand what judges are thinking about as they mete out justice. They’re aware of the intense media coverage of these cases and the fact that the court allows the public to dial in to hear live audio of most hearings, a pandemic-related expansion of access. They’re keeping an eye on the investigation into Jan. 6 that’s unfolding in Congress, and they’re paying close attention to what their colleagues are doing — sometimes publicly signaling when they agree or disagree with another judge’s decision or comments. Advertisement  There was the case where US District Judge Trevor McFadden accused the Justice Department of not being “even-handed” in its response to Jan. 6 compared to the protests last summer against racism and police brutality — comments that prompted Chutkan in another case to say she disagreed with McFadden, calling it a “false equivalence.” It was one of the few times where the broader political discourse seemed to seep into public exchanges among judges; McFadden was nominated by Trump, Chutkan by former president Barack Obama. There was the case where US District Judge Rudolph Contreras accused prosecutors of ramping up their sentencing recommendations because they were yelled at by another judge.Several judges have expressed concern about the case of Anna Morgan-Lloyd, who made an emotional plea for leniency to US District Judge Royce Lamberth and received probation. Morgan-Lloyd then went on Fox News the day after her sentencing and made comments that seemed to minimize the violence at the Capitol. Morgan-Lloyd’s lawyer has insisted her client got “played” by Fox and was honest with Lamberth, but judges have held up her case as a cautionary tale against giving too much weight to after-the-fact expressions of remorse.Lamberth, meanwhile, has made it known that he felt burned by Morgan-Lloyd. When Frank Scavo of Pennsylvania came before the judge last month after pleading guilty to the same parading misdemeanor, Lamberth blew past the two-week jail sentence that the government argued for, sentencing Scavo to 60 days.A few judges have complained that charging decisions by prosecutors tied their hands in crafting sentences.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson has questioned prosecutors about the wisdom of entering plea deals for a misdemeanor that restricted the options that judges had for ordering extended court supervision. US District Judge Carl Nichols expressed the same concern at a November sentencing for David Mish of Wisconsin, saying he was “very torn” because he thought Mish could benefit from longer-term contact with the court. Nichols ended up sending Mish to jail for 30 days, citing his previous criminal record as well as the need to deter others. Advertisement  
 


It’s not the first time that federal judges in Washington have been faced with novel questions of law with massive implications for the legitimacy of the US government and its institutions. The court has presided over legal entanglements from some of the biggest political scandals in modern history — Watergate, Whitewater and the Clinton affair, the Russia probe — as well as the crush of cases filed by people captured in the War on Terror after 9/11 challenging their indefinite detention at the US military installation in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The sheer number of Jan. 6 cases sets this prosecution effort apart. A prosecutor recently said in court that the government believed that 2,000 to 2,500 people illegally went inside the Capitol, far more than the estimate of 800 people that a US Capitol Police official gave Congress early on. Prosecutors and Justice Department officials haven’t said if there’s a target number for when they’ll end the investigation. Advertisement  The seven people sentenced for felonies have all received prison time. Paul Hodgkins of Florida, who pleaded guilty to obstructing Congress, had tried to argue for no time behind bars since he hadn’t engaged in violence or destruction; he went onto the Senate floor and carried a “TRUMP” flag. US District Judge Randolph Moss said probation wasn’t an option and ordered him to spend eight months in prison, less than the 18 months sought by prosecutors. It was a benchmark-setting hearing that spelled bad news for any defendant hoping to stay out of prison with a felony plea deal.People needed to know that assaulting the Capitol and interfering with the democratic process “will have severe consequences,” the judge said at the time.Of the 64 people sentenced for a misdemeanor offense, 36 — more than half — received sentences that were lighter than what the government recommended as far as loss of liberty, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis. That included 14 cases where judges rejected the government’s recommendation of prison time altogether, nine cases where judges ordered a period of incarceration that was shorter than the government’s request, and 13 cases where judges didn’t agree with the government’s recommendation of a short period of home confinement as a condition of probation.
 


Forty defendants who pleaded guilty to misdemeanors — roughly two-thirds — avoided time behind bars, receiving home confinement and probation, or probation alone.The remaining 24 misdemeanor offenders were incarcerated. Nine people received prison sentences that were more severe than what the government requested, with judges either going above the amount of incarceration prosecutors asked for or rejecting a recommendation of probation. Nine people received prison sentences that fell below the government’s recommendation, and six received time behind bars that matched the government’s request.Jail sentences for misdemeanor offenders have ranged from as short as 14 days to as long as six months, although in the two cases to hit that high end the defendants already had been in jail after their arrests and were sentenced to the time they’d served.US District Judge Thomas Hogan ordered Robert Reeder to spend three months in jail, less than the six months prosecutors argued for after new evidence emerged that he’d been involved in a physical confrontation with police. Hogan said he wanted his sentence to signal that other rioters should expect jail time. But he explained that he didn’t think six months was appropriate because Reeder didn’t have a previous criminal record and the judge wasn’t sold that the evidence showed Reeder deliberately struck an officer with his fist.The person-specific facts of each case make it hard to do apples-to-apples comparisons, but some cases feature similar overarching narratives. Russell Peterson of Pennsylvania livestreamed on Facebook — “The Capitol is ours right now,” he said at one point — and prosecutors accused him of downplaying the violence afterward. The government asked for two weeks in jail. Jackson sentenced him to 30 days. Prosecutors wanted 60 days in jail for Glenn Croy of Colorado, arguing he’d entered the Capitol twice, treated the breach like a “vacation” by taking and posing for photos, and sent messages after that disputed the level of violence. Howell sentenced him to three months of home confinement and three years of probation. Advertisement     Howell has used some of the strongest language this year denouncing the insurrection and questioning prosecutors’ decision not to press more serious charges against participants. But in several misdemeanor cases, she’s rejected the government’s jail recommendations, pointing to other cases where prosecutors asked for probation for rioters who pleaded guilty to the same crimes and saying she also had an obligation to avoid “unwarranted” differences. She blasted the government’s “muddled” approach and blamed prosecutors for undercutting their own efforts.Howell’s sentences have included a period of home confinement and probation for Jack Griffith, a Tennessee man who was recorded on video screaming in excitement as he entered the Capitol and whose extensive social media posts afterward suggested a lack of remorse. Prosecutors had asked for three months of incarceration. As part of his sentence, Howell ordered the probation office to monitor his computer activity and barred him from using any social media platforms without getting permission first.Some judges have turned to hitting people’s pockets. In 16 cases, judges ordered defendants to pay fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 as an additional penalty beyond probation or jail; in 13 of those cases, the sentences were otherwise lighter than the government’s recommendation.Fines levied by judges are on top of agreements defendants have made to pay restitution to the US government as part of their plea deals — $500 for a misdemeanor plea, and $1,000 to $2,000 for a felony plea. Between fines ordered by judges and restitution agreements, the 160-plus rioters who have entered guilty pleas owe $148,500, roughly 10% of the nearly $1.5 million that the government has estimated in damage to the Capitol.

When US District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced the Vinsons, overruling the government’s request for jail time for Lori Vinson, he explained that one reason for that was he didn’t think the cost of incarcerating her was worth it. He said that he’d rather have the couple contribute toward the cost of repairing the Capitol and jail would only delay their ability to do that.“​​I want the sentence to hurt, because people have to understand that if you do something like this, it’s going to hurt,” Walton said, ordering them each to pay $5,000.Walton took the same approach this month in sentencing Anthony Mariotto of Florida. The prosecutor asked for four months of incarceration, arguing his misdemeanor case was more serious because of how far he’d made it into the building — he posted a selfie on Facebook from the Senate gallery, smiling, with a caption that included, “This is our house” — and the fact that he recorded assaults on police, knocked on doors, and seemed to minimize his role in an interview later.Walton sentenced Mariotto to pay a $5,000 fine and spend three years on probation. The judge said he believed that participating in the insurrection was a serious enough offense to merit incarceration. But he said he also didn’t think it was realistic to try to jail every defendant, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate since other defendants who pleaded guilty to the same crime received probation. Advertisement     Some judges have used the public platform they have at these sentencing hearings to make their feelings about what happened on Jan. 6 known. They’ve emphasized the seriousness of the insurrection, disputed narratives that have sprung up among right-wing politicians and pundits that rioters were “tourists” or that incarcerated defendants are “political prisoners,” and called out some of the bold-face names who haven’t been criminally charged — Trump and his allies who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was stolen (and continue to do so).When US District Judge Rudolph Contreras earlier this month rejected the government’s request for jail time for Felipe Marquez of Florida, the judge explained that he believed Marquez would be better served by home confinement and probation, plus a set of additional conditions including mental health treatment, job training, and other support. The judge said that Jan. 6 was the result of an “unprecedented” series of events, spurred on by Trump and his allies who “bear much responsibility” for what happened.At a sentencing in November, US District Judge Amit Mehta said that defendant John Lolos of Washington state was “a pawn in a game that’s played and directed by people who should know better.” Prosecutors wanted 30 days in jail for Lolos, who entered the Capitol through a broken window, chanted in support of the mob as he walked through the building, and yelled, “They left! We did it!” as he left. He came to law enforcement’s attention when he was kicked off a plane after the riot for being disruptive and chanting, “Trump 2020!” Mehta sentenced him to 14 days.“People like Mr. Lolos were told lies and falsehoods and told that an election was stolen when it clearly was not,” Mehta said. “Regrettably, people like Mr. Lolos for whatever reason are impressionable and will believe such falsehoods and such lies ... and they are the ones who are suffering the consequences.” Advertisement     No judge has found that individual rioters weren’t culpable because they were corrupted by online conspiracy theories or inspired by Trump.“No one was swept away to the Capitol,” Jackson said at Russell Peterson’s sentencing this month. “No one was carried. The rioters were adults. And this defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.” ●

As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.”Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia. Advertisement  “I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.”
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.”“I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.”Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.” Advertisement  
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

This is an excerpt from Quibbles & Bits, the BuzzFeed News copy desk’s newsletter. Sign up below to nerd out about language and style with us once a month!
 


It’s been a long year! 2021 has led the BuzzFeed copy desk in new directions and presented us with new predicaments about how to use language in the news. From the very first week of 2021, the events of Jan. 6 forced us to navigate big questions: Is this an insurrection or an attempted coup or a domestic terrorist attack? Did that person steal a podium or a lectern? Are the words “protesters” and “demonstrators” too legitimizing? Can we call it a riot?We will likely be looking back at Jan. 6 and its fallout for the rest of our lives, and news stories will serve as artifacts of how journalists characterized it in real time. The copy desk is always weighing the ramifications of our words and determining what is the most truthful and fair. And as with any semantic discussion in the news world, we need to question whether language we’ve ascribed to an event is obsolete, whether it’s evolved, and whether it accurately fits the situation.In each issue of our Quibbles & Bits newsletter this year, we’ve shared how our copy desk has processed language and given a behind-the-scenes look at BuzzFeed News’ decision-making — and sometimes how other news outlets are working through these topics as well. Advertisement     Here are the discussions we had this year:In March, we debunked eight grammar and language myths you’ve likely been victimized by. These have been taught by generations of schoolteachers, reinforced by old-fashioned style books, and gleefully (but wrongly) championed in Twitter hypercorrections. We implore you to forget them.Two weeks later, we unpacked how something as tiny as a hyphen can have a big impact on language. Inspired by Twitter user @challahbackjew and research from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the Anti-Defamation League, we shared our style change on the word antisemitism. The hyphenated form (anti-semitism), we wrote, accentuates the Semitism part and implies the existence of a Semitic race of people, an erroneous notion rooted in Nazi ideology.This summer, we spoke with autistic people about identity-first language versus person-first language. The latter, a mainstay of many newsrooms’ style guides and sensitivity guidelines, has traditionally been used to describe people with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness, or people in jail. But this trend may be receding, as many communities (including autistic, Deaf, blind, and disabled people) now generally opt for identity-first language. “We recognize that disability and personhood are not mutually exclusive; they are not oxymoronic,” Lydia X. Z. Brown told us.In September, we emphasized the need to uncover the origins of modern slang, which is often rooted in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). When we divorce language from its context, we risk further oppressing not only Black people but also the communities they intersect with, including other people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. Black culture is not deserving of mockery or appropriation — it demands respect.Then, in November, we noted that ableist phrasing is ubiquitous in modern language, from clichés to callous analogies that devalue disabled people. Some examples are obvious, like “crippling” or “handicap,” but others are more nuanced and require a perceptive copy editor to think about whether the words are dubious in context. Advertisement     On a different front, we developed some style quizzes (we are the BuzzFeed copy desk; we must contain multitudes). We typically use these to test our colleagues in the newsroom, but we publish them for the readers who are so inclined to take them.

No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.”It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate. Advertisement  But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future.
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day.Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted. Advertisement  “It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital.“He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3. Advertisement  Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey.“The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded. Advertisement  “It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes.Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.” Advertisement  
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking.That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything. Advertisement     “I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.”Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.” Advertisement     Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida.“I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

Governments around the world are struggling to suppress a tidal wave of the Omicron variant, which appears to be spreading faster and evading vaccines more efficiently than any previous COVID-19 variant. Most developed nations have responded to this threat by encouraging their populations to get booster shots and doubling down on vaccination efforts on their home turf.As the head of a global organization dedicated to vaccinating the world, I can see that focusing on this alone is a dangerous mistake.If the priority with each new variant of concern is to race toward reopening society by offering boosters instead of tackling the root cause — namely, the fact that nearly 3.5 billion people still have not been vaccinated — then we could face an endless cycle of resurgences and leave the door open for more dangerous variants. Advertisement     This crisis is far from over, and we will never end it until we stop the virus from spreading in all parts of the world.Even though clinical infection with Omicron appears to be more resistant to vaccines, to the best of our knowledge, global vaccination still remains the most effective way to protect people from severe disease and death. Vaccination, even in the Omicron era, likely prevents the overwhelming of health systems and slows transmission, preventing further mutations and new variants from emerging.Yet, more than a year after COVID-19 vaccines first became available, about 43% of the world — predominantly people living in the poorest countries — have not yet had their first shot.Initially, the main reason for this was vaccine hoarding by the world’s wealthiest countries, as well as export restrictions imposed by some countries on both vaccines and the materials needed to make them.This has severely hampered the global effort led by COVAX — a collaboration between Gavi, my organization, UNICEF, WHO, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — to make COVID-19 vaccines equitably available to people in all corners of the world, particularly the 92 lower-income countries that would have otherwise struggled to get access.The good news is that with 1.5 billion doses now being manufactured a month and 12 billion expected to be produced in total by the end of the year — enough to fully vaccinate everyone on this planet — global supply constraints are now easing and governments are throwing their weight behind COVAX. Advertisement     By the end of the month, COVAX will have allocated 1.6 billion doses and will have shipped over 900 million doses to 144 economies, the vast majority to lower-income countries. And by early 2022, we will have shipped enough doses to reach our original target of protecting on average around 20% of people in most of these countries, including all those most at risk, such as frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable people.However, the danger now with Omicron is that if governments once again turn their attention inward and focus all attention toward making boosters available to their citizens, it could again start to hinder equitable access and further prolong the global crisis. Or if the science determines that new variant-specific vaccines are necessary, it seems likely these new vaccines could be hoarded and not made available to those living in lower-income countries.At first glance, the case for boosters may seem strong, with evidence to suggest that a third dose can provide additional protection and prevent people from becoming infected. But while this could help to slow the spread of this new variant, we still don’t know Omicron’s potential to cause harm.Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that two doses of existing vaccines are any less effective against Omicron in protecting people from severe disease, hospitalization, or death. This means that getting boosters to low-risk people who already have some protection will only have a limited impact on fighting the disease if we don’t also radically reduce the number of people who are still unvaccinated.Yet, since Omicron emerged, we have already started to see some donor governments slowing the speed at which they are donating vaccines to COVAX, and if high-income countries increase their purchases of products, the worry now is that COVAX’s own supply lines will start to suffer. Advertisement     Boosters are only ever likely to provide a temporary fix so long as the virus is allowed to spread freely elsewhere in the world. It does now seem highly likely that the COVID-19 endgame will mean it eventually becomes endemic. But we will get no closer to that point if, with each resurgence, we don’t start addressing the cause of new variants. That must be the priority for 2022: getting primary doses to everyone.If we end up in a situation where we face Pi, Rho, Sigma, or Tao variants, and fourth, fifth, or sixth booster shots are being offered to some people while billions of others are still waiting on their first, then we really shouldn’t wonder why we are still in a state of global crisis.

429,Remembering some of the people in the public eye who died this year.,"


Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking charges Wednesday, bringing an end to the federal case in which she stood accused of assisting Jeffrey Epstein in his decadelong scheme of grooming and sexually abusing girls as young as 14.The Associated Press reported that Maxwell was found guilty of five of the six federal charges against her. She now faces years in prison.In the government’s closing argument on Dec. 20, Assistant US Attorney Alison Moe described Maxwell as a “dangerous” woman who “preyed on vulnerable kids.”“Maxwell was a sophisticated predator who knew exactly what she was doing. She ran the same playbook again and again,” Moe said. “She manipulated her victims, and she groomed them for sexual abuse. She caused deep and lasting harm to young girls. It is time to hold her accountable.” Advertisement     The 60-year-old daughter of a British media magnate, Maxwell is the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Epstein, the former financier and convicted sex offender, whose death in prison while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges on Aug. 10, 2019, was ruled a suicide. With his death coming before he faced a jury, Maxwell’s case marked a major milestone in a saga that has stretched decades, only drawing renewed attention after a series of articles in the Miami Herald highlighting how the justice system had failed the women who said they were abused.She was arrested on July 20, 2020, after disappearing from the public eye for more than a year. (The FBI tracked Maxwell to Bradford, New Hampshire, using data and coordinates from her cellphone.) She was deemed a flight risk and has been held without bail since her arrest. She was found guilty of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor. The jury found her not guilty of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, the AP reported.""I want to commend the bravery of the girls — now grown women — who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom,"" US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict was announced. ""Their courage and willingness to face their abuser made this case, and today’s result, possible.""Maxwell had pleaded not guilty to all the charges and declined to testify, claiming “there is no need” for her to do so because “the government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.” Advertisement     During the three-week trial, four women testified that Epstein had sexually abused them while they were between the ages of 14 and 17, and that Maxwell assisted in grooming them and occasionally participated in the abuse herself. According to prosecutors and the victims’ testimonies, Maxwell and Epstein sought out vulnerable young girls — particularly those in need of money, with single mothers and difficult home lives — and made them feel special and cared for, taking them shopping and to the movies, offering to pay for school, and asking them about their lives.Maxwell and Epstein were extravagantly wealthy and had many powerful, famous friends. One of the victims said they introduced her to both Donald Trump and Prince Andrew when she was 14, but did not accuse either of any misconduct. Epstein’s former pilot testified that Trump and Prince Andrew had been passengers on the private jet, as were Bill Clinton, actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, senators John Glenn and George Mitchell, and violinist Itzhak Perlman.Maxwell would serve as a normalizing presence during the meticulous grooming process, bringing up sexual topics, being naked or topless around them, and encouraging them to give Epstein massages. These massages were how Epstein typically initiated sexual contact with his victims — often with Maxwell in the room and instructing them how to touch him, to give the teenagers the impression what they were having done to them was normal, the women said. The sexual abuse would ramp up after that, often several times a week for years, with the girls at times being flown on Epstein’s private jet to visit him at his various homes.Maxwell was frequently present during these encounters, the women said, goading them into sex acts with Epstein. At times, Maxwell was also an active participant in the sexual abuse — three of the witnesses testified she had touched their breasts. One said Maxwell had her wear a schoolgirl outfit to serve Epstein tea, and another said she was made to participate in group sexual encounters with the couple and other people. Advertisement     “It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,” said one of the victims, who testified under the pseudonym Jane. “When you’re 14, you have no idea what’s going on.”This was precisely what made Maxwell “key to the whole operation,” Moe, the prosecutor, said in her closing argument.“Epstein could not have done this alone,” Moe said. “A single middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visit his ranch, to come to his house, to fly to New York, is creepy. That sets off alarm bells.”“But when that man is accompanied by a posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that’s when everything starts to seem legitimate,” she continued. “And when that woman encourages those girls to massage that man, when she acts like it’s totally normal for the man to touch those girls, it lures them into a trap. It allows the man to silence the alarm bells and get away with molesting girls.”
 


Throughout the trial and in their closing argument, defense attorneys worked to discredit the witnesses’ testimonies, questioning whether their memories of the abuse were faulty or even outright invented. They also repeatedly accused the women of just being out for money, pointing to the fact that all four had previously received large settlements from a compensation fund for Epstein’s victims. Advertisement     They also claimed Maxwell was innocent of anything Epstein might have done, suggesting she was being treated as a scapegoat because he is no longer alive to face the consequences.In the defense’s closing argument, attorney Laura Menninger hammered these points home, claiming the women had “erroneous memories” and that their “stories have changed dramatically over time.” She honed in on minor discrepancies and details the accusers had not been certain of, even saying one was “like an actress who forgot her lines.”“As we have said from the beginning, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein,” Menninger said. “She’s being tried here for being with Jeffrey Epstein. Maybe that was the biggest mistake of her life, but it was not a crime.”In their rebuttal, the government urged the jury not to get “distracted by [the defense’s] nonsense.”“Never mind that [the accusers’ stories] corroborate each other, never mind the mountain of evidence that backs those four up, the defense is desperate for you not to believe these women,” Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey said. “So they’re throwing up anything they can think of at the wall to see if anything will stick, but if you think about those arguments for just a little bit, you’ll see they don’t hold any water.”Comey hit back hard against the defense’s attempts to discredit the accusers’ memories, saying it would mean believing “all four of these women had a massive false memory event that just happened to include details of the defendant grooming them in the same way, using the same playbook.” Advertisement     “Some things you never forget because they’re seared into your brain forever,” she said.The defense also described the idea that Maxwell — a fixture in Epstein’s life — was simply unaware of the abuse as “borderline laughable.”“Of course she knew that her boyfriend, when he was spending time with teenage girls … he was doing it because he was attracted to them, because he wanted to have sex with them,” Comey said. “The suggestion that she didn’t know borders on the absurd.”Comey closed out her rebuttal by calling on the jury to “use your common sense” and believe the testimony of the four women who took the stand.“The defendant never thought that those teenage girls would have the strength to report what happened to them. In her eyes, they were just trash, beneath her,” Comey said. “Those girls would never stand up to a power couple like Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell — and if they ever did, who would believe them?”“But the defendant didn’t count on those teenage girls growing up into the women who testified at this trial — women who would be willing to take that stand and tell the truth about what happened,” she said.

The White House on Wednesday dug in against critics of the new CDC guidelines that shortened the recommended isolation period from 10 days to five days for asymptomatic people infected by the coronavirus.Announced on Monday, the guidelines halved the isolation time — the period when people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should not be in contact with others — to five days. The five days begin when someone first shows symptoms; people should only emerge from the isolation afterward if those symptoms have stopped. They should then wear “well-fitting” masks for the next five days, according to the new guidelines, rather than continue in isolation. The change comes as COVID-19 cases hit their highest numbers for the entire pandemic, more than 240,000 cases a day on average. Advertisement     The revised policy attracted criticism from many outside public health experts, who said a negative antigen test should be required before someone ends their isolation, or that the shorter isolation should apply only to vaccinated people. The changes came just days after the CDC relaxed recommendations for infected healthcare workers to seven days of isolation, with a negative test.“Let me make clear that we are standing on the shoulders of two years of science, two years of understanding transmissibility,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday, defending the five-day guideline.Around 85% to 90% of viral transmissions, the “vast majority,” she said, happen in the first one to two days before people feel symptoms, and within the two to three days of those symptoms starting. COVID-19 symptoms include a cough, sore throat, headache, fever, chills, lost sense of taste, diarrhea, and other cold and flulike complaints.Walensky said that PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 genes could give positive results for weeks after a person ceases being infectious, making them useless in isolation decisions. The CDC did not recommend a negative antigen test before ending isolation, she added, because the results, positive or negative, do not definitively show whether someone is still infectious. “On the other hand, we know that after five days people are much less likely to transmit the virus and that masking further reduces that risk,” Walensky said, pointing to the five days of masking required after the isolation period as significant added protection. Advertisement     Nevertheless, critics such as University of Saskatchewan virologist Angela Rasmussen argue that a positive antigen test does point to some significant amount of virus still present in a patient, meaning they could be infectious. People should have that information before ending isolation, she suggested on Twitter, in response to Walensky.
 


The CDC’s relaxed policy has sparked derision on Twitter, where satirical takes on the agency’s permissiveness have (perhaps excessively) taken off:
 


But some independent experts have defended the agency’s reasoning.
 


Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday via email that he welcomed the news.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.”Yet Adalja cautioned that antigen testing would improve the protocol. “Rapid antigen tests, if they were widely available, should also be used to precision-guide these durations.”At the Wednesday White House briefing, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci cited continuing signs that the Omicron variant, now responsible for the majority of US cases, tends to cause severe illness less often.However, it’s unclear whether this means Omicron is an intrinsically less dangerous bug than previous variants. It could also be that Omicron seems milder because it is infecting more vaccinated people, who are mostly protected from severe disease.“Increased transmissibility of Omicron resulting in an extremely high volume of cases may override some of the impact of the lower disease severity,” Fauci said. “So we should not become complacent.”David Mack contributed reporting to this story.

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes. Advertisement  
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause. Advertisement  
 


Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

435,Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests ,"


The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes. Advertisement  
 


This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine.

Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

437,"The summer of 2021, punctuated by extreme heat and flooding, showed that climate change is already deadly.","


By 1964, just three years after she started writing searching personal essays for Vogue, Joan Didion was plainly itching to write about something other than herself. Her life was also changing. She had published a slim novel, Run River, whose journey to the bookstore had been a grand disappointment. The title had been chosen by the publisher, and the editor had altered the form of the novel entirely, changing its experimental structure into something quite conventional. She had also married John Gregory Dunne, a sometime friend, after he’d supported her through the end of a long love affair. The pair decided to quit their magazine jobs and move to California, where they had a vague plan to make careers in television.Vogue, apparently unwilling to cut apron strings altogether, asked Didion to begin reviewing films for it. In her opening column for 1964, written just a month before she married, Didion declared her critical approach would be somewhat democratic:Let me lay it on the line: I like movies, and approach them with a tolerance so fond that it will possibly strike you as simple-minded. To engage my glazed attention a movie need be no classic of its kind, need be neither L’Avventura or Red River, neither Casablanca nor Citizen Kane; I ask only that it have its moments.She went on to cast positive votes for The Philadelphia Story, The Spirit of St Louis, and Charade. Pauline Kael had not yet quite broken through to mainstream movie reviewing and I Lost It at the Movies hadn’t yet been published, but we can see in Didion’s words a relatively similar approach. She too would spend her career insisting there were moments of brilliance even in what was unquestionably trash.
 


Didion alternated her assignment on the movies with another writer, which seems to have prevented her from reviewing memorable films. She was trying to write with flair, though, in short spaces, and most of the reviews are sprightly, wisecracking things that seem more like Parker than Didion. She hated The Pink Panther: “possibly the only seduction ever screened (David Niven vs. The Princess) with all the banality of the real thing.” She liked The Unsinkable Molly Brown, but commented that Debbie Reynolds “tends to play these things as if the West was won by jumping up and down and shouting at it.” She confessed a weakness for teenage surfing movies, “an enthusiasm I should try to pass off as sociological.” Like Kael, she too hated The Sound of Music, calling it:More embarrassing than most, if only because of its suggestion that history need not happen to people like Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer. Just whistle a happy tune, and leave the Anschluss behind.Gradually, though, Didion got bored with film reviews. Her review of The Sound of Music was so caustic that Vogue fired her, as she tells it. (This was another connection to Kael, who had been fired for panning the same movie at McCall’s.) In any event, she was moving on to other subjects in a column that she and Dunne soon set up at the Saturday Evening Post.
 


At the Post, Didion’s writing would undergo a major shift in tone, too. There are hints of the elegiac, distinctive earlier Didion voice in “On Self-Respect,” and in another essay she wrote for Vogue on American summers. But, given the Post’s willingness to send her into the field, she found a groove. It helped that California of the 1960s was fertile ground for twisting stories that provided Didion with the opportunity to follow a disturbing note longer than a column or two. She started off writing for the Post about Helen Gurley Brown (whom she found silly) and John Wayne (whom she did not), but it was the first of the crime pieces that hit a chord with the magazine’s readers — and also reads as the first true Didion piece.It was titled “How Can I Tell Them There’s Nothing Left?” But the title Didion would give it in her own collection, “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream,” was the one that would stick. Nominally chronicling a local murder, in which a wife was accused of burning her husband to death in the family car, Didion immediately pulled back to a wide-angle view of everything that was plaguing California, not to mention most of the rest of America:This is the California where it is easy to Dial-a-Devotion, but hard to buy a book. This is the country in which a belief in the literal interpretation of Genesis has slipped imperceptibly into a belief in the literal interpretation of Double Indemnity, the country of the teased hair and the Capris and the girls for whom all life’s promise comes down to a waltz-length white wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or a Sherry or a Debbi and a Tijuana divorce and a return to hairdresser’s school.The woman was eventually convicted of murdering her husband, but naturally the residents of the San Bernardino valley—the part of California Didion was describing in that long, unwinding opening paragraph—did not take kindly to being characterized this way. “I am worried about Joan Didion,” wrote one Howard B. Weeks, who also listed his profession: vice president for public relations and development at Loma Linda University. “We recognize these feelings as symptoms commonly observed in young New York writers who venture into the Great Unknown beyond the Hudson.” This letter illustrates that Didion hadn’t quite yet broken through to the mainstream; Howard B. Weeks did not know he was lecturing the woman who would become the signature American writer from California on the subject of her own home.Didion did not slide into her groove immediately. The next piece she wrote seemed almost a step away from anything that could possibly annoy anyone. It was entitled “The Big Rock Candy Figgy Pudding Pitfall.” Despite her having savaged Helen Gurley Brown and J. D. Salinger for being essentially trivial persons, one guesses this was the kind of piece Didion wrote for money. It details an effort to cook twenty figgy puddings and make twenty hard-candy trees. But it seemed to reflect a state of distress about how her domestic arrangements were working out:I am frail, lazy and unsuited to doing anything except what I am paid to do, which is sit by myself and type with one finger. I like to imagine myself a “can-do” kind of woman, capable of patching the corral fence, pickling enough peaches to feed the hands all winter, and then winning a trip to Minneapolis in the Pillsbury Bake-Off. In fact, the day I stop believing that if put to it I could win the Pillsbury Bake-Off will signal the death of something.Dunne appears in this article as a benevolent, comic figure, who upon confrontation with the supplies asks, “Exactly what kind of therapy are we up to this week?” But nowhere in this article does Didion mention that earlier that year, she and Dunne had adopted a child they named Quintana Roo Dunne. The anxiety, though, about being some kind of domestic goddess—“the kind of woman who made hard-candy topiary trees and figgy puddings”—smells of what the women’s magazines all call nesting.
 


For one of the first issues of the new year, she wrote an essay the magazine entitled “Farewell to the Enchanted City.” (Later generations of readers would come to know it better by the title “Goodbye to All That.”) This was when the first hint of her career-long obsession with the stories we tell ourselves would begin to explicitly emerge. Didion suggests that the New York of her imagination had dominated the real one the whole time she actually lived there:Some instinct, programmed by all the movies I had ever seen and all the songs I had ever heard about New York, informed me that it would never be quite the same again. In fact it never was. Some time later there was a song in the jukeboxes on the Upper East Side that went “but where is the schoolgirl who used to be me,” and if it was late enough at night I used to wonder that. I know now that almost everyone wonders something like that, sooner or later and no matter what he or she is doing, but one of the mixed blessings of being twenty and twenty-one and even twenty-three is the conviction that nothing like this, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, has ever happened to anyone before.
 


This essay is so famous it is said to have spawned its own mini genre of essays about leaving New York. Like the song on the jukebox, it expresses the feelings everyone has about a common experience. The brilliance of the essay is that even in the act of writing it Didion reenacts an emotional cliché, the narrator telling a past self how silly and stupid she was to fall for a story that everyone falls for. This self-conscious style, a personal matter conveyed at a distance, would become Didion’s signature. Even when she wrote about something as personal as her divorce, she did it at a remove, turning it over in her hand, polishing it to a shine that concealed certain roughnesses in the center.Dunne and Didion soon had a regular column in the Saturday Evening Post, sharing a byline. It looks odd to contemporary eyes, especially because of the illustration the magazine used at the top of each column, drawings of them both. If Dunne had written the column, the illustration would show his face in front of Didion’s; if she had written it, her face would move in front of his.Her columns were generally the more interesting explorations of the pair, her knack for inspiring a reaction was top-notch. Her essay on migraines would appear in that space, as would her reporting of a decommissioned Alcatraz and a devastating sketch of Nancy Reagan, then the first lady of California:She has told me that the governor never wore makeup even in motion pictures and that politics is rougher than the picture business because you do not have the studio to protect you . . . “Having a pretty place to work is important to a man,” she has advised me. She has shown me the apothecary jar of hard candies she keeps filled on the governor’s desk.Almost a month later, Nancy Reagan was still smarting from the sting, telling the Fresno Bee, “I thought we were getting along fine together. Maybe it would have been better if I snarled a bit.”This technique—appearing to let the subject simply carry on without interruption from Didion’s evaluations or thoughts making themselves absurd—became her standard mode of operation. It would be the way she would spend large swaths of her famous explorations in Haight-Ashbury. She would begin the essay with a long incantation about how the “center was not holding,” then trek into the widening abyss to find people who would reveal themselves in a line or two. Meeting two young Deadheads, for example:I ask a couple of girls what they do. “I just kind of come out here a lot,” one of them says. “I just sort of know the Dead,” the other says.The flatness of these answers spoke for the emptiness of those who spoke them. Most of the readers of the Saturday Evening Post agreed with Didion on this point, the letters unusually full of praise for her insight into the barbarians of the hippie cult, as it was popular to call them at the time. There were some objectors, like Sunnie “The Daisy” Brentwood, who continued to insist that “the majority of the flower children are good kids who are trying to improve the world and make it a better place to live.”
 


Didion’s view won out in the end, not least because this essay would become the title piece of her stand-alone 1968 collection Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the book that established Didion’s reputation. Reviewing it for the New York Times, Didion’s friend Dan Wakefield argued that Didion was “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation.” He pointed out that Didion was easier to interpret, for example, than another trendy young woman writer of the moment named Susan Sontag. Wakefield’s thorough celebration of the book was echoed by just about every reviewer. Some of them stumbled over the pairing of Didion’s brilliance with her gender: Melvin Maddocks of the Christian Science Monitor cryptically remarked, in what appeared to be a compliment:Journalism by women is the price the man’s world pays for having disappointed them. Here at their best are the unforgiving eye, the unforgetting ear, the concealed hat-pin style.That is one way of looking at it; though the reference to hat pins is clearly trivializing, the notion that the opinions were a “price” rather than a gift is somewhat revealing. Didion had cultivated a persona in her writing that was just as disappointed with women—Gurley Brown, the Deadheads, Nancy Reagan, the figgy pudding domestics—as it was with the “man’s world,” wherever that was. It wasn’t feminine so much as just perceptive, sharp. Certain doors of perception are more open to women, but it doesn’t mean that men can’t see what women are pointing out, if only they’d settle down, listen, and look.After Slouching Towards Bethlehem, the literary profilers came out of the woodwork. In droves, they began to interview her, attaching the beautiful photographs of her slight frame to headlines like “Joan Didion: Writer with Razor’s Edge,” and “Slouching Towards Joan Didion.” It was by then the 1970s. Alfred Kazin, that old friend of Hannah Arendt’s, promptly got himself assigned to fly out to California. He met the Didion-Dunnes in high spirits at the house they then occupied in Malibu, together writing a screenplay based on Play It as It Lays, her 1970 novel about a dissatisfied actress named Maria Wyeth that had gotten her rave reviews. Kazin noted the difference between the way Didion often spoke of herself in print: as fragile, ill, on the verge of divorce in a famous Life column in 1969, and the way she was in person, more a creature of sensible steel than frivolous silk:Joan Didion is a creature of many advantages, as is clear from her own belief that she had the sense to get born and to grow up in Sacramento before so many discomfiting things began to happen to the Golden State.Kazin continued to catalog discrepancies. Didion’s voice was “so much stronger than her own little girl’s voice!” Though the address in Malibu would seem to connote relaxation, he finds the sound of the waves below deafening: “People who live in a beach house don’t know how wary it makes them.” He called her a moralist, pointed out that she had an obsession with seriousness. He notes that always she was writing as a cultural critic, even in fiction, wanting to diagnose the ills of whatever subject she had—a propensity she shared with Mary McCarthy, though their fiction voices are far apart. He even connected her with Arendt, who had once told him that Americans seemed to despair far more than she had ever seen people do in Europe.By the time Kazin’s profile was published, Didion was, quite simply, a star. But the Saturday Evening Post, the place that had let her write lyrically about migraines, about going home to Sacramento, or that flew her to Hawaii for a piece, had folded. She looked for other homes. Life magazine offered her a contract to write a column. But the relationship soured immediately; Didion asked to go to Saigon, because many writers—including Sontag and McCarthy—had already been there. Her editor demurred, telling her that “some of the guys are going out.” Her anger at this blithe dismissal turned into the now-famous column she wrote about visiting Hawaii during the prediction of a huge tidal wave:My husband switches off the television set and stares out the window. I avoid his eyes, and brush the baby’s hair. In the absence of a natural disaster we are left again to our own uneasy devices. We are here on this island in the middle of the Pacific in lieu of filing for divorce.
 


This essay poses as self-revelation, but here the frame of marital trouble dissolves. Didion begins telling you instead how disconnected she had felt from everything, how difficult it was to feel. She confesses that she has become, as that old boyfriend predicted, someone who feels nothing. The piece is so relentlessly dark and despairing it is no wonder the Life editors were apparently startled by it. They gave it a title that reflected their bewilderment: “A Problem of Making Connections.” Subsequent deeply personal columns were not to their taste either, and Didion would end up relinquishing the contract before it was up because the editors would not run her column. She would get back at the editor for his nonchalant remark many years later, when she’d report it in The Year of Magical Thinking.This hints at something important about Didion’s work: even when she is reporting unendurable despair, feeling that her life is falling apart alongside the country’s, another engine is at work there. No person as depressed and lost as Didion purports to be could possibly draft prose this precise, words that cut so directly to the heart of her subject. In the case of the confession of her potential divorce, the engine behind it was anger, anger at having been prevented from using the full measure of her powers by an editor who considered Joan Didion less daring a writer than the “guys” going out to Saigon. It was a mistake that belongs in the museum of poor editorial decisions.Didion returned to novel writing. She occasionally contributed to Esquire, but had trouble fitting in there too. She was one of the boys, clearly, in the sense that men had noticed her writing and wanted to publish her. But she also couldn’t quite fit into their regime.Still, turning to the women’s magazines would have been intolerable for her, just when the women’s liberation movement was at its height. Like Sontag, she was no doubt being asked about her loyalty to the consciousness-raising circles that were suddenly everywhere. But she does not seem to have directly commented until finally, in 1972, she published an essay called “The Women’s Movement” in the pages of the New York Times. She listed sixteen books as inspiration. But she had clearly been moved to frustration by the “special issue on women” that Time had published some months before.Didion was not willing to grant much ground or sense to the nascent second wave of feminism. She leveled some of the most direct insults of her career at it. “It seemed very New England, this febrile and cerebral passion,” she said of the radical feminist writings of Shulamith Firestone. She referred to some of the movement’s methods as Stalinist, singling out the British writer Juliet Mitchell’s relation of Maoist practice to the consciousness-raising session. She also defended Mary McCarthy from those feminist theorists who would deconstruct her heroines in The Company She Keeps and The Group into an unrecognizable, overly politicized caricature: “enslaved because she persists in looking for her identity in a man.”
 


Yet there was something less than a total rejection of the notion of feminism going on in Didion’s article. She presented herself as merely worried that what she sweepingly saw as one unified movement had become mired in arguments over trivial issues, like the division of domestic duties such as washing the dishes.Of course this litany of trivia was crucial to the movement in the beginning, a key technique in the politicizing of women who perhaps had been conditioned to obscure their resentments even from themselves . . . But such discoveries could be of no use at all if one refused to perceive the larger point, failed to make that inductive leap from the personal to the political.Didion also thought that in their books the feminists had constructed a kind of self-delusion, one she called Everywoman, “persecuted even by her gynecologist,” “raped on every date.” Didion did not deny that women were victims of condescension and sex-role stereotyping. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine how she could, given the way she was written about in the period, given her inability to fit tidily into the male-dominated magazine world. But she found the expressed wishes of the main movement writers to be childish in the extreme. “These are converts who want not a revolution but ‘romance,’” she concluded.Didion had addressed the condition of women several times before, often in the context of writing about Doris Lessing. She wrote about her twice: once for Vogue and once for the New York Times Book Review. In Vogue, she’d had only enough space to say she did not share Lessing’s view that there was some “injustice” involved in being a woman. By the time Didion was enlisted to review the science fiction novel Briefing for a Descent into Hell, she had softened her view of Lessing, in part because Lessing had softened her view of feminist politics by then. Briefing, which as Lessing termed it, was an “inner space fiction,” was more about madness and alienation than about a critique of modern social structures. And while Didion didn’t particularly like it, she went out of her way to congratulate Lessing on what she saw as Lessing’s disenchantment with all blunt forms of political thought and action, as Didion saw feminism to be:The impulse to find solutions has been not only her dilemma but the guiding delusion of her time. It is not an impulse I hold high, but there is something finally very moving about Mrs. Lessing’s tenacity.There’s a little daylight between Didion and her rejection of feminism, here. It seemed, in a cloaked way, that she had some sympathy for the aims and hopes of those feminists whose tactics and writing she still detested. It was not much, but it was something.This is something that could not really be said for the other side. Several feminist activists wrote to the Times to complain, among them Susan Brownmiller, whose Against Our Will had been listed as one of the books examined in the essay. Pointing out that Didion had never exactly positioned herself as a leftist, and had written for the National Review, Brownmiller cryptically continued:Isn’t it interesting that the real toughies are always on the other side? I’ll take boots and blue jeans over manicured, Mandarin fingernails any day of the week.The piece would cut Didion forever out of the women’s movement. In fact, it inaugurated a common complaint about her: that she was, in her own way, acting out a certain kind of stereotypical femininity. And for all her defense of complexity, she was afraid to recognize that there were any number of interior ideological fights going on in the movement she was describing: the novelist Alix Kates Shulman was on one side of the fence, and the tract-writer Shulamith Firestone on another. But in Didion’s view they were all the same, all the Everywoman, all capable of making different choices from the ones they had made.For the rest of the 1970s, Didion mostly threw herself into film-making and fiction. She and Dunne would work on a film version of Play It as It Lays, as well as an update of A Star Is Born. She published A Book of Common Prayer. She had the occasional article in Esquire, but her energy seemed subdued. The Didion-Dunnes, who had avoided divorce more than once in the intervening years, were great party givers, and that took up time too. It wouldn’t be until the end of the decade that she’d publish a second collection of nonfiction called The White Album.
 


The title essay, “The White Album,” which begins with the famous incantation, “We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” is a fragmentary bit of work. Though that first line is often quoted as a kind of self-help mantra, in the essay proper Didion goes on to list delusional fantasies, finally concluding that writers especially are guilty of imposing a kind of narrative order on existence that simply “freeze[s] the shifting phantasmagoria of our experience.”Some of the elements of the essay included projects that Didion had tried to take up, and which had failed, over the years. Specifically, she mentions an acquaintance with Linda Kasabian, the twenty-three-year-old member of the Manson family who had driven the car when a group of them murdered Sharon Tate and her houseguests in August 1969.On the outside, the Kasabian story had looked like a perfect Didion subject. Here was a person who had gotten caught up in the promises of love and grooviness that were the allure of the hippie movement—the promises that, as Didion had written, at length, were bogus. Kasabian had gone so far that she got caught up in the most notorious murders in America, murders so savage they stood out in a country that treated crime as nighttime entertainment. But Didion never got the project under way. Instead the Manson murders, and Linda Kasabian, became another dreamlike element in the political and social morass of the late 1960s, years when Didion would write that she barely knew her own mind:I remember all the day’s misinformation very clearly, and I also remember this, and wish I did not. I remember that no one was surprised.In The White Album, Didion never says what shook her out of her misery at the morally and philosophically empty conditions of the 1960s, not exactly. It could have been the films she was making, or that she was finally being recognized as a proper novelist. A Book of Common Prayer was very well received. It could be that without the violence and anomie of the 1960s, she found herself enjoying life suddenly. Quintana was growing up, her marriage got past its rough point, and she was making good money.
 


It was in the 1970s that she got very lucky. She met an editor who, like her old ones at the Saturday Evening Post, was prepared to let her talent work for itself in nonfiction articles. Bob Silvers, who was now one of the two lead editors of the New York Review of Books, was happy to let Didion roam over the pages of the magazine. Her first piece was nominally a review of Stanley Kauffmann’s film criticism in the New Republic, though Didion had other targets in mind:I used to wonder how Pauline Kael, say, could slip in and out of such airy subordinate clauses as “now that the studios are collapsing,” or how she could so misread the labyrinthine propriety of Industry evenings as to characterize “Hollywood wives” as women “whose jaws get a hard set from the nights when they sit soberly at parties waiting to take their sloshed geniuses home.”Didion proceeded to mock those, like Kael and Kauffmann, who wrote about film without having any idea how a film was produced and made. She said the most they could hope for was to bring a specific brand of intelligence to film, but that it was “a kind of petit-point-on-Kleenex effect which rarely stands much scrutiny.”Kauffmann, upon reading the review, discovered that in fact he was little-mentioned in it, and that four of the quotes Didion used had come from an entirely different book he had written. He wrote in to the New York Review to state his objection, and added:A possible reason: In the December 9, 1972, issue of the New Republic, I reviewed Miss Didion’s film Play It as It Lays, referred to her novel of that name, and stated my utter loathing of both. (On much the same grounds that she substantiates in her article: the film pretended to deal with serious subjects but was patently an industry product.) Perhaps Miss Didion would dislike my writing just as much if I had praised her work. I hope so. But your readers might care to know about a possible tit for tat.Didion was typically cutting in reply. Had he reviewed her work positively, she insisted, she would still dislike his work, and “I would also have some doubts about my own.”
 


“Self-absorption is general, as is self-doubt,” she’d memorably begin that Woody Allen piece. Her complaints about Allen were pretty much the same ones she’d voiced eighteen years before about J. D. Salinger. Allen’s characters were “clever children,” who spoke in smart remarks that no serious adult could sustain as easily. They were obsessed with trivialities when they listed among their reasons to live Willie Mays and Louis Armstrong:This list of Woody Allen’s is the ultimate consumer report, and the extent to which it has been quoted approvingly suggests a new class in America, a sub world of people rigid with apprehension that they will die wearing the wrong sneaker, naming the wrong symphony, preferring Madame Bovary.She called out the one character in Manhattan who is in high school. That was Mariel Hemingway’s Tracy, a character drawn in what Didion terms “another adolescent fantasy.” She found Tracy too utterly perfect, and with no real family to hold her back from dating Allen’s forty-year-old neurotic. A man wrote in to object, at length, to the way Didion had disrespected what was obviously his favorite filmmaker. Her reply? “Oh, wow.” ●

438,"Opinion: If the priority with each new variant is to race toward reopening society by offering boosters instead of tackling the root cause, we could face an endless cycle of resurgences.","



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

WASHINGTON — Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader and five-term senator from Nevada, died Tuesday. He was 82.His wife, Landra Reid, said he died surrounded by family following four years of treatment for pancreatic cancer. Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer in May 2018 and had said in 2020 that he was in “complete remission” after experimental treatments. Advertisement  “We are so proud of the legacy he leaves behind both on the national stage and his beloved Nevada,” she said in a statement.His death was immediately heralded by his longtime Senate colleagues.“He’s gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted.Reid, who grew up poor in the tiny mining town of Searchlight, Nevada, worked his way up to the top Democrat in the Senate. A chess master of Senate procedure and political kingmaker in Nevada, Reid retired from Congress in January 2017, but he continued to be involved in politics. In the 2018 midterm elections, Reid hand-selected Democratic candidates for Senate and governor — now-senator Jacky Rosen and current governor Steve Sisolak. Advertisement  With more than 30 years in Congress, Reid has been synonymous with Nevada politics for decades. The international airport in Las Vegas was officially renamed after him just this month.Reid was first elected to the US House in 1983, serving two terms before running for Senate in 1986. Over the next three decades, he rose through the ranks of Democratic leadership, eventually becoming the party’s top leader in the chamber in 2005.For just over a decade, he and Mitch McConnell traded off the titles of majority leader and minority leader as their parties took control of the Senate. The two men had a contentious relationship that was built not solely on antagonism, but also on a grudging respect. They considered each other friends, despite years of bitter legislative battles.As McConnell noted when Reid retired, the two senators had a lot in common, despite their strong political differences, including having similar ambitions growing up. “I wanted to throw fastballs for the Dodgers. Harry wanted to play center field at Fenway. We wound up as managers of two unruly franchises instead,” he joked.
 


Reid compared their relationship to two lawyers — which both were prior to entering Congress — arguing opposite sides of a case. “I want everyone here to know that Mitch McConnell is my friend. ... So everybody go ahead and make up all the stories you want about how we hate each other. Go ahead. But we don't,” he said.Senate AccomplishmentsReid served for 12 years as Democratic leader, one of the longest-serving party leaders in history. In that time, Reid oversaw many deals and failures. Among his personal highlights, he noted his work on suicide prevention, inspired by his own father’s suicide; his push to pass the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn recent executive branch regulations (McConnell later used this to rescind several late–Obama administration actions); and his fight to combat female genital mutilation (though he noted on FGM, “There's a lot more that needs to be done. Our government has done almost nothing.”).But Reid’s biggest legislative victory was passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Not only was the law the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since Medicare and Medicaid, it took a lot of legislative maneuvering to get through Congress, much of it led by Reid and his House counterpart, Nancy Pelosi — particularly after Sen. Ted Kennedy died and was replaced in the middle of the process by Republican Sen. Scott Brown, killing Democrats’ filibuster-proof majority.Reid often spoke of Obamacare as a major legislative achievement, but also a personal one. “It would have been wonderful if we had something like that around to help my family when we were growing up,” he said as he retired in 2017, also noting that his father’s depression played a role in his push for better healthcare. Advertisement  Reid was close with Obama as well and took credit in a CNN interview as the first to suggest to the then–Illinois senator that he should run for president. “I called him into my office and told him he should take a look at it. He was stunned because I was first to suggest it to him,"" Reid told the network. “When he was reelected I got a call saying, ‘As soon as he gets off the stand, he wants to talk to you.’ One of most moving phone calls ever received, he said, ‘You're the reason I'm here.’”""I care about Obama. He changed the world,"" he added.In his farewell address, Reid said that working with the Obama administration as majority leader was a “dream job.”On Tuesday, the former president shared a letter he had written Reid before his death.“You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect,” Obama wrote. “I wouldn't have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn't have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.”
 


Yet perhaps Reid’s most lasting effect on the Senate itself was his decision to invoke the “nuclear option” in November 2013, allowing the Senate to move administration officials and judges forward with a simple majority rather than 60 votes needed at the time for cloture. At the time, Reid argued that lowering the number of votes needed to confirm federal judges and nominations to the executive was necessary to end constant Republican filibusters. (He later told CNN, however, that he was inspired in part by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer telling him that Republicans were mocking him, saying he’d never go through with it.) The gambit worked in some ways; after dropping that bomb in the Senate, Reid pushed Obama’s nominees for lifetime judgeships, leaving the president with 334 successful nominations, roughly as many as former president George W. Bush had gotten through during his presidency.But the nuclear option had its drawbacks as well, and there were critics of Reid’s decision in both parties even at the time. McConnell used that rule change to confirm even controversial members of former president Donald Trump’s cabinet and to jam through lower court judges. And in 2017, as many predicted, McConnell went nuclear himself — lowering the number of votes needed for Supreme Court nominees as well, which allowed Republicans to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the high court.While Reid’s decision to go nuclear laid the groundwork for McConnell’s expansion, some liberals argued Reid was wrong not to expand the rule change to the Supreme Court himself when Republicans refused to confirm Merrick Garland, who Obama had nominated in 2016. On the other side of the argument were Democrats like Schumer, who opposed going nuclear for executive branch nominees and came to regret the rule change after it was applied to Trump’s cabinet.Reid defended the decision, even after Trump was elected, writing in a December 2016 New York Times op-ed that “the rule change has been a victory for those who want to see a functioning, open and transparent Senate.” Advertisement  “I doubt any of us envisioned Donald J. Trump’s becoming the first president to take office under the new rules. But what was fair for President Obama is fair for President Trump,” he wrote.Reid announced in 2016 he would retire, handing the reins over to his longtime mentee, Schumer. Reid told the New York Times at the time, “I want to be able to go out at the top of my game. I don’t want to be a 42-year-old trying to become a designated hitter.”
 


Controversy and Fighting With RepublicansThough he was soft-spoken, Reid could be brash and tough, showing flashes of what drove him as an amateur boxer in his youth during political bouts. He was a constant antagonist of the Republican Party, often skirting the truth to attack the right. Famously, in the 2012 presidential race, Reid claimed in a speech on the Senate floor that Mitt Romney, who released only two years of tax returns, hadn’t paid any taxes in a decade.That was a lie. And even years later, Reid wasn’t sorry about it. When asked if he regretted making the accusation, Reid told CNN in 2016, “Well, Romney didn’t win, did he?” Advertisement  Republican megadonors the Koch brothers were one of Reid’s favorite targets and most hated enemies. He devoted lengthy speeches to the brothers, calling their dark money investments in politics bad for the country and he relished using the line “Republicans are addicted to Koch.” Friends said his fixation on the Kochs was political — he’d later argue no one on the Democratic side was doing enough to counter the Kochs, so he just did it himself — but also personal; he felt very deeply that the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision loosening restrictions on money in politics was doing damage to the country and the Kochs were the biggest symbols of that.But Reid wasn’t as harsh toward Sheldon Adelson, another Republican megadonor who just happened to hail from Nevada. Reid once argued to MSNBC that Adelson, unlike the Kochs, wasn’t “in this for money.” “He’s in it because he has certain ideological views,” he added. “His social views are in keeping with the Democrats on choice, on all kinds of things. So, Sheldon Adelson, don’t pick on him — he’s not in it to make money.”
 


Early LifeBefore entering Congress, Reid’s life was straight out of a movie script. (He even inspired a scene in the movie Casino, which lifts some of Reid’s own lines.) He was born in Searchlight, a tiny town in the desert, and grew up in a house with no indoor plumbing. His father was a miner and his mother was a washer who cleaned clothes for the local casinos and the 13 brothels operating in the town of 250 people at the time, he often recalled. Advertisement  As he grew older, Reid became an amateur boxer and, as he acknowledged later in life, got into plenty of fights outside of the ring as well. In 2018, he was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame both for his own fighting career and for his advocacy for the sport while in the Senate.
 


He graduated college from Utah State University and later got his law degree from George Washington University. While in law school, Reid earned money by serving as a Capitol police officer, guarding the building he would later preside over.Reid’s father killed himself in 1972, a death that informed a lot of his later policymaking. He cited his father’s suicide in his push for increased funding to study depression as well as for suicide prevention efforts, but also in making his case for increased background checks for gun sales, as well as for the Affordable Care Act. Advertisement  In the late 1970s, Reid was appointed as the chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a powerful position where he oversaw the state’s casinos, which had a major mob influence at the time. In 1978, a Las Vegas man named Jack Gordon tried to bribe Reid to approve new gaming machines — an attempt that led to one of the more famous confrontations of Reid’s pre-political career. Reid reported the bribe to the FBI and worked with them on a sting to ensnare Gordon. Much to the surprise of FBI agents, when Reid met with Gordon, he grew increasingly angry and jumped across a table to choke the man, screaming, “You son of a bitch, you tried to bribe me!” before agents pulled him off and arrested Gordon.Three years later, Reid’s wife, Landra, found a car bomb attached to the gas tank of the family’s station wagon. Reid, who wrote about the incident in his autobiography The Good Fight, believed that Gordon was responsible. Gordon had spent six months in prison after the FBI sting Reid arranged but was never officially connected to the car bomb. It’s still unclear who was responsible.In 2015, Reid’s colorful past came back to haunt him in a bizarre conspiracy theory. The Senate Majority Leader had fallen after an exercise band snapped and threw him backward, causing him to break several ribs and injuring his face. He nearly went blind in his right eye and returned to Capitol Hill with a massive bandage over it that he later swapped out for dark sunglasses as he recovered. (Reid and his wife later sued the manufacturer of the exercise band.)But some conservative blogs and right-wing pundits didn’t buy the exercise band story and offered — without evidence — an alternative. One conservative blogger, citing a friend who had visited Las Vegas and asked around, suggested that Reid had been beaten up by the mob for not coming through on some kind of promise. Rush Limbaugh also said Reid looked like he’d been beaten up and said he didn’t believe the exercise band story. Breitbart went so far as to reconstruct Reid’s bathroom in detail from sales photos of the property in an attempt to disprove his story. Advertisement  Reid responded to the conspiracy theories in a CNBC interview, calling them ridiculous and largely blaming Limbaugh. “Why in the world would I come up with some story that I got hurt in my own bathroom with my wife standing there?” he asked.
 


Family LifeReid is survived by his wife, Landra, whom he met in high school and married at the age of 19. He has often described her as his first love and the love of his life. The two have five children and 19 grandchildren.In his tribute to Reid on the Senate floor in honor of his retirement, McConnell spoke at length about Reid’s relationship with his wife. “His idea of the perfect night out is still a quiet night in, with her,” McConnell said. “Landra’s his confidante, his high school sweetheart, his best friend. She’s his everything. And, for a guy who grew up with nothing, that’s something.” Advertisement     Landra had grown up Jewish (though she and Reid later converted to Mormonism), and her father opposed their marriage. At one point, Reid punched his future father-in-law in the face and Landra and Reid ended up eloping, though Reid said her family accepted them over time.In his own farewell speech on the Senate floor, Reid paid tribute to his wife, saying, “She has been the being of my existence, in my personal life and my public life. [Benjamin] Disraeli, the great prime minister, said in 1837: ‘The magic of first love is that it never ends.’ I believe that. She's my first love. It will never end.”Reid, in his speech, also shared the advice he had given to young people asking how to emulate his success. “I didn't make it in life because of my athletic prowess. I didn't make it because of my good looks. I didn't make it because I'm a genius. I made it because I worked hard, and I tell everyone whatever you want to try to do, make sure you're going to work as hard as you can at trying to do what you want to do. And I believe that's a lesson for everyone,” he said.“The little boy from Searchlight has been able to be part of a changing state of Nevada. I'm grateful I've been part of that change.”

John Madden, the Hall of Fame football coach turned broadcasting icon, died unexpectedly on Tuesday, the NFL announced. He was 85.""On behalf of the entire NFL family, we extend our condolences to Virginia, Mike, Joe and their families,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""We all know him as the Hall of Fame coach of the Oakland Raiders and broadcaster who worked for every major network, but more than anything, he was a devoted husband, father and grandfather."" Advertisement     Though Madden was drafted to the Philadelphia Eagles after college, a knee injury prevented him from ever playing professionally. Instead, he pursued degrees in education and used those skills to embark on a successful coaching career.After stints in college football, he was hired by the Oakland Raiders as the linebackers coach in 1967. After two seasons, he became head coach; at just 32 years old, he was the youngest to hold that position in the American Football League.
 


Over 10 seasons, he led the Raiders to win 103 games in the regular season, with just 32 losses and seven ties. They won Super Bowl XI in 1977, part of a 17-game winning streak that was just shy of what was then the NFL record for consecutive wins.As remarkable as his coaching career was, Madden had perhaps even more of an impact in media. In 1979, he joined CBS as a color commentator and would go on to become the first sports broadcaster to work for all of the major networks.He appeared on radio, in ads, and even in a couple of movies. But his work in video games was revolutionary. The first Madden NFL game debuted in 1988 and spawned a bestselling cultural juggernaut estimated to have sold at least 250 million copies. When he was first approached, Madden thought the format might have potential as a coaching tool, ESPN reported, and his expertise became the foundation of gameplay that mimicked real football.After all, football is what Madden was about.""Football is what I am. I didn’t go into it to make a living or because I enjoyed it. There is much more to it than just enjoying it. I am totally consumed by football, totally involved,"" he once said. ""I’m not into gardening … or any other hobbies. I don’t fish or hunt. I’m in football.”

441,Death tolls from extreme weather events are largely undercounted. It's hurting our ability to prevent future casualties.,"


If you think that the pandemic is dragging on forever, prepare yourself for our climate change future. This year felt like one major disaster followed on the heels of another, with heat waves, hurricanes, fires, floods, and freezing weather all contributing to a deadly year — and the death toll has been alarmingly undercounted. Concerns over resources, particularly water, are mounting as drought in the West continues. Action from the government to address climate change remains stalled and limited.We looked back at the year in climate change and the disasters that are getting worse and more frequent as our world is altered by climate-polluting fossil fuels.

442,"A distressed orca was stuck on rocks, so these good samaritans did their best to help ","


On the quiet Monday after the Christmas weekend, the CDC took many people by surprise — experts included — by releasing updated guidance for how long people with COVID-19 should isolate themselves.The new guidance halves the number of days that people should self-isolate after testing positive from 10 to five, followed by an additional five days of wearing a mask when around others. Advertisement     Crucially, the shorter isolation period only applies to people who are asymptomatic, meaning they are not exhibiting any COVID symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or fatigue. People who are still feeling sick, especially with a fever, should continue to isolate themselves.Guidance also changed for people who have been exposed to someone with COVID. Now, in a signal that our understanding of “fully vaccinated” may be changing, only people who have had their booster shot can go without quarantining. A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is recommended following exposure for anyone else: people who are unvaccinated, who got an mRNA vaccine dose more than six months ago without a booster, or who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine more than two months ago without a booster.“I was not aware they were going to do that,” Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA), told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. “But the essence of what they said is that as we get the science better, we have a better sense, even with Omicron, of what the exposure risks are.”Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the changes.“It’s been clear for some time that a one-size-fits-all period for isolation did not fit the period of contagiousness,” Adalja said. “The updated guidance reflects the fact that this is going to be an endemic virus and the disruption of a case can be safely minimized based on the enhanced scientific understanding that has accumulated.” Advertisement     The CDC stressed its new advice was “motivated by science” that demonstrates most transmission of the novel coronavirus occurs within the first few days before symptoms appear and then over the next two to three days.The recommendations “balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses,” agency director Rochelle Walensky said. “These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.”
 


Speaking to CNN on Monday afternoon, Anthony Fauci, the top medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said the new guidance had been discussed for some time and called the changes “very prudent” at this current stage of the pandemic.Like Walensky, Fauci stressed that the recommendations would help the US continue to function as the country faces an unprecedented number of COVID cases in the weeks ahead due to the highly infectious Omicron variant. Advertisement     “With the sheer volume of new cases that we are having and that we expect to continue with Omicron, one of the things we want to be careful of is we don’t have so many people out,” Fauci said.“Obviously, if you have symptoms, you should not be out,” he added, “but if you are asymptomatic and you are infected, we want to get people back to the jobs, particularly those with essential jobs to keep our society running smoothly, so I think that was a very prudent and good choice on the part of the CDC.”The APHA’s Benjamin said these new changes were aimed at avoiding yet more harsh lockdowns. “Without this, we go back to the total closures, which nobody has the stomach for right now,” he said. “The politics for that just aren’t there.”The changes were announced four days after the CDC said asymptomatic medical workers could return to work after seven days if they test negative. That update was made out of concern that hospitals would be hamstrung by staff shortages as the Omicron variant spreads through medical facilities.But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they were confused why the same negative test requirement, even via a rapid antigen test, was not made for the general public to exit isolation.“I think finding ways to shorten isolation time is a great idea — 10 days is very disruptive — but with testing,” said virologist Angela Rasmussen, who called the CDC’s new changes “reckless.” Advertisement     “Seems the CDC is now just letting big corporations suggest policy and they are saying, ‘Let’s go with it,’” she added. “But it’s not the scientists at the CDC. It’s Walensky and her bosses in Washington who are dictating it, I think.”Epidemiologist Michael Mina also said that it was “reckless” to allow people to leave isolation without first testing negative, noting that he would not want to sit next to someone who tested positive five days ago.“I am 100% for getting people to drop isolation early,” Mina wrote on Twitter. “But it was always with a negative test. What the heck are we doing here?”Business leaders have been calling for changes to the isolation time for so-called breakthrough cases (vaccinated people who contract COVID) to minimize disruptions to the economy. Last week, before several thousand flights were canceled around the world partly due to sick crew members, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian asked Walensky to reduce the isolation time to five days for vaccinated people. He said the 10-day requirement “may significantly impact [the airline’s] workforce and operations.” But, according to Reuters, Bastian also said appropriate testing could play a role.When asked Tuesday why a negative test was not made part of the updated guidance, CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund again emphasized that most transmission occurs early in the first five days of a COVID infection. She said that for the purpose of a diagnosis, both PCR and rapid antigen tests were best used early in the course of illness. “Some people may remain positive by PCR test beyond the period of expected infectiousness,” Nordlund said. “The importance of a positive antigen test late in the course of illness is unclear and does not necessarily mean a person can easily spread the virus.”But experts contacted by BuzzFeed News said they suspected the lack of a testing requirement was due to more practical concerns: “You can’t get tested!” Benjamin said. “It would’ve been an interesting component of it, but you can’t get tests. People are lining up for hours to get tests.” Advertisement     “I don’t know who to blame, but what I can say is we need to focus a hell of a lot more on testing, and that’s something we as a nation have not done well in,” he added. “I don’t know what the holdup is.”
 


The Biden administration has said it plans to send half a billion rapid COVID tests to Americans to try to meet the new demand, but those may take weeks to arrive, offering little help to people currently in isolation who may be struggling to get their hands on one.Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, called the new guidelines “quite reasonable” but said that he too would have included a negative test as an exit requirement, as well as a recommendation for everyone to use better-quality masks, such as N95s.“Do I wish they had added testing, better mask guidance, etc?” he wrote on Twitter. “Yup. But still a step in the right direction.”Bob Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News that his preference would have been for the new guidance to only apply to vaccinated people and that negative tests be required on days four and five of the isolation period. But, he said, that could only exist “in a perfect world.” Advertisement     “In the real world, shorting the isolation time is critical if we’re going to keep hospitals, airlines, and other essential services open, given the skyrocketing cases of Omicron,” Wachter said. “A testing requirement would have been impossible to operationalize given the shortage of tests, and a vaccine requirement would have been difficult to enforce.”He added, “I think that the net benefit to society of bringing people back to work on Day 6 — assuming they mask on Days 6-10, as they’re supposed to — will exceed a relatively small number of infections caused by this strategy, particularly since Omicron is proving to be significantly less severe than prior variants.”Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner who now sits on the board of Pfizer, told the Washington Post that the updated CDC guidance marked a new point in the pandemic.“The new guidance reflects a growing reality that we’re going to have to learn to live with COVID as a persistent risk, and can’t let it shut down society,” Gottlieb said.Benjamin said that as the world enters the third year of the pandemic, officials need to meet the moment with clear, calming communications, especially about the extremely low risk COVID poses to people who have had all their recommended vaccines.“We need to come to a consensus — not just as a nation, but as a planet — as to what the new normal looks like,” he said, “and how we live as this matures to a more endemic version.” Advertisement

A key FBI informant in the Michigan kidnapping case has been charged with fraud, adding to the potential complications facing prosecutors in the high-profile domestic terrorism case.The informant, Stephen Robeson, was charged last week in Sauk County, Wisconsin, with defrauding a couple out of an SUV by convincing them to donate it to an anti–child sex trafficking charity that did not exist, according to the criminal complaint. His wife, Kimberly Robeson, was also charged. Both face up to three and a half years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000 if convicted. Advertisement     Robeson, who has multiple felony convictions and lives in Wisconsin, played a central role in building the criminal case against the alleged domestic terrorists accused in October 2020 of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The investigation resulted in six men being charged in federal court with plotting the kidnapping and eight other men in Michigan state court with providing material assistance to terrorism. Court records and interviews reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that Robeson, working at the FBI’s behest, recruited potential targets, organized meetings during which suspects were secretly recorded, and paid expenses for people to attend those events.But just over four months after the takedown, prosecutors made the highly unusual move of indicting their own informant and charging him in federal court with illegally possessing a firearm, a .50-caliber sniper rifle he bought from an acquaintance from church just two weeks before the arrests in Michigan. Robeson eventually pleaded guilty in a deal that offered him time served and two years probation, an unusually light sentence that was far below sentencing guidelines for a recidivist felon.The new criminal accusation against Robeson comes in state court and is not related to his federal gun charge. But like the federal indictment, it makes claims of illegal conduct even as he was still deeply involved in the Michigan probe and under the supervision of FBI handlers. According to the criminal complaint, he convinced a couple to purchase a used 2003 Chevy Tahoe and donate it under false pretenses to an organization he ran called “Race to Unite Races” that “helps combat child sex trafficking in Sauk County.”An investigation by the Sauk County sheriff showed that despite Robeson’s claims to the contrary, the group “has never been registered as tax exempt or a 501c (nonprofit) organization by the IRS.” According to the complaint, the SUV was signed over to Race to Unite Races on Sept. 3, 2020 — nine days before Robeson participated in a nighttime surveillance of Whitmer’s lakeside vacation home. Advertisement     A federal trial in the kidnapping case is scheduled to begin on March 8. Last week, prosecutors confirmed they would not be calling on three FBI agents at the center of the investigation to testify after one was charged with domestic violence and fired, a second was accused of perjury in a prior case, and a third was discovered to have incorporated a security business linked to an online troll.Despite claims by the Justice Department that the issues with the agents were “irrelevant” to the case designed to “distract the jury,” defense attorneys have leaped on them as a part of their strategy to argue that their clients were entrapped by an FBI willing to overlook misbehavior by its own operatives in order to make a case at all costs.Robeson’s criminal activities are likely to figure heavily in that tactic, and defense attorneys have said they hope to call him as a witness during the trial. On Saturday, lawyers for the federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that “government agents and informants concocted, hatched, and pushed this ‘kidnapping plan’ from the beginning.”Robeson has not entered a plea in Sauk County court, records show. Joseph Bugni, an attorney for Robeson who negotiated his plea deal in federal court, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the US attorney’s office in Grand Rapids also declined to comment, citing a government policy not to comment on ongoing criminal matters. The charge was first reported by the Baraboo News Republic. Advertisement     Documents filed in federal court last week by defense attorneys include numerous transcriptions of audio recordings, text messages, and encrypted chats between Robeson, other confidential informants, and defendants in the case, including recordings made on the night of the surveillance. The attorneys claim they show Robeson and another informant were “in charge of planning and organizing"" the event, rather than the defendants. Prosecutors, meanwhile, contend they have evidence showing the men were predisposed to commit the crimes and thus were not entrapped.Other messages and transcriptions highlighted by defense attorneys appear to show that Robeson, while working with the FBI, offered financial support to the targets of the investigation through a charity he controlled. “Its [sic] all tax writeoffs the way we do it for anybody that does it,” a recording allegedly made by Robeson on Sept. 12, 2020, said. “And what we do is we created a 501(3)(c).” In separate recordings, another informant promises defendants credit cards that draw from Robeson’s charity.Robeson has been convicted of numerous crimes in Wisconsin since the early 1980s, including fraud and having sex with a minor. He has been under investigation by the Sauk County sheriff since late October 2020 and was questioned in July, court records show.Under the terms of his bond in the federal case, Robeson is required to notify his probation officer of any contact with law enforcement, but he has failed to do so, according to a filing in federal court last month, putting his plea deal on the gun charge at risk.

The family of a 14-year-old girl who was shot and killed by a stray bullet fired by a Los Angeles Police Department officer while she was in a dressing room said they want justice for their daughter.Valentina Orellana Peralta was killed while shopping with her mother at a North Hollywood Burlington Coat Factory on Thursday, the day before Christmas Eve, when a man armed with what appeared to be a bike lock began attacking customers. Chaos erupted in the store. Employees and witnesses called 911 to report the crime, but due to the panic and confusion inside the store, police arrived on the scene believing that the man was likely carrying a firearm, the LAPD said. When officers arrived, they shot and killed the man, identified by police as Daniel Elena Lopez, 24. Advertisement     However, one of the bullets that officers fired at Elena Lopez pierced the dressing room door where Valentina and her mother were sheltering in place. She died in her mom's arms.""We heard some screams and sat down and hugged and started crying,"" Valentina's mother, Soledad Peralta, said in a statement translated from Spanish to English during a press conference Tuesday. “Valentina went to lock the door to protect us. We started hugging each other tighter. We were praying. I was praying for her, and I believe she was praying for me.""Suddenly, Soledad said, something hit Valentina with a strong enough force to throw her and her daughter to the ground.""I saw white powder coming out of Valentina's body and she began to go through convulsions. Her body went limp. I tried to wake her up by shaking her,"" Soledad said. ""She died in my arms and there was nothing I could do. To see a son or daughter die in your arms is one of the greatest and most profound pains that any human being can imagine."" Advertisement     Soledad said that police did not respond to her screams for help until after her daughter was dead.""When the police finally came, they took me out of the dressing room and left my daughter laying there. I wanted them to help her, but they just left her laying there alone,"" she said.
 


Police Chief Michel R. Moore issued a statement addressing the shooting on Friday in which he promised an extensive investigation.“This chaotic incident resulting in the death of an innocent child is tragic and devastating for everyone involved,"" he said. ""I am profoundly sorry for the loss of this young girl’s life and I know there are no words that can relieve the unimaginable pain for the family.""Moore said the department will conduct a ""thorough, complete and transparent investigation into the circumstances that led up to this tragedy and provide the family and public with as much information as possible."" Advertisement     In addition to the LAPD's review, the California Department of Justice is conducting an independent investigation into the shooting.On Monday night, the LAPD released a 35-minute video of 911 call recordings and edited surveillance and body camera footage of the events leading up to the shooting and its aftermath.Although Valentina cannot be seen in the video, her mother's scream can be heard after the shooting stopped.
 


In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Valentina's aunt Carolina Peralta said that her niece and sister came to California from their home country of Chile approximately six months ago.She said that Valentina's sister was working in a local restaurant and they traveled to the US to visit her. The trip turned into a longer stay, she told the LA Times, and mother and daughter had begun the immigration process in order to live in the country permanently.""Valentina was a shy girl in Chile, but everything was turning out well for her in the US,"" Carolina Peralta said. ""She was catching up with English and being more outgoing. She was happy to be with her older sister."" Advertisement     ""[Soledad] does not understand how this tragedy could have happened just when they had managed to reunite the family,"" she said.During Tuesday's press conference, lawyers for the family did not announce any legal proceedings but said that they were considering all possible options, including a possible civil lawsuit.""We want justice for our angel. Our precious little angel, Valentina,"" Soledad said.Ben Crump, one of the attorneys representing the family, said the family wanted people to know that Valentina was ""beautiful, intelligent, and had the whole world ahead of her.""He also read out loud a statement from her dad, Juan Pablo Orellana Larenas, who had traveled to Los Angeles from Chile. He said his daughter once described the US as ""the safest country in the world.""""It is like my whole heart has been ripped out of my body,"" the father's statement said.

No one is safe. That’s the disturbing lesson of 2021, a year when every corner of the US was pounded by deadly weather disasters.A wicked winter storm descended on the middle of the country in February, bringing subfreezing temperatures to the typically temperate Texas, knocking out power and freezing people to death in their homes. In late June, people and animals were literally cooked to death in the Pacific Northwest, where temperatures shot up so high they rivaled those of California’s Death Valley. An August rainstorm unleashed so much water in a single day that a small Tennessee town turned into a raging river, knocking homes, with people still in them, right off their foundations. A late-summer catastrophic hurricane, wielding strong winds and heavy rains, battered communities from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. And, most recently, a string of rare December tornadoes whipped through communities nationwide, pulverizing anything in their way.
 


“It was a really bad year,” said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. He added, “We said that last year, and the year before, and the year before that. We’ve had a whole lot of bad years in a row for extreme weather.”This year’s devastation wasn’t just the result of random extreme weather. It was the kind of extreme weather that’s playing out in a world that has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) in the past century and a half, an irreversible result of people pumping carbon dioxide, methane, and other dangerous greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.“This climate change stuff is already here,” Wehner continued. “The impacts are here. The sooner we accept that fact, the sooner we can start adapting our society to deal with it.”It’s natural to wonder: Is it only climate change that is making every terrible disaster, well, so terrible and so deadly? The answer is not so straightforward. And, adding to the confusion, the US doesn’t accurately track climate and weather deaths.For example, it’s still not well understood whether climate change is making tornadoes more likely to form and more intense. There’s more research to suggest that climate change is mucking with polar vortex patterns and worsening winter storms, like the one that slammed into Texas this year. Even that is still an open area of scientific debate. Advertisement  But the summer of 2021 is a different story.Climate change undoubtedly made the Pacific Northwest heat wave more extreme and deadlier than it would have been in a cooler world. The science is also robust linking rising temperatures to increasingly rainier events across the US — such as the Tennessee floods and Hurricane Ida — a result of a warmer atmosphere being able to hold more water vapor.These record-setting disasters were not acting alone. They are coupled with government officials, at every level, being woefully unprepared. A lack of air-conditioning in the Pacific Northwest left people unable to cope with the unbearable heat. A combination of outdated flooding maps, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, and unprotected homes left people at risk of fast-moving water.This double whammy has killed people.Among the dead were children, parents, and grandparents. They were sick and they were healthy. Their skin colors were white, Black, and brown. They were homeless and they were in their homes. They were alone and they were with family and friends. They were sheltering in place and they were trying to flee. It’s impossible to pin any of these specific deaths to climate change, but they point toward a terrible trend: The climate crisis is already deadly. Here is a look at some of the stories of people who have died, and what their fates signal about the future.
 


In the days before scorching temperatures arrived in the Pacific Northwest in late June, the National Weather Service kept updating its forecasts with increasingly dire predictions about exactly how hot it could get.On Saturday, June 26, the Portland International Airport recorded 108 degrees, a new all-time high. Temperatures topped 100 degrees across Oregon and Washington that day.Sebastian Francisco Perez, a 38-year-old Guatemalan immigrant who had only arrived in the US earlier in the year, collapsed while working outside at Ernst Nursery & Farms in St. Paul, Oregon. He died that day. At the time, Oregon lacked rules designed to specifically protect outdoor workers from the brutal heat.Sunday was forecast to be hotter, and in many places it was: Seattle hit 104 degrees, Portland’s airport hit 112, and Salem hit 113. In Eugene, temperatures soared to a local record high of 111 degrees, forcing officials to postpone the US Olympic trials for track and field.After enduring two scorching days in their home in northeast Salem without air-conditioning, Vickie Jones recalled thinking Monday, June 28, would be “a little bit cooler.” That’s what the early forecasts had predicted. Advertisement  “It wasn’t. It was hotter yet,” Vickie told BuzzFeed News by phone. “We weren’t ready for that.”That afternoon, Salem reached an all-time record high temperature: a staggering 117 degrees. Earlier in the week, Salem was roughly 30 degrees cooler.Vickie was worrying about her husband of 44 years, Donald, who was napping upstairs in front of a fan. She sent her great-grandchildren to check on him.“You need to come up and see Grandpa right now,” one of the kids yelled. “Something’s wrong.”Vickie found her husband standing in front of the bed, slumped over and unconscious. “His skin was so hot, I could hardly touch him,” she told BuzzFeed News. “I think he got overheated, and it was too late for him to call out because his body started shutting down.” Donald died the next day at the hospital.“He was only 67,” Vickie said. “He wasn’t ill or anything like that. That’s what is hard to grasp.”Based on official reporting of deaths from the extreme heat that persisted for weeks after, this was among the nation’s deadliest heat waves in recent history. Oregon reported at least 96 deaths associated with the event. Washington state officials reported 119 deaths between June 26 and July 2, and an additional 38 heat-related deaths occurring through August.The official numbers don’t tell the full story. The heat wave’s true death toll is likely hundreds higher. According to an excess death analysis conducted by BuzzFeed News, it’s likely that roughly 670 people were killed by the heat in Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3. Advertisement  Days after the heat wave was officially over, temperatures lingered above 90 degrees in Spokane, Washington. Mickey Hardin texted her ex-husband Charles “Chuck” Hardin, a former salesperson for Budweiser, wishing him a happy 4th of July. His reply was the last time she ever heard from him.
 


“The next-door neighbor saw the newspapers were piling up. The truck was in the driveway,” Mickey said. Charles was found on his kitchen floor, water bottle in hand. He had diabetes, meaning he was especially vulnerable to extreme heat. He didn’t have air-conditioning.“It was a sad, sad situation,” Mickey said. “He will truly be missed.”That same week, an international team of 27 scientists reported the results of a quick study deciphering how much climate change played a role in the record-shattering heat. They found the high temperatures were at least 150 times more likely because of the warming planet; without climate change, they concluded, the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible.”
 


“We haven’t really felt how much we have changed the climate already,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist who contributed to the study. This event showed “what it means when your extremes become so much more extreme.”When asked if climate change was to blame for the hundreds who had died during the heat wave, Otto responded: “We haven’t counted exactly how many of these people are the excess deaths because of climate change — but because climate change is playing such a big role, there are many.”Shawn Cosgrove thinks his brother’s death may be one of them. Randall Cosgrove was a certified electrician and carpenter who did odd jobs across the region, Shawn said. Randy, as his family called him, drove to the site of a new job in Wilsonville, planning to sleep in his truck overnight so he could start first thing in the morning.Instead, he died.“That’s probably the hottest it’s ever been in Oregon,” Shawn told BuzzFeed News. He blamed climate change for what happened.“I think it’s pretty obvious,” he said. “He went to sleep and just baked from the inside out.”
 


On Aug. 21, 2021, before dawn, it started to rain in central Tennessee. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency, its highest flood warning, around 9 a.m. A few hours later, the agency’s Nashville office tweeted: “This is a catastrophic flooding situation.” The small town of McEwen was hit by an astonishing 20.73 inches of rain that day, setting a new state record for 24-hour rainfall.Waverly is a town over — and downhill — from McEwen. At some point during the downpour, debris washed into Trace Creek, which runs between the two towns, and obstructed its flow. Then, suddenly, a trestle bridge along the creek, which had been acting as a sort of levee, catastrophically gave away, officials told BuzzFeed News. Although Waverly only got 8 inches of rainfall that Saturday, in a matter of minutes the town went from being wet to being overrun with a mix of rain and runoff water.Kim Kee was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with her husband, Mark, when he said, “Kim, there’s a noise.”Kim got up and immediately identified the source: Water was pouring into the kitchen. She yelled at her mother to wake up and get dressed. Minutes later, the water was at their waists. Then she got hit from behind by a piece of furniture. She recalled the final moments in her house: “The refrigerator was sparking and falling over, the back door and front door blew in, and I was floating downstream.” Advertisement  She floated several blocks before managing to grab on to a tree limb, holding on for about four hours before being rescued and taken to the hospital. “I was black and blue on every part of me,” she said. “On my right breast, my nipple was just hanging off.”
 


That night, while staying with relatives, Kim learned that her 79-year-old mother, who had also been washed away, was alive after holding on to a telephone pole and U-Haul truck hinge for hours. But her husband was still missing. Mark was a knife maker, a collector of rare Japanese blades, and Kim’s everything. “We had the marriage everyone would kill for,” she said. “We were best friends.”The very next morning, Kim got a call to come back to the hospital. “He’s fine,” she recalled thinking. Then she saw the body bag.Reflecting on what went wrong, Kim blamed local officials and a railroad company for not properly managing the waterways. She does not believe in climate change. “I don’t know what’s going to happen from here,” she said. “Do 20 deaths matter?”While in his car, Jeremiah Shawl saw water topping over the road ahead of him. He used to be a first responder and immediately put that training into action. He went home to pick up a boat and set out to find his mother, Robin Shawl, and mother-in-law, Donna Bradley, both of whom had disabilities and lived in adjacent apartments.“I pulled up to my mother and mother-in-law’s front doors with a boat,” he said, and he was “hollering in there to see if they were still in the apartments.”But neither woman was there, and it's still not entirely clear what happened to them. He spent days searching. Their bodies were eventually found a few miles apart from each other.When Shawl heard the news, he thought about his son and how devastating the deaths would be for him. “My mother was my little boy’s world,” he said. “He practically lived there.”What happened in Waverly, he said, was “not natural.” He blamed much of the destruction on poor management of local waterways. “All the creeks are dried up. They are not cleaned up and not properly taken care of.”But another probable factor is climate change, which scientists say is making this kind of deluge more likely.“Because we know a warmer atmosphere has the capacity for greater water vapor availability, there’s just more water vapor available to these storms, whether they are rainstorms, hurricanes, perhaps even blizzards,” said James Marshall Shepherd, the director of the University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program. “And so because of that, we see intense rainfall rates.” Waverly flooded in 2010 and at least once in 2019. This most recent incident was the most damaging and deadliest by far.
 


Just a week later, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 4 storm on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The storm’s fierce winds knocked out power for the entire city of New Orleans, and its strong rains washed out roads and homes. As Ida moved over land, its wind speeds plummeted and it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Still, the heavy rain continued more than 1,000 miles across the US, setting records and killing people up and down the East Coast.“Three-plus inches of rainfall in an hour in New York City — that’s just unheard of,” Shepherd said. In an urban area like New York, all that rain is hitting impervious surfaces, from roads to sidewalks to parking lots, rather than seeping into soils, he explained, “and so you get rapidly rising waters in response.”For the first time ever, the National Weather Service issued flash flood emergency alerts in New York and northeast New Jersey.“The water is coming in right now,” Queens resident Choi Sledge told neighbors in a basement apartment over the phone on Sept. 1, according to an interview with the New York Times. The neighbors were unable to escape, though. Ang Lama, 50, his partner Mingma Sherpa, 48, and their 2-year-old son, Lobsang, all died in their home in Woodside, Queens. A total of 18 people died from the storm in New York, according to the state’s official tally. Many of them died in partially underground apartments that flooded. Advertisement  “It was just too much water,” Robert Echavarria, fire chief in New Jersey’s town of Millburn, told BuzzFeed News.Echavarria’s team rescued more than 100 people. No one died in Millburn, but other towns weren’t so lucky. In total, 33 people died from Ida in New Jersey, making it the state with the storm’s highest fatality count.Shakia Garrett, 33, tried to help her neighbors as the waters started to rise around the Oakwood Plaza apartment complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The act of heroism proved fatal. Shakia died, as well as her neighbors: Jose Torres, 74, Rosa Espinal, 72, and their son Jose Torres, 38.The apartments were close to the Elizabeth River, explained Salaam Ismial, a distant relative of Garrett’s and a local advocate helping the impacted families. “It was catastrophic,” Ismial said, adding that the apartment flooded with more than 8 feet of water within minutes.Garrett and the Torres family tried to seek safety by climbing on top of a desk in the Torres apartment, he explained, but the water came too fast and too high. “Shakia was actually the last person to go,” Ismial said. She was on the phone with a Torres family member during the event, he explained. Suddenly the line went eerily silent. Shakia was gone.Due to the widespread flood damage, the entire apartment complex, home to more than 600 people across hundreds of units, shuttered after the storm. Many of those families are still staying in hotels, motels, and shelters, Ismial said. “The government bureaucracy is failing to find permanent housing for these folks.” Advertisement  
 


The climate crisis will only get worse. So is 2022 destined to be just as destructive and deadly as 2021? It doesn’t have to be. Straightforward steps to increase preparation and shore up infrastructure could mitigate much of the damage. But political willpower, urgent action, and key investments are often sorely lacking.That’s starting to shift in the places where the high stakes of climate change have already been made painfully clear.For Oregon’s Multnomah County, which encompasses the city of Portland and was ground zero for more than half of the state’s heat-related deaths, local officials and scientists are determined to avoid so many deaths in future heat waves.Going into last summer, Vivek Shandas, a Portland State University professor who studies how cities can adapt to climate change, had spent more than a decade sounding the alarm about the growing risk of extreme heat in the region. But he never got much traction with local officials or community groups. This year’s heat wave changed everything. Advertisement     “I’ve somehow become the go-to heat researcher for the region,” Shandas told BuzzFeed News, who described being “underwater with requests” from members of the community and government in July and August to talk about heat risk.Jessica Guernsey, the Multnomah County public health administrator, is one of the people now thinking a lot more about heat. “It was really devastating to know that this is going to be a norm,” she told BuzzFeed News, “and that we’re not we’re not fully positioned to [immediately] take care of every person in our community.”Heat-related deaths are preventable, and the solutions are simple: ensuring people are hydrated and cool, ideally with air-conditioning. But since the region has historically never reached such high temperatures, many people didn’t have air-conditioning at home during the last heat wave. That was true for the Joneses, the Hardins, and even Guernsey.If people aren’t able or willing to get air-conditioning at home, local officials can provide freely available “cooling centers.” The challenge is getting people there.Guernsey and her colleagues did a detailed analysis of everyone who died from the heat in the county. The highest number of deaths were people who were living alone on higher floors of buildings with no air-conditioning.“One of the things that really stands out in the event is the isolation,” she said, explaining that so many people died alone. Going into next summer, property managers and owners will need to communicate this risk to their tenants who fit in this category, and local officials will need to reach out to tenants as well. Or, as Guernsey puts it, “doubling and tripling communication.” Advertisement     Likewise, both state and local officials in New Jersey told BuzzFeed News there’s now a greater awareness about climate change and flooding risks after Ida.“I think it did change the conversation a bit,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. “What hit New Jersey was the remnants of a tropical depression. So basically a really bad thunderstorm destroyed communities and literally washed people away.”
 


This means: “It wasn’t the worst of what we are going to see,” he said. As part of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration, LaTourette said, he’s devising new policies and programs that protect people from repeat and worsening flooding. This includes bolstering stormwater drainage in current and existing developments to incentivizing people to move out of harm’s way.“You know what it takes?” he said. “It takes political courage.”This fall, LaTourette spoke to the residents of Millburn, along with other places, about the state’s Blue Acres program, which offers property buyouts following devastating disasters. But it’s unclear if anyone will apply.“It’s very tough for some of these homeowners,” said Jesse Moehlman, Millburn’s assistant business administrator. “They like the community. They like where they are sending kids to school. It’s weird and difficult to have a conversation around that. They want to live where they live.”Moehlman, like LaTourette, is haunted by the idea of an even worse storm.“In the neighboring Maplewood, there was a resident who died and was sucked into a manhole,” Moehlman said. “All I kept thinking was, as a community, this could have been much worse. More people could have lost their lives.”In contrast, it’s hard to see how the flooding in Waverly, Tennessee, could have been any worse.According to Chris Davis, sheriff of Humphreys County, who was born and raised in Waverly and helped respond to the disaster, some 600 homes were demolished, dozens and dozens of families have already moved away, and he expects it could take a decade for the region to fully recover.“This was a massive, tragic event, nothing like we’ve ever seen,” Davis said.After resisting for decades, Humphreys County finally signed up for the federal flood insurance program in September. This immediately made the county eligible for certain types of funding to help respond to the current disaster and prepare for a future one. This won’t change much in Waverly, though, which was already a part of the federal program. What could have a local impact, though, explained Waverly Mayor W.B. Frazier, is a new floodplain management study commissioned by the US Army Corps of Engineers. “As a result of that study, there’ll be some correction actions, plans, and projects to come out of that,” Frazier told BuzzFeed News.Davis blamed much of the damage from the disaster on a dangerous pileup of debris that blocked a bridge until the water catastrophically poured out elsewhere. “I honestly do not feel like climate change had anything to do with it,” he said, later adding: “This was an act of Mother Nature.”Frazier, a longtime Waverly resident, had a different diagnosis for what happened. “I am a firm believer that our climate is changing on us, and it looks to me, by these flooding events especially, that it's getting more severe.”And since the August floods, he added, “I think there are more believers.” ●

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

There were plenty of predictable new tech things in 2021, like the latest iPhones or laptops. These are some of the weird, fun, or just useful things we tried out and actually recommend — from e-bikes to a cheapo phone stand, guitar pedals, and even a ’70s-style role-playing game.These items were independently selected by staff and except where noted, they spent their own money on it.

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.” Advertisement  To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement  When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

The number of people who die from extreme weather in the US is being alarmingly undercounted. Without accurate knowledge of the true loss of human life, it will be hard to know how to save more people when the next disaster strikes. Families of the uncounted victims will struggle to get benefits, political leaders will not feel the pressure to better prepare, and people will not realize how lethal climate change really is in the US, right now.As global warming brings more intense weather extremes, the need for more reliable data is literally a matter of life and death. Here’s how and why the data is so inaccurate.Take the unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in late June and early July. According to data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Events Database, supposed to be a key US resource on the impacts of extreme weather, only seven people died in Washington state from excessive heat. Advertisement  During this time, emergency services were overwhelmed by calls for help, and coroners later recorded that dozens of people had died from heat-related illnesses; it's absurd to suggest that the death toll was in single figures. Having combed through death certificates, state authorities eventually put the number of people who perished in Washington at 119 between June 26 and July 2. Yet the toll for the state in NOAA’s database remained unchanged (the database was down at the time of publication).Even more troubling is that the state’s toll of 119 is also a massive undercount. This is according to a BuzzFeed News analysis that examines how many more people die after a given event, comparing it to the number predicted from long-term and seasonal trends. This approach, known as an “excess deaths” analysis, is the most comprehensive method for estimating hard-to-tally death counts — it has been used, for instance, to calculate the full global toll from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the Pacific Northwest heat wave, our excess deaths analysis represents the most complete accounting yet. In Washington state, it reveals that the heat wave likely killed more than 440 people there in the week ending July 3. And it suggests that another 230 or so people were killed that same week in Oregon — again more than that state’s list of 96 recorded heat wave deaths.The Pacific Northwest heat wave is just one example of how official sources are failing to account for the full toll from extreme weather. “I think it’s critically important that we know how destructive these events are, both in terms of capital losses and human losses — and we don’t,” John Mutter, an environmental and social scientist at Columbia University who studies the impacts of natural disasters, told BuzzFeed News. “We could be off by a long way.” Experts agree that there is currently no accurate national database accounting for the lives lost to extreme weather. Advertisement  With climate change already increasing the frequency or severity of deadly weather extremes, this official ignorance is a big and growing problem. “It’s extremely important, because you can’t manage something that you don’t measure,” Susan Cutter, who heads the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News.Solving this problem will require an overhaul of how deaths are recorded and sophisticated analytical methods to model the relationships between extreme weather and deaths. Right now, however, that isn’t a top priority for most state and federal agencies. By failing to account for the full toll so they can learn how to reduce it, government officials are missing chances to save hundreds or thousands of people from avoidable deaths, overheated or frozen in their homes or on the streets, or caught up in the chaos of a devastating storm.
 


In the US, the two main official sources of information on deaths related to extreme weather are NOAA’s Storm Event Database and the CDC, which is the main federal agency responsible for mortality statistics. On a global scale, severe weather deaths are tracked in an international database, EM-DAT, which covers a wide range of disasters from earthquakes to transport accidents, and is the World Meteorological Organization’s go-to source for information on deaths from weather and climate extremes.

This chart, derived from NOAA’s Storm Events Database, EM-DAT, and underlying causes of death recorded by the CDC from death certificates, shows how each source gives a different picture of the annual death toll in the US from extreme weather.“We have a problem here,” Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, formerly director of its Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, which runs EM-DAT, told BuzzFeed News. “If the data is misleading, it can bring us a whole lot of grief, because conclusions can be wrong.”Much of the discrepancy in the leading databases arises from differences in their methods for tracking weather-related deaths. NOAA’s Storm Events Database starts from recorded weather events and then assesses the death toll mostly from numbers provided by local officials or reported in the media. EM-DAT takes a similar event-based approach — in its case looking at events in which 10 or more people died, 100 or more people were affected, or where a state of emergency was officially declared.The other leading approach, used by the CDC, is to compile counts from the causes listed on death certificates — possible because the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has a series of codes that relate to extreme weather, including “Exposure to excessive natural heat” and “Victim of flooding.” Advertisement  
 


The CDC’s numbers for extreme weather deaths are much higher. This is mainly due to its more complete accounting for deaths attributed to excessive natural cold or heat, which averaged 733 and 410 per year respectively from 2000 to 2020. Many people die from overheating or cold outside of extreme heat waves or cold snaps, so are missed by event-based methods.But as the system works right now, death certificates are also missing many fatalities from weather extremes. The CDC gets its data from the states, which in turn compile information from local coroners and medical examiners. And how they fill in death certificates is far from standardized.What gets recorded on a death certificate also typically misses the indirect ways in which storms and other severe weather events can kill, including deaths from traffic accidents as people evacuate, electrocution from downed power lines, or heart attacks from overexertion.The NOAA event-based database does try to account for those indirect deaths, as does EM-DAT. But the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather ripple out in ways that are hard to measure. “Displaced elderly people are very vulnerable,” said Mutter. “They lose track of what their medications are.”NOAA’s failure so far to recognize the full extent of what happened in Washington state during the summer heat wave shows how inadequate event-based recording can be. A NOAA spokesperson noted that the CDC “maintains the official government records on cause of death” and said that NOAA’s numbers for an event that happened almost six months ago were still “preliminary.”“The verification process for the heat wave in late June/early July is ongoing,” the NOAA spokesperson said by email.
 


Deaths can also accumulate over much longer periods than are typically considered by officials accounting for the impacts of a storm or other extreme weather. The most extreme example happened in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017. As cremations took place in the wake of the storm without being included in the official death count, nobody familiar with the situation on the ground believed the US territory’s official tally of just 64 deaths.The full toll was revealed only by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in previous years with the much higher numbers over the weeks that followed the storm, as Puerto Rico was hit by widespread power outages and disruptions to its healthcare system. In December 2017, the New York Times estimated that around 1,000 people more than expected had died in the six weeks after Maria made landfall. Finally, Puerto Rico’s governor commissioned a study from George Washington University, which estimated the storm-related death toll out to February 2018, coming up with a figure of 2,975.In reality, none of the official sources are hitting the right numbers. “I tell students and others to never trust a death toll, no matter who is estimating it,” Mutter said.As emergency managers and public health experts try to convince political leaders of the urgency of action to counter climate change and to reduce the impact of the severe weather it is brewing, the data gaps are becoming more pressing. “If you don’t capture the damage, there is no pressure you bring to bear,” Guha-Sapir said.
 


This year has shone a particularly harsh light on the deficiencies in official accounting for the toll from extreme weather. According to state and local counts, the winter storm that hit Texas in February and the Pacific Northwest heat wave were the two deadliest extreme weather events in the US this year — followed by the tornadoes that devastated parts of the South and Midwest over the night of Dec. 10–11 and Hurricane Ida and its remnants.But it took excess deaths analyses to reveal how bad the Texas freeze and Northwest heat wave really were. In May, BuzzFeed News estimated the true toll in Texas in February, which was hundreds more than the official count. Similar to methods used to investigate the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, we trained statistical models on mortality data that the CDC collects from individual states, which were then used to estimate the number of expected deaths in any week in any state. These models were reviewed by three independent experts in excess deaths analysis.We then compared the models’ predictions to the number of deaths that were actually recorded, after subtracting deaths attributed to COVID-19. (The models were trained on data from 2015 to 2019, before the pandemic hit.)In May, when the Texas Department of State Health Services was recording 151 winter storm deaths, we estimated that just over 700 more people than expected had died in Texas during the week of the storm and worst power outages. The state’s tally has since increased to 210. As more death certificate data has been transferred from Texas to the CDC, our analysis now estimates the excess death toll in the week ending Feb. 20 at more than 750. Advertisement  Our estimates for the Pacific Northwest heat wave, which suggest that around 670 people likely died as a result of the excessive heat across Washington and Oregon in the week ending July 3, were calculated in exactly the same way.The BuzzFeed News analysis of these events also underlined the shortcomings of relying on the underlying cause of deaths recorded on death certificates, as the spikes we identified were driven in large part by deaths attributed to causes other than exposure to cold or heat. Instead, many deaths triggered by the Texas freeze and by the heat wave in Washington were recorded as deaths from underlying medical conditions — in particular, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.That makes sense, as people who are already medically vulnerable are more likely to die if exposed to excessive cold or heat. But it means that the CDC’s counts of deaths from extreme weather based on ICD codes are missing an important part of the picture. “Underlying cause is certainly not always going to have the complete information,” Robert Anderson, chief of mortality statistics at the CDC, told BuzzFeed News.In some states and counties, recording deaths is the responsibility of coroners who may have no specialist medical training. What’s needed, experts told BuzzFeed News, is greater standardization in death reporting, including noting additional factors that contributed to someone’s death as well as an underlying cause.

Clearly, more sophisticated approaches are needed to track the true toll of extreme weather and climate change on human lives. “We have to modernize. We have to find new methods,” said Guha-Sapir. That includes excess deaths analysis, she added.Other insights can come from epidemiological studies that examine in detail the relationship between the number of recorded deaths in a given place and time, and extreme weather there.Where that has been done, estimates for deaths associated with extreme heat exceed the numbers recorded by the CDC from death certificates. In April 2020, researchers led by Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, estimated that heat accounted for more than 5,600 deaths per year from 1997 to 2006 across some 300 counties. The area studied covered more than 60% of the US population.A national study of trends in heat deaths published in December 2020 from researchers led by Scott Sheridan, a climatologist at Kent State University in Ohio, used similar methods to show that progress in reducing heat deaths was stalling. This came after decades in decline, possibly due to the widespread adoption of air conditioning and better awareness of the risks. Among men ages 45 to 64 across parts of the South and Southwest, heat death rates were actually increasing.For wildfire smoke, one of the biggest single causes of weather- and climate-related deaths, epidemiological studies provide the only way of counting the dead.Studies that have modeled the long-term effects of breathing air laden with tiny particles from wildfire smoke indicate that thousands of Americans die every year as a result. Given the trend for larger and more intense wildfires driven by climate change, the number is forecast to double by the end of the century, according to a 2018 study from researchers led by Bonne Ford, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. This increasing toll from wildfire smoke is expected to partly offset public health gains from reducing other forms of air pollution. Advertisement  But you won’t find deaths from wildfire smoke listed in any official database. “When people talked about the costs of wildfires, it was all about the cost of fighting fires, damage to property, and direct deaths from the fire,” Ford told BuzzFeed News. “That’s the motivation for why we started doing these studies.”
 


Knowing how many people are dying from extreme weather is only the start. To reduce the toll, you also need to know which groups of the population are most vulnerable, and have a plan to protect them at times when the risks are most severe. In general, the burden falls most heavily on the less wealthy and on racial minorities: A study published in October from the CDC, based on ICD codes from death certificates, found that the death rate from natural disasters for Black people was 1.87 times times higher than for white people, while for Native Americans the rate was 7.34 times higher.The details vary from place to place, however. In Multnomah County, Oregon, which includes the city of Portland, the people hardest hit during this year’s heat wave were older, living alone, on higher floors of buildings, and with no air conditioning, according to the county’s public health director, Jessica Guernsey. Advertisement  But in Maricopa County in Arizona, home to some 4.5 million people who live in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and where almost every day in the summer brings life-threatening heat, the risk profile is very different. There, the typical victim is a man without regular shelter in his 40s or 50s with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Often people die from exposure to heat after overdosing, said David Hondula, who in September was appointed to head the city of Phoenix’s new Heat Response & Mitigation Office. “It’s that story over and over and over again,” Hondula told BuzzFeed News.The Maricopa County Department of Public Health is one of the most thorough in the nation at recording deaths from extreme heat. Yet the toll there has been steadily rising. In 2020, Maricopa County recorded 323 heat-associated deaths, an increase of more than 60% from 2019, and 15 times the number recorded in 2001. If reducing heat mortality is the “barometer for success,” Hondula said, “we are failing.”Given the link between these deaths and substance abuse, Hondula’s office is now considering measures that — without the data at its disposal — might seem unconnected to the dangers of excessive heat. One idea is to equip volunteers with the Phoenix Community Emergency Response Team with Narcan, the emergency treatment for opioid overdoses.
 


If cities and states across the nation are to reduce the death toll from extreme weather, they will need to overhaul their methods for counting the dead, develop better systems to recognize when emergency plans need to be activated, and have a comprehensive approach to reducing the risks for the most vulnerable people.“There’s a whole suite of hazard mitigation that can come into play,” said Cutter. “We need better preparedness. We need better warning systems. We need to do some interventions such as adding more greenery to cities.” The last measure can help reduce the urban heat islands that can turn poorer neighborhoods into death traps in the summer as asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s heat.As the Pacific Northwest heat wave showed, responding to the reality of climate change may mean dealing with events that exceed anything that has come before. Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who studies health risks from climate change, has advocated for “stress testing,” in which local health agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders conduct war game–like exercises to consider how to respond to hypothetical extreme weather outside of their previous experience.But there are formidable structural and political obstacles to overcome. “I’ve never believed numbers from a state agency. They always have reasons to exaggerate or diminish,” Mutter of Columbia University said. When it comes to getting aid from the federal government, states have a vested interest in stressing how hard they were hit by a disaster. But when the death toll is largely due to failures in a state’s own infrastructure or planning, the incentive works the other way. Advertisement     Deaths from extreme cold in Texas in February are a case in point. Several states were hit by the winter storm that swept through the region around Valentine’s Day weekend. But only Texas experienced a large spike in deaths, after its power grid failed. This came a decade after the state had been warned by federal officials that its power infrastructure was vulnerable to cold, after narrowly escaping a similar disaster in 2011.The CDC, meanwhile, has been working with the National Association of Medical Examiners to try and improve the recording of deaths following natural disasters, and has online training materials that encourage coroners, medical examiners, and physicians to take a broader view of what gets recorded as a disaster-related death. But with responsibility for recording deaths lying with local and state authorities, the CDC is limited to an advisory role — it has no direct power to change how deaths are recorded at the local level.
 


And while several federal agencies have offices focusing on climate and health, there has so far been no concerted effort across the US government to better account for the lives lost to extreme weather. “It’s nobody’s responsibility,” Ebi said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is charged with making sure the US is prepared to withstand and respond to major disasters, but has “not really been part of the picture,” Ebi added.“We know that extreme weather is a matter of life or death,” Jaclyn Rothenberg, FEMA’s director of public affairs, told BuzzFeed News by email. “As emergency management continues to evolve to meet the demands of our changing climate, it will continue to necessitate us to become more advanced in the ways we understand and react to extreme weather.”After a year of successive weather disasters, which have exposed both the fragility of US infrastructure and the nation’s inability to count the lives lost, experts say there should be an urgent focus on improving data gathering and acting on that information.Right now, they warn, local, state, and federal agencies are in the dark, flying into a major storm, as climate change threatens an even more hazardous future.“Disasters are windows of opportunity to make change,” Ebi said. But the tragedy is that officials often only start planning for weather extremes after the bodies start piling up. “Until it’s in their face, it tends to not happen.” ●Zahra Hirji contributed reporting for this story.

If any modern scientist can claim to have carried the torch lit by Charles Darwin, it was Edward Osborne Wilson — usually known as ""E.O.""Wilson pioneered the study of biological diversity, adding a theoretical dimension to nature conservation — which had previously seemed more like a moral crusade than a scientific endeavor.  Advertisement     He popularized the term ""sociobiology,"" exploring evolutionary explanations of social behavior. And he turned it all into lucid prose, becoming one of the most effective science communicators of his time.Wilson died on Sunday in Burlington, Massachusetts, according to a statement from the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.Like Darwin, Wilson stirred up a hornet's nest with his evolutionary theories. But in Wilson's case, the most violent attacks against him came not from religious opponents, but from fellow scientists. After the publication of his 1975 book Sociobiology, Wilson was pilloried by the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, who accused him of justifying eugenics, sexism, and rampant capitalism. But Wilson gave as good as he got, and emerged from the battle with his reputation intact. Advertisement     
 


Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929, Wilson might have studied birds or mammals if not for an accident at the age of 7.


After piercing his right eye with a fishing hook, he didn't seek treatment and later had to have the lens removed. The accident left Wilson with poor distance vision, as he recounts in his 1994 autobiography, Naturalist. But his left eye remained sharp, leading him to focus on what he called ""the little things.""  Advertisement     Ants became his life's work — and led to his interest in biodiversity and the evolution of social behavior. As a Harvard fellow in the early 1950s, he traveled to Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific, marveling at the diversity of the ants he observed and speculating on how they could have evolved.Back at Harvard, where he spent his entire career, these thoughts eventually coalesced into The Theory of Island Biogeography, a 1967 book written with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur. Wilson and MacArthur explored how species diverge into new forms on islands, and showed how their risk of extinction is highest if those islands — which can be patches of natural habitat in a human-altered landscape — are small. This idea still dominates the thinking of conservationists, as they strive to expand and connect fragments of remaining habitat to give wildlife a fighting chance of survival.
 


Ants are not only incredibly diverse, but they also boast some of the most complex societies in the animal kingdom.


Ant colonies with thousands of individuals work together to raise the young of a single queen. This had long posed a problem for Darwinian theory: In a natural world dominated by the struggle to survive and reproduce, why would female workers in social insect species have evolved to be sterile? Advertisement     In 1964, the British biologist Bill Hamilton came up with an answer. He argued that evolution is really about the reproduction and survival of genes, rather than individuals. So a gene can spread if it causes behavior that favors copies of itself in an animal's relatives. This ""kin selection"" theory made sense as an explanation for insect societies, because sister ants and bees — thanks to a quirk of their genetics — share 75% of their genes by descent, rather than the usual 50%.Hamilton was a great theorist, but a poor communicator. Wilson packaged the idea for wider consumption and united it with other work explaining the evolution of behavior. The final chapter of Sociobiology briefly discussed these ideas in the context of human society — too briefly, Wilson later admitted.""I should have been more politically careful, by saying this does not imply racism, it does not imply sexism,"" Wilson told the Harvard Gazette in 2011.The chapter enraged left-leaning academics led by his Harvard colleagues Gould and Lewontin, who published a blistering assault in the New York Review of Books invoking the horrors of Nazi Germany. Wilson was aghast, but fought back hard, accusing his critics of misrepresenting his positions. Wilson followed up in 1979 with On Human Nature, which dealt with the evolution of human behavior in more depth, and won the first of his Pulitzer prizes. (The second was for The Ants, published in 1991 with fellow ant guru Bert Hölldobler.) Advertisement     
 


Wilson's interest in human nature also led him to ponder the centrality of religious belief in human societies.


He lost his Baptist faith in his teens, but in his later years tried to find common ground with evangelical Christians in preserving what they view as divine creation and what he called the ""evolutionary epic.""Wilson didn't shy away from conflict. He spent the last few years of his life at odds with many evolutionary biologists after he rejected Hamilton's kin selection theory in a controversial 2010 paper published in Nature. The paper argued that kin selection had little value as a general explanation of sociality, and described insect colonies as ""superorganisms.""This echoed an old idea called ""group selection,"" which argued that social behavior can evolve because it benefits a group of animals, improving their survival over rival groups. In the gene-centric era, this had become a discredited theory. For the author of Sociobiology to embrace it, while rejecting kin selection, stunned his peers.In a subsequent issue of Nature, 137 leading evolutionary biologists signed a letter denouncing Wilson's about-turn. And in a later article in Prospect magazine, Richard Dawkins of Oxford University added: ""For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is — it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero — an act of wanton arrogance.""Arrogance, or supreme intellectual confidence? History, and the relentless struggle between competing scientific ideas, will be the judge.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear.

Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner Advertisement  
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

453,"The CDC’s updated isolation guidance took people by surprise, including some experts.","


As we head into yet another holiday season marked by the uncertainty and dread of an ongoing pandemic, I’ve been trying to count my blessings. None of my loved ones have died of COVID. I have a job, a cozy home, and my health (physical, if not mental 🥴). In the grand scheme of things, I am absurdly lucky.But I also can’t help but reflect upon everything we’ve missed out on these last two years. Most of what I’ve lost — what we have all lost — is time. Precious, precious time. For me, that’s meant time with my fiancé, who’s only just been able to get back into the US from her native England after a year and a half of travel bans. Other families across the country and around the world have been robbed of time with elderly relatives in the last months of their lives, or the first few months or years with loved ones’ newborns.Soon, we’ll all be a couple of years older than we were when this all began, but it doesn’t necessarily feel that way — in part because certain milestones and accomplishments we might have otherwise reached continue to evade us, and might still for years to come. Advertisement  I wondered how other people might be grappling with these kinds of losses, especially because they’re more amorphous than the chilling finality of death. The social scientist Pauline Boss calls those unclear and often unacknowledged absences in our lives “ambiguous loss”: the result of “an accumulation of heartbreaks that we cannot always recognize,” as Meg Bernhard put it in a December New York Times profile of the emeritus professor. Boss has recently broadened the scope of her work to “questions of societal bereavement” during this time of “atmospheric grief.”Rose Gulati, a 22-year-old living in Toronto, was one of over a hundred people to respond to a BuzzFeed News survey last month about coping with these ambiguous losses. The pandemic began when she was halfway through her third year in university. Now that Gulati is “single, out of school and studying nothing,” she said she feels “robbed” of the time she lost. “Time at university, time with my friends, time to grow into myself. My transition from vibrant, defiant student to stay-at-home adult happened so quickly that I didn’t have time to grieve what I had lost,” she said. “I don’t go to drag shows or protests anymore. I watch TV to amuse myself and stay up late just to feel like I have something to do. The pandemic took away everything that made life fun and worthwhile.”“In a lot of ways, I’m still 20,” Gulati continued. “In others, I’ve lived through the monotony of life and I’m dead.”Death was a recurrent and troubling theme across multiple respondents’ answers. “I feel like I lost two years of my life and now I’m closer to death!” said Juliana Bruno, a 50-something in southern California who works in academia. Advertisement  “I’ve become acutely aware of my mortality and how my time here is truly limited,” Gulati said. “I’ve tried to make peace with death. All of these things that are supposed to come up with life are coming up for me now, because I feel like I’ve lived my life and I’m done with it. The pandemic has turned life into a passive activity of waiting to die. I’m not really alive, I’m just waiting.”Now that the Omicron variant has plunged much of the world into yet another wave of ambiguity and doubt, Gulati is far from alone when it comes to the sense of living in a perpetual state of limbo.“I feel like it's hard to make plans at all now,” said Christina Marfice, 31, a marketing strategist in Chicago. “Everything feels tenuous all the time, like we're constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've found it's better for my mental health to make no plans at all than to try to plan things and have them be canceled or changed, so I've been living in this indefinite holding pattern since early 2020. It's like life is on pause right now with no indication of when it might start moving forward again.”“Quite honestly, I can't imagine what my life will be like next August, much less five or ten years from now,” said a 22-year-old student in Utah who asked that their name be withheld from this story for privacy. “I've invested too much hope only to be burned. I'm not going to hold stock in the future anymore.”
 


The pandemic has made it rudely clear that none of us are getting any younger.Many of my fellow millennials, as well as Gen Zers, feel like they’re losing or have already lost the best years of their youth — and the promises that those years were supposed to hold.“I feel like I’m on some sort of time limit to have fun, and that I’m failing to meet that goal before time runs out,” said Becca Lo Presti, a recent college grad living in Vermont who never imagined spending the glory years of her 20s in a pandemic. “I don’t have the time to be carefree or take adventures. I feel 42, not 22.”“I've moved home and turned 30 while living in my parents’ basement — something that I vowed would never happen,” said Allison Weiner, a marketing coordinator in Rochester, New York. “Now I'm stuck playing family game night instead of playing out my ever-dwindling youth.”“I lost out on so much of my young adulthood,” said Holly Seibold, 24, a fiber artist in Tempe, Arizona. “I thought I would be dating and partying while making friends and putting roots down as I figured out what I want to do long term. I’m currently not doing any of those things.”Dozens of respondents also cited dating and relationships as things they’ve missed out on these last two years.
 


“I feel like the pandemic really hindered my romantic life,” said Michelle Vizzi, a 30-year-old lawyer in New York City. “I broke up with my boyfriend in December 2019 and was just starting to date again when the pandemic hit. I dated a little during the pandemic but I just felt like I lost so much time. And then suddenly I was 30. And do you know what no one warned me about turning 30 as a straight woman? That suddenly the number of likes/matches/etc. you get drops significantly. So many guys have their parameters set to stop at 29. I feel like I lost my last 2 ‘good years’ and now I have so few choices. I always thought that by 30 I would be in a long-term committed relationship and now I'm lucky if I get a match on a dating app. It's really depressing.”“I am looking to settle down, find a life partner, buy a house and stop living with my parents,” said Rachel Lalli, 28, who builds homes in Hanover, Massachusetts. “I have little to no social life and have grown very distant from old college and high school friends. I am now left to wonder how and when I will find my person. Will the world be in a better place?”Dating is one of the first pandemic losses that comes to mind for that 22-year-old student in Utah, where coming out, they said, “is still a dangerous endeavor.” Their university doesn’t have on-campus housing. “I've been living in off-campus apartments approved for BYU-Mormon university, pioneer of electroshock conversion therapy, and home to recent homophobic remarks by church leaders about ‘musket fire’ against queer people,” they said. “I haven't gone on a single date since moving here. I expected by this point in my life to have had at least one serious relationship.”Delays in dating have also meant, for many people, delays in starting a family.“Before the pandemic, I had one friend who had a baby,” said Reaganne Hansford, a 25-year-old speechwriter in Washington, DC. “Now, I have at least 10 friends with babies they had during the pandemic. I don’t know if their timelines were accelerated by the pandemic, but as someone who was NOT ready to have kids 2 years ago (and still don’t feel ready) it has made having kids really heavy on my mind lately. I ask myself if I just don’t want to be left behind by everyone else, but it has made me reevaluate what I want out of the rest of my 20s.”Some people — myself included — are questioning whether to have children at all.“I’ve wanted nothing more than to be a mom my whole life,” Lalli said. “But should I be bringing more people into this messed up world? Is climate change going to end us? Is it going to get so bad as to the point where we are all fighting for our lives again? I know it’s hard to say, so I keep living for a better day.”
 


“I've stopped thinking about possibly having kids someday, because it feels so impossible as a female-identifying person to go through that with American healthcare and laws being how they are,” said Jessica Clair, a 28-year-old living in the DC area. “I also can't imagine bringing a kid into this shitshow — that just feels insanely unfair now.”“2020 was supposed to be the year that my husband and I would start our journey to becoming parents,” said Teresa Martinez, 33, who manages a medical office in southern California. “We had previously put those plans on hold due to familial obligations. His grandma got sick and passed in 2018. My father was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018. It took a toll on us to take on additional responsibilities with our families during this time [and] we made the decision to hold off on trying for a few years to focus on our families.”After getting vaccinated, “we considered trying again,” Martinez said, “but we have seen so much in the last 2 years that it made us really stop to think, do we want to subject a child to this world we live in? Broken healthcare system in the US, broken political system, a capitalistic society in which people of average incomes are unable to afford the cost of living, the rampant racism that exists in this world, etc. Is it responsible to bring a child into this world?”It isn’t only the potential for future families that people have given up on. Many who wrote in noted that they’ve given up relationships with current family members over the past two years because of fundamental disagreements about COVID safety.Rachel Friedrick, a 31-year-old writer in Traverse City, Michigan, had her first child, a daughter, in October 2020. “Aside from their initial visit when she was born, we didn’t see family for the first 6+ months of her life, until the family could get vaccinated,” she said. Some family members understood while the decision to keep loved ones away ruptured other relationships completely. “My husband is a pediatrician and saw Covid patients, so we lived in constant fear that he might bring Covid home to our daughter unknowingly. I struggled through an incredibly isolating maternity leave alone, without friends or family, and then returned to my remote work trying to figure out how to balance working with a baby that refused a bottle and wanted to be fed at the breast every 2 hours. The first 6 months of my daughter’s life were some of the most lonely, isolated, and difficult days of my husband and I’s life.“I feel such loss around the entire experience of becoming a parent,” Friedrick continued. “Memories like my baby’s first Christmas only bring up loneliness and pain, especially because of the family relationships that were broken.”“When you work in healthcare and are seeing people dying daily in the midst of a pandemic, it becomes difficult to maintain relationships with people who are spreading false narratives about the ‘plandemic,’” Martinez said. She lost multiple friends and family members due to COVID-19: some of them died of it, and others got swept up in misinformation. “Even when trying to explain the reality of the situation, people choose to not believe,” she said. “Rather than stress myself out trying to show reality, it was easier to just step away from these relationships and focus on my own mental and physical health.”
 


On the flipside, when the future seems uncertain, we can better appreciate how precious time really is. The pandemic has forced many of us to consider how we want to spend our remaining days — because they are limited, and because they are all we have.For many people, that has meant a radical reconsideration of their relationship with work.“My life is more than half over and I fucking wasted it on stupid beliefs that I had to give 110% to ‘the man,’” said Bruno, the 50-something in southern California. “I should have been doing all that for me — not stupid work that wouldn’t even send flowers if I died tomorrow.”“My professional life, which was for a long time the anchor of my twenties, feels pretty stupid and meaningless in the context of pandemic remote work,” said Taylor Broadfoot, 30, who works at a marijuana tech startup in Seattle.For Clair, the pandemic “really reaffirmed that I don't want work to be a core part of my identity,” she said. “I never had huge career aspirations but this has made it even more clear that working 60+ hours a week in a salary position is just not worth it.”“I lost my entire identity,” said Dani Steeves, a 33-year-old event manager in Ontario, Canada. “I didn't realize how intertwined I as a person had become with my job. I lost friends who I had worked with for a decade because at a time when I needed them the most, they were radio silent.” After that, “I am no longer a person who views their future solely in career terms. Now that I have seen I am an expendable asset to a company that I had devoted my life to, my future outlook no longer always involves the career I thought I would never leave.”Without the potential of a career, romance, or parenthood to give us a sense of identity and purpose, what’s left?“In some ways, the pandemic actually helped me become more sure of myself and make more definitive plans for the future,” said Sydney Spaulding, 23, a writer in San Diego. “When going out all the time wasn't an option anymore, it made me really look at myself in the mirror and try to get to know that person better. In a way, that was a positive change that came out of all this.” Advertisement  
 


Barry F. Keaveney, a 75-year-old semi-retired photographer in rural Arizona, is focusing on “finding satisfaction in home alone time: watching better movies, better cooking, updating computer knowledge.” He thinks we’re facing “a dark future with the Covid pandemic, polarized politics, QAnon and Trump haters and liars, real climate threats and a failed Congress to deal with these problems.” He’s coping with the ambiguous losses of the past couple years by “making up for lost time.” That means “going around with my new cameras, taking photos, considering getting back to drone videos but with more new and professional gear.”“I used to want to have everything figured out, but now I am more happy in the moment,” said Maria Natola, a 32-year-old high school teacher in Vancouver. “I know what I need to be content and to feel like I am living a full life, and many of the things I thought I ‘needed’ have turned out to be nice extras that don't make or break my life. It's cliche, but I've learned that it truly is the little things, and if the little things don't make you happy, neither will the ‘big’ things.”“I think I lost my tolerance for bullshit during the pandemic,” said Jeane Emily DuBose, a 26-year-old who works in medical research in Chicago. “I kind of decided that I'm not going to be afraid of things anymore. I decided to start writing the book I'd been thinking about for years but never actually put to paper. I quit grad school. I quit my job and found a better one I'm excited about. I started making dumb TikToks about vintage romance novels because it's something I enjoy. I've spent so much time being afraid and I decided that I don't care anymore.”“I need to make full use of my pause to really do what I want to do next year,” said Gulati, the 22-year-old Canadian who’s been reflecting a lot on her mortality. “I have to sit down with myself and figure out what that even is. I can’t be afraid of the future, as tiresome as it is to live it. The future is happening right now, and I want to make the most of it. I don’t want to let the past two years dictate the rest of my life. I tried to ‘live’ this summer — I slept with more men than deserved it and got too many piercings. I want to rediscover what meaning actually means to me and I want to live it. For real, this time.” ●

The CDC is shortening the length of isolation time recommended for people with COVID-19, cutting it from 10 days to five, the organization announced Monday.If a person is asymptomatic at the end of the five days, they may end their isolation. The new recommendations also say they should continue to wear a mask for another five days when around other people. Advertisement     ""The change is motivated by science demonstrating that the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, generally in the 1-2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2-3 days after,"" the CDC explained in a statement.The guidance around quarantining after exposure is also changing. Previously, the CDC said fully vaccinated people did not have to quarantine if exposed to COVID-19. But in their Monday announcement, the organization said that would now only apply to people who have received their booster shot.A five-day quarantine, followed by another five days of mask use, is now recommended following exposure to the virus for anyone who is unvaccinated, more than six months out from their last vaccine dose, or more than two months out from getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine without a booster.If the exposed person is unable to quarantine, it is recommended they wear a mask for 10 days when in the presence of others.But even people who have gotten their booster shot should still exercise caution following exposure to the virus. Though they don’t have to quarantine, the CDC said they should still wear a mask for 10 days following the exposure. Advertisement     Regardless of vaccine status, the CDC recommends people get tested for COVID-19 five days after being exposed.The new recommendations come as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has become the dominant strain in the US.“The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC's director, said in a statement on Monday. ""CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses.""Walensky said the updated guidance should ""ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.""""Prevention is our best option,"" she said. ""Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather.”

If any modern scientist can claim to have carried the torch lit by Charles Darwin, it was Edward Osborne Wilson — usually known as ""E.O.""Wilson pioneered the study of biological diversity, adding a theoretical dimension to nature conservation — which had previously seemed more like a moral crusade than a scientific endeavor.  Advertisement     He popularized the term ""sociobiology,"" exploring evolutionary explanations of social behavior. And he turned it all into lucid prose, becoming one of the most effective science communicators of his time.Wilson died on Sunday in Burlington, Massachusetts, according to a statement from the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.Like Darwin, Wilson stirred up a hornet's nest with his evolutionary theories. But in Wilson's case, the most violent attacks against him came not from religious opponents, but from fellow scientists. After the publication of his 1975 book Sociobiology, Wilson was pilloried by the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, who accused him of justifying eugenics, sexism, and rampant capitalism. But Wilson gave as good as he got, and emerged from the battle with his reputation intact. Advertisement     
 


Born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1929, Wilson might have studied birds or mammals if not for an accident at the age of 7.


After piercing his right eye with a fishing hook, he didn't seek treatment and later had to have the lens removed. The accident left Wilson with poor distance vision, as he recounts in his 1994 autobiography, Naturalist. But his left eye remained sharp, leading him to focus on what he called ""the little things.""  Advertisement     Ants became his life's work — and led to his interest in biodiversity and the evolution of social behavior. As a Harvard fellow in the early 1950s, he traveled to Cuba, Mexico, and the South Pacific, marveling at the diversity of the ants he observed and speculating on how they could have evolved.Back at Harvard, where he spent his entire career, these thoughts eventually coalesced into The Theory of Island Biogeography, a 1967 book written with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur. Wilson and MacArthur explored how species diverge into new forms on islands, and showed how their risk of extinction is highest if those islands — which can be patches of natural habitat in a human-altered landscape — are small. This idea still dominates the thinking of conservationists, as they strive to expand and connect fragments of remaining habitat to give wildlife a fighting chance of survival.
 


Ants are not only incredibly diverse, but they also boast some of the most complex societies in the animal kingdom.


Ant colonies with thousands of individuals work together to raise the young of a single queen. This had long posed a problem for Darwinian theory: In a natural world dominated by the struggle to survive and reproduce, why would female workers in social insect species have evolved to be sterile? Advertisement     In 1964, the British biologist Bill Hamilton came up with an answer. He argued that evolution is really about the reproduction and survival of genes, rather than individuals. So a gene can spread if it causes behavior that favors copies of itself in an animal's relatives. This ""kin selection"" theory made sense as an explanation for insect societies, because sister ants and bees — thanks to a quirk of their genetics — share 75% of their genes by descent, rather than the usual 50%.Hamilton was a great theorist, but a poor communicator. Wilson packaged the idea for wider consumption and united it with other work explaining the evolution of behavior. The final chapter of Sociobiology briefly discussed these ideas in the context of human society — too briefly, Wilson later admitted.""I should have been more politically careful, by saying this does not imply racism, it does not imply sexism,"" Wilson told the Harvard Gazette in 2011.The chapter enraged left-leaning academics led by his Harvard colleagues Gould and Lewontin, who published a blistering assault in the New York Review of Books invoking the horrors of Nazi Germany. Wilson was aghast, but fought back hard, accusing his critics of misrepresenting his positions. Wilson followed up in 1979 with On Human Nature, which dealt with the evolution of human behavior in more depth, and won the first of his Pulitzer prizes. (The second was for The Ants, published in 1991 with fellow ant guru Bert Hölldobler.) Advertisement     
 


Wilson's interest in human nature also led him to ponder the centrality of religious belief in human societies.


He lost his Baptist faith in his teens, but in his later years tried to find common ground with evangelical Christians in preserving what they view as divine creation and what he called the ""evolutionary epic.""Wilson didn't shy away from conflict. He spent the last few years of his life at odds with many evolutionary biologists after he rejected Hamilton's kin selection theory in a controversial 2010 paper published in Nature. The paper argued that kin selection had little value as a general explanation of sociality, and described insect colonies as ""superorganisms.""This echoed an old idea called ""group selection,"" which argued that social behavior can evolve because it benefits a group of animals, improving their survival over rival groups. In the gene-centric era, this had become a discredited theory. For the author of Sociobiology to embrace it, while rejecting kin selection, stunned his peers.In a subsequent issue of Nature, 137 leading evolutionary biologists signed a letter denouncing Wilson's about-turn. And in a later article in Prospect magazine, Richard Dawkins of Oxford University added: ""For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is — it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero — an act of wanton arrogance.""Arrogance, or supreme intellectual confidence? History, and the relentless struggle between competing scientific ideas, will be the judge.

Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just…. Piglets — we full-throatedly endorse these.Most of these life hacks are free, but just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them.

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again. I sleep much better at night knowing I’m covered for its full value if something were to happen to it. —Derek Gardner Advertisement  
 


Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

A UK newspaper was forced to print an admission that it had violated the rights of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, on Sunday after losing a privacy and copyright infringement lawsuit.The court-mandated apology and an unspecified amount of money in financial reparations mark the end of a multiyear legal battle between Meghan and Associated Newspapers Limited, the parent company of the Mail on Sunday and Mail Online. The duchess sued ANL in October 2019 for violating her privacy and copyright rights after the company published excerpts from a handwritten letter she sent her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in the Mail on Sunday and in a number of stories published on Mail Online. Advertisement     ""Following a hearing on 19-20 January, 2021, and a further hearing on 5 May, 2021, the Court has given judgment for the Duchess of Sussex on her claim for copyright infringement,"" the statement said. ""The Court found that Associated Newspapers infringed her copyright by publishing extracts of her handwritten letters to her father in the Mail on Sunday and on Mail Online. Financial remedies have been agreed.""On Feb. 11, High Court Lord Justice Mark Warby ruled in Meghan's favor in a summary judgment, a type of verdict granted when a judge determines that no trial is needed because the evidence is so overwhelming. In his decision, Warby wrote that “there is no prospect that a different judgment would be reached after a trial.""ANL's lawyers appealed the ruling, claiming that Warby was wrong to award Meghan victory via summary judgment and arguing for the right to present their case at trial — something the duchess has fought against from the beginning of the proceedings.""To permit the defense to go to trial would only have facilitated further invasions of [Meghan's] privacy,"" her lawyers wrote to the UK Court of Appeal in November. Meghan's legal team accused ANL of pushing for a trial because it would give the tabloid company ""the opportunity to profit handsomely from the media circus that would inevitably result."" Advertisement     During the appeal proceedings in November, lawyers for ANL argued that Warby made his judgment without knowing all of the information — and presented new evidence in the form of written testimony from the Sussexes’ former communications secretary Jason Knauf that showed inconsistencies in Meghan's statements to the court about the letter and her expectations of privacy.According to Knauf, Meghan composed the letter knowing that her father might give it to the press. And although Meghan swore under oath that she never coordinated with members of the media to share private information, Knauf provided the court with emails between himself and the duchess discussing what she wanted him to say in a secret briefing with two reporters who were writing what proved to be a very sympathetic biography of the Sussexes. In response to Knauf's revelations, in a witness statement filed Nov. 11, Meghan apologized to the court “for the fact that [she] had not remembered these exchanges"" and swore she “had no intention to mislead the defendant or the court.”However, the fact that Meghan — intentionally or unintentionally — was not entirely truthful ultimately had no effect on the Court of Appeal, which ruled in her favor in a judgment issued Dec. 2.
 


Although ANL said in a post-verdict statement that it was considering appealing the case to the UK Supreme Court, its publication of the apology Sunday signaled that the company has finally admitted defeat.
 


As part of his initial judgment in Meghan's favor in February, Warby ordered ANL to publish a statement in print and online that acknowledged the company violated the duchess's copyright rights. According to UK law, ""Where the court finds that an intellectual property right has been infringed, the court may, at the request of the applicant, order appropriate measures for the dissemination and publication of the judgment to be taken at the expense of the infringer.""As can be seen in an order filed by Warby on March 22, the wording and format of ANL's statement was a source of contention — down to the font size in which the text would be printed and how long the statement would remain on Mail Online's website.The agreed-upon text was published Sunday on the third page of the newspaper, with a statement on the front page directing readers to it.The same text, with links to the court's judgments, is currently on display on Mail Online's homepage and will be for the next week. (Many commentators pointed out that ANL chose to carry out the court order the day after Christmas, a day when few people typically read newspapers.)
 


In a statement issued in response to the Court of Appeal's ruling in her favor on Dec. 2, Meghan said that her win was not just for her but ""for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what's right.""""While this win is precedent setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create.""From day one, I have treated this lawsuit as an important measure of right versus wrong. The defendant has treated it as a game with no rules. The longer they dragged it out, the more they could twist facts and manipulate the public (even during the appeal itself), making a straightforward case extraordinarily convoluted in order to generate more headlines and sell more newspapers — a model that rewards chaos above truth,"" she said.""Because as far removed as it may seem from your personal life, it’s not. Tomorrow it could be you. These harmful practices don’t happen once in a blue moon — they are a daily fail that divide us, and we all deserve better.""

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O.
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well. Advertisement     Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O. Advertisement     
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M. Advertisement     
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin.

West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

Desmond Tutu, the globally revered South African Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate who played a key role in the country’s struggle against apartheid, has died at age 90.He died Sunday in Cape Town, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said. In a statement, the president praised the intellect, compassion, and leadership of the man affectionately known as ""the Arch."" Advertisement     ""From the pavements of resistance in South Africa to the pulpits of the world’s great cathedrals and places of worship, and the prestigious setting of the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, the Arch distinguished himself as a nonsectarian, inclusive champion of universal human rights,"" Ramaphosa said.The popular Tutu, known for his unwaveringly cheerful disposition, became widely regarded as “South Africa’s moral conscience” during his tireless campaign against the country’s apartheid regime during the long years of Nelson Mandela’s incarceration.As the late Mandela himself said, Tutu was “sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid, and seldom without humor.” Tutu received the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent anti-apartheid campaigning in 1984.
 


Tutu was born in the tiny gold-mining town of Klerksdorp in Transvaal — now in South Africa’s North West province. His mother was a cleaner and cook in a school for the blind, and his father was a teacher, a profession he would eventually enter himself.After three years teaching in high school, he became dismayed at the 1953 Bantu Education Act — which enforced racial segregation in all South African educational establishments — and began studying theology.
 


Tutu had been inspired by the church from an early age. He saw the white priest Trevor Huddleston working as parish priest for the Black Johannesburg slum of Sophiatown when he was 12.“One day, I was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in priest’s clothing walked past. As he passed us, he took off his hat to my mother. I couldn’t believe my eyes — a white man who greeted a Black working-class woman!” he said.This first encounter with Huddleston had a lasting effect on Tutu. When asked in his later years about why he doesn’t hate white people, he would usually respond that he was fortunate with the white people he met while he was young.Tutu was ordained as a priest in 1960, and from 1962 to 1966, he continued his theological studies in the United Kingdom, where he received his master’s degree in theology. He returned to South Africa in 1967 and taught theology in his home country until 1972, when he returned to England to serve as the assistant director of a theological institute in London for three years.He became the first Black Anglican dean of Johannesburg in 1975, and then the bishop of the Diocese of Lesotho in 1976.
 


While he was already a powerful figure within the church, it was the 1976 uprising in Soweto and other Black townships — during which hundreds of people were killed — that saw him catapulted into the consciousness of white South Africans as a campaigner for reform.He unflinchingly pushed nonviolent protest as the best means to further the anti-apartheid cause, and his outspoken campaigning inevitably led to his presence being felt more and more in the political arena. Tutu always insisted his motivation was religious rather than political, arguing that the racist apartheid system was against God’s will.In 1984, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Prize for his “role as a unifying leader figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa,” an award that sent a strong message from the international community to P.W. Botha’s regime.He gained further attention for his peaceful methods in 1986 when he intervened in the streets of Duduza after a crowd of angry Black people turned on a man they said was a collaborator with the white-minority regime.The man’s car had been set on fire “to provide his funeral pyre.” Tutu, dressed in his robes after officiating a funeral, confronted the mob, telling them their behavior “undermines the struggle,” the New York Times reported.
 


In 1986, his status grew further when he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town, meaning he became the first Black person to lead the Anglican Church in South Africa.He continued his active anti-apartheid campaign in his new role and declared in March 1988, “We refuse to be treated as the doormat for the government to wipe its jackboots on.”Later in 1988, he put himself at risk of being thrown in jail by publicly calling for a boycott of municipal elections. He welcomed the liberalizing reforms announced by new president F.W. de Klerk when he assumed office the following year, which included a lifting of the ban on the African National Congress and the long-awaited release of Nelson Mandela.
 


Mandela was freed in 1990 after 27 years of incarceration, mostly in the notorious Robben Island Prison, and Tutu stood side by side with him in front of cheering crowds at Cape Town’s City Hall only hours after he had left prison.After the end of apartheid, Mandela became South Africa’s first Black chief executive in 1994, and his administration appointed Tutu chair of South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Despite saying he was “appalled at the evil we have uncovered” at times during his tenure, Tutu modeled the commission on using truth as the foundation for forgiveness, and believed this was central to healing the rifts in South African society: “Without forgiveness, there can be no future for a relationship between individuals or within and between nations,” he said.He retired from his role at the commission in 1998 and shared his experience of reconciliation processes with other post-conflict or divided societies, including Northern Ireland, the Solomon Islands, and Cyprus.
 


He became a founding member of the Elders — a group of senior global leaders, who have included Mandela, Kofi Annan, and Jimmy Carter, working together for the advancement of peace and human rights — in 2007. He chaired the group for six years, stepping down in 2013.As he grew older, Tutu continued to speak out wherever he saw injustice in the world. In 2008, he called on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to step down or be removed by force, saying, “He has destroyed a wonderful country. A country that used to be a bread basket — it has now become a basket case.”
 


He also refused to share a platform with Tony Blair in 2012 because of the Iraq War, saying the “then-leaders of the US and UK fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart.”Tutu also said the Israeli blockades of the Gaza Strip were an “abomination,” and compared the country’s policies toward Palestinians to apartheid.He announced his phased retirement from public life in 2011 at the age of 79.In spite of seeing so much injustice in the world throughout his life, Tutu always maintained a positive outlook and maintained his faith in the good of humanity. In 2014, he said, “Despite all of the ghastliness in the world, human beings are made for goodness. The ones that are held in high regard are not militarily powerful, nor even economically prosperous. They have a commitment to try and make the world a better place.”

463,These are the life hacks that we're *definitely* taking with us into 2022,"


Even though it feels like June was literally yesterday, it’s that time of year again. Many Americans are gearing up for a holiday season that is going to range from slightly untraditional to downright devastating. During this time, some of us might be looking for some comfort — some old-fashioned, otherworldly cheer. Thankfully, Danelle Manthey’s new book, American Christmas, has this in droves.Manthey, a New York–based photographer, picked up her first camera at age 16, but it wasn’t until years later that her interest in photographing fantastical Christmas displays turned into an obsession that would take her around the country — to 12 states — and last over a decade. We spoke to her about her new book and what she thinks Christmas displays will look like this year.For more photo news to get you through the holidays, sign up for our newsletter below.
 


Did you grow up in a ""Christmas"" family?My family celebrated Christmas and had the same fake Christmas tree every year. We didn’t go all out with decorations or decorate the outside of our house, but we loved to drive around my hometown, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, looking at Christmas lights. It was our annual tradition. Every year, the local paper has a map of the local light displays. The streets have clever names, like Candy Cane Lane, Church Lane, and Penguin Lane, and all of the houses on a street are decorated according to the theme.How did you find the first folks that you photographed?The first year I worked on the project, I wrote a note introducing myself and asking to take pictures of people with their light displays. My dad and niece went around to houses in Sioux Falls that they thought were the best and left the note in people’s doors and mailboxes. Some of those people contacted me, and I scheduled appointments to take their photos. Advertisement  What surprised you about people's personal inspiration for these decorations?So many folks have very deeply heartfelt reasons for decorating. For example, memories of childhood are often transformed into big public displays. Many people have charities that they donate to in conjunction with their Christmas lights, and that is really a great way to show the giving aspect of the season instead of the commercialization of Christmas.
 


You call these displays a unique form of American folk art. Could you elaborate on that?First, let's look at the definition of folk art: artistic works, as paintings, sculpture, basketry, and utensils, produced typically in cultural isolation by untrained, often anonymous artists or by artisans of varying degrees of skill and marked by such attributes as highly decorative design, bright, bold colors, flattened perspective, strong forms in simple arrangements, and immediacy of meaning. Advertisement  If we look at this definition alone, I think it clearly shows that decorating would be in this vein. The people that decorate in most situations are untrained as artists and wouldn’t consider themselves to be artists at all. One could certainly call Christmas decorations “highly decorated design with bright, bold colors.” And then we get immediacy of meaning or without and distortions of meaning. I think we can clearly say that there are not any distortions of meaning within these decorations — they are what they are: a celebration of the season. There is no ulterior motivation than to spread joy to the community.When you look at those factors, I think it’s quite clear that this — along with this level of holiday decoration being a VERY American phenomenon — is a form of folk art.
 


Are there any decorators who really stand out?I’m pretty attached to every house and person I photographed, but here are some highlights:Petey from Hammond, Indiana. Hammond is the town that is depicted in the movie A Christmas Story, and they have a leg lamp in the window to pay homage to it.Gil Gerard from Louisiana hand-built a trolley car replica like the one that runs down St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans and a paddle boat that sails the Mississippi River.Deacon Dave in Livermore, California, has amazing decorations both inside and out of his “House of the Dove.” The exterior of his home has a canopy of lights that is incredible to walk underneath. He also has a private chapel on the back of his property.And lastly, the book starts with Jim Mortensen from Windsor, California, who transforms the outside of his house into a gingerbread house by wrapping it in brown plastic with candy cane trim and a large cuckoo clock over the garage.
 


Do you see the displays changing this year, with the pandemic?Some people will not be doing their displays because of the pandemic. But I think there may be more Christmas displays this year because people are longing for this coziness, this togetherness — it seems like this year people will be reaching out to see these kinds of displays more.What was, if anything, something truly interesting about the holiday that you learned over the process of making the book?To me, Christmas has never been my favorite holiday. Always a bit too commercial and centered around gifts. This project was a way for me to take back the holiday and spend it with people who transformed it into a community event that’s about giving.

There are many things that can help you get out of a funk.Exercise. Eating well. Getting enough sleep.Watching 42 cheesy holiday romance movies in a row.OK, I’m exaggerating with that last one.It’s more like 29 in a row.All holiday romance movies have the same formula. You take one pretty, thin, usually white woman with perpetually wavy hair and ever-present makeup (even when she’s just gotten out of bed). Give her a Very Important and Real job in the big city — something like an architect or interior designer or personal shopper or generic executive. Add too many work hours and a boyfriend who won’t commit. Advertisement  Now remove her from the big city and place her in the small town she grew up in but has been too afraid to go back to for emotional reasons — preferably related to the death of a parent, because at least one parent must always be dead.And then here comes the crucial ingredient: one tall, handsome, rugged-but-not-too-rugged man, usually clad in flannel, and almost definitely also white. Give him a sad-but-not-too-sad backstory — again, dead parents are preferable — and perhaps he also lived in the big city once before as well, but he’s grown tired of it and now fully embraces the wholesome charms of a small town life.Throw these two shiny, pretty people together in a meet-cute. Maybe they literally bump into each other or attempt to buy the same Christmas ornament or become competitors in a holiday baking competition. It’s crucial that they hate each other at first, but also that they secretly want to bone each other — or they would, if boning were allowed in the strictly PG-rated world of holiday romance.Keep putting them in cute scenarios like tree-decorating, ice-skating, sleigh-riding, snowman-building, and most of all cookie-baking. The formula is pretty much done when they happen to find themselves underneath the mistletoe, and they kiss, and then there’s a misunderstanding, but it’s cleared up within 10 minutes and we get one more kiss before everyone lives happily ever after and, even more importantly, has a very merry Christmas.
 


I’ve just described the exact plot of literally dozens of holiday romances. Hallmark, Lifetime, and now even Netflix churn them out every year in increasing volumes, always with the same basic plot and varying degrees of quality (by which I mean that there are occasional gems among a plethora of very, very bad movies).Sometimes the formula changes slightly — maybe the pretty white woman has been overlooked for her dream job and the handsome white man helps her get there, or perhaps instead of being blonde, she’s brunette — but the core ingredients are always the same. Even the titles and posters are virtually interchangeable, as though the movies’ designers just spun a giant wheel and picked whatever they landed on.To top it all off, the same pool of 12 stars is used for each movie. Lacey Chabert and Candace Cameron Bure are basically employed full-time by the holiday romance machine at this point.In short, every holiday rom-com is essentially the same.And that’s all part of the magic.
 


Contrary to what my current level of obsession with holiday romances might suggest, two years ago, I had never watched one.Two years ago, I was also in the deepest depression I’d experienced in a long time.It came on like a wave in mid-November. I had felt it creeping in bit by bit before that and had mostly been shoving it away to the back of my mind, pretending it wasn’t there and it wasn’t getting worse.Some days, I couldn’t get up at all.I couldn’t stop crying, except when I just didn’t have the energy to do so. I couldn’t sleep, except when I needed to be awake, and then it took everything I had to keep my eyes open.I couldn’t feel joy. I felt as though I never would again.I don’t remember exactly why or how or when it happened because, well, I was lost in a metaphorical mind fog, but somewhere in the midst of all this, I opened Netflix, which yelled at me the way it does, by blasting a trailer as soon as the app opens. “Watch A Christmas Prince!” it screamed. I guess, it’s not like anything matters, I thought.I hit play, and the weirdest thing happened. The movie was terrible. But it was also wonderful.Within a few minutes, I felt something bubbling in my chest. Something I hadn’t felt in weeks. A small spark of happiness. Soon it had grown enough that it actually burst from me in a smile, which became a laugh. I was actually laughing. Half an hour before that I’d been, to quote Anne Shirley (as I always try to do), in the depths of despair, and now I was laughing. Advertisement  Something about that ridiculous, gloriously silly movie worked a little miracle on me. For 92 minutes, I was happy, or something like it. I momentarily forgot about my worries — that is, they’d dwindled back down to their usual undercurrent churn instead of the tsunami they’d recently become.Naturally, I did the only thing any severely depressed person experiencing a brief reprieve would do. I rewatched A Christmas Prince.And then I rewatched it again.And then I discovered the big, wide, green-and-red-tinged world of holiday romances I’d been missing out on.Christmas Inheritance. Switched for Christmas. The Spirit of Christmas. My Christmas Love. Snowed-Inn Christmas. Snow Bride. Merry Kissmas.I slipped into the increasingly familiar world of each movie with eagerness and enthusiasm, feelings which were in themselves marvels.It’s not like these holiday romances instantly cured my depression. But they did give me hope.Spending that December watching one pair of pretty white people after another fall in love got me through to the new year. It gave me enough energy to begin the work it took to actually get better.
 


Here’s the thing about holiday romances: They are far (FAR) from perfect. They’re relentlessly corny, clichéd, and repetitive. They consistently reinforce outdated notions of what a woman can and should be, taking successful heroines who love their jobs and trapping them back in their hometowns, with Men Who Know Better. They’re aggressively heterosexual and blindingly white. There are exceptions to these problems, of course, but they’re too rare — especially when it comes to diversity.And yet these holiday romances are more popular than ever. Hallmark and Lifetime, the stalwarts of the genre, each started their holiday lineups in October this year. Yes, there were Christmas movies out before Halloween had even happened. And audiences watched them.Netflix, meanwhile — a newcomer in the genre, but one that has made an impact (hello, A Christmas Prince) — waited until Nov. 1 before it dropped its first holiday romance of the season.And it’s not just that the season for holiday romance is becoming longer — there’s also more content. This year, Hallmark produced 20% more Christmas movies than it did in 2017, while Lifetime is putting out four times as many holiday movies this year compared to two years ago. Networks like OWN and Freeform are dipping into the genre and releasing holiday romances of their own. All together, there are nearly 100 (!!) new holiday romances coming out in 2019. This is on top of the hundreds-deep back catalogues that the likes of Hallmark and Lifetime replay relentlessly in between premieres.The genre is a juggernaut that shows no signs of slowing down. The ratings are there. People eat these movies up. Women eat these movies up. Advertisement  
 


Many of my friends are, if not quite as obsessed with these holiday romances as I am, at least a little bit addicted to them. Like me, they’re busy and career-minded. They’re smart and opinionated and proudly feminist. And they enjoy slipping into these time-warped rom-coms as much as I do.The truth is a lot (but definitely not all) of the things that are “wrong” with holiday romances are actually part of the appeal. More diversity is vital, but the other problems — well, they’re actually the reason we turn to holiday romances.Rather than seeing tired clichés, these movies instead hold the promise of tropes we love: the kinds of storytelling devices and visual cues and plot points we’re very familiar with — so familiar that they’re like slipping into a warm, comforting blanket. The specifics of what that blanket looks like depend on the person; I personally go positively wild for anything involving fake dating and moments when the main characters have to share a hotel room (and even better, a bed, though that’s a bit too risqué for many a Hallmark and Lifetime product). The point is, the repetition doesn’t put us off — it’s why we watch.Of course the endings are predictable. That’s the best thing about the whole genre. Going into one of these movies, you know that within the next 90 minutes, two people are going to work through all their problems and fall in love and stay in love and everything will be OK in the end.The world is chaotic and scarier than ever, the news is exhausting, and you can’t even check Twitter for silly memes without being reminded that everything is quite literally on fire. But in the land of holiday romance, the biggest problems our heroines face are whether the gingerbread recipe is going to turn out right (it will) or if she’ll ever find the antique tree topper her grandfather gave her grandmother when they got married (she will).Even the regressiveness of some of the plotlines plays a part in their popularity. Millennial burnout is very real, and so it’s no surprise that the idea of escaping long work hours and hectic city life for less stress, more trees, and a bonus handsome guy or two is appealing. We might not actually want to live that life, but we enjoy indulging in the fantasy for a little while.The holidays are hard. They’re even harder when you’re depressed or anxious or lonely. Holiday romances pick up this uncomfortable truth and flip it around: Characters who find the holidays rough rediscover their joy in them, everyone who is lonely finds a perfect someone to give them comfort and companionship, and negative feelings, when they exist, are soothed away with a cup of hot cocoa and a kiss.The true magic of holiday romances is that they allow us to escape to a place that’s controlled and neat — the opposite of the real world.Which is pretty much the best holiday gift you could ask for. ●

I don’t like Christmas, because I don’t really like anything, so very few Christmas movies actually appeal to me. I was raised by grumpy, cynical Hindus, so we didn’t celebrate much beyond rerouting gifts from Diwali to Christmas Day — but trickier is that the positivity proselytizing in holiday movies has never spoken to me. Even now, Christmas feels like a lonely time, even though I’m perpetually surrounded by people who love this holiday and want me to, I don’t know, pretend I love mulled wine (ah, yes, warm cough syrup, ‘tis the season). Advertisement     So, naturally, A Charlie Brown Christmas is the one holiday movie that speaks to me the most. It’s moody and oddly macabre for children’s programming, and it’s only moderately treacly by the end. Christmas bums me out — this year, in particular, for reasons I don’t think I have to detail in full — so maybe there’s something soothing about seeing Charlie’s pathetic little tree (an allegory for me) or watching Lucy grow infuriated with Schroeder (also me, somehow). Christmas is hard! Why are we even pretending it’s not? At least with the Peanuts gang I don’t have to pretend I’m having a nice time, and I’m not the saddest person in the room.“I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus,” Charlie Brown tells his friend in the movie. “Christmas is coming, but I’m not happy. I don’t feel the way I’m supposed to feel.” Same here, buddy. The holidays are tough for outcasts, but it’s nice when you can find someone — or something — understanding of how you feel. —Scaachi KoulHow to watch: PBS, Apple+
 


One of my favorite pandemic activities has been revisiting films I enjoyed as a kid. I recently rewatched both Home Alone movies. Although they’re essentially the same in terms of plot, the sequel is so earnest — and so filled with the exact kind of merriment I’ve been craving in our year of perpetual sadness — that there were moments that made me genuinely weep. It’s billed as a comedy, and it’s led by the talented Macaulay Culkin, who masterfully nails the precocity of Kevin McCallister (has there ever been a better child actor?!), the kid whose feeling of being an outsider in his own family manifests when they, serendipitously, board two different flights for Christmas vacation, one headed to Miami and the other New York City.Kevin, alone in the big city, makes the most of the holiday that he now must celebrate by himself. There’s scamming; he cleverly uses his father’s credit card to check in at the Plaza Hotel, orders room service, and watches movies that definitely aren’t age-appropriate. There’s New York itself; Kevin soaks up the incredible view atop the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern star as the two bandits who haven’t quite mastered the art of outsmarting a 10-year-old boy are fantastic. The scene where Stern’s Marv is accidentally electrocuted — dangerous? Probably! HILARIOUS? ABSOLUTELY! And the John Williams score is beautiful. A little sappy, maybe, but a reminder that the love of family and friends is ultimately the reason this time of the year is so special. So if you want a massive dose of holiday cheer, get to streaming, ya filthy animal! —Michael BlackmonHow to watch: Disney+
 


There is no movie I’d rather watch while getting drunk on a plane — at any time of year — than The Family Stone. It’s the perfect plane movie, the perfect holiday movie. Just a perfect movie, period.Dermot Mulroney plays Everett, the requisite hard-hearted city dweller who’s returning home to the burbs for the holidays. This year, he’s bringing his girlfriend, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker, iconic as always), whose uptight work obsessiveness and tight bun alienate her from Everett’s upscale bohemian siblings. The more Meredith tries to endear herself to them, the cringier she gets. During an infamous dinner scene, she makes anti-gay comments about Everett’s gay brother, Thad (Tyrone Giordano), and it’s only their other brother, Ben (Luke Wilson, delightful as the Cali stoner), who takes pity on her.I know a lot of people who are turned off by the redemption plotline for this anti-gay loser of a woman — but for me, the scene is so much more about how angry their mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) gets at Meredith for implying there’s anything wrong with her son. (And this movie came out 15 years ago, mind you.) Diane Keaton as the Stone family’s matriarch is what I’m really here for, even more so than absurd romantic switch-ups and zany conflicts. As a lesbian with mommy issues, can you really blame me?? I cry at the end every single time. —Shannon KeatingHow to watch: Hulu, HBO Max
 


There are many iconic lines in this 2003 Christmas movie starring Will Ferrell as a human who grew up among elves in the North Pole and who must journey to New York to find his father. Like when Ferrell’s Buddy the Elf finds out he is not, in fact, a gargantuan elf, and that his father (James Caan) is on the naughty list. He runs through the snow in hysterics, and when his friends, a trio of stop-motion figures, say hello, he screams, “Not now, Arctic Puffin!” Or later, when he’s questioned about why he smiles so much: “I love smiling, smiling’s my favorite,” he says. Or when he answers his father’s business phone at a children’s book publisher with “Buddy the Elf, what’s your favorite color?”The movie, directed by Jon Favreau, is a journey of self-discovery (one that rivals that of any Greek hero) as Buddy goes in search of his father while also trying to spread Christmas cheer. There’s something truly magical about watching Ferrell play an eccentric adult dressed like an elf, creating havoc wherever he goes. Even if we are forced to watch this giant adult baby have a romantic plotline with Zooey Deschanel — who is both horribly miscast and blonde!! — whatever, I’ll take it all just to see Ferrell in yellow tights and an adorable little hat running through the streets of New York screaming “Santa!!!!” and putting discarded, already chewed gum into his mouth, even after Santa advises him that the gum he finds on the street is not “free candy.” —Karolina WaclawiakHow to watch: Hulu, Amazon Prime
 


The British candy-coated romantic comedy, which came out in 2003, is everything a good holiday movie should be: It has an unapologetically asinine plot with protagonists you root for that barrels into a completely unrealistic batshit ending — except you don’t care, because everything works out and makes you ugly-cry.Granted, as with all holiday movies, there are plot holes to navigate. Are there so many storylines in Love Actually that you feel like you’re watching four movies at once? Yes. Could the movie have done without the entirely stupid “Colin Goes to America to Have a Four-Way With British-Starved Women in Milwaukee” storyline? Absolutely. Was I incredibly frustrated that Sarah (Laura Linney) sabotaged a night of hot sex with her work crush, Karl (Rodrigo Santoro), by simply deciding not to tell him what was happening in her personal life? Mmmm, yes.Otherwise, Love Actually checks all the boxes. I know we were supposed to care more about way-too-self-aware Sam (Thomas Sangster) and his crush on his American classmate Joanna (Olivia Olson). But let’s be honest, the romance between Jamie (Colin Firth), who retreats to a French cottage after finding his wife in bed with his brother, and his non-English-speaking Portuguese housekeeper, Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz), is the crown jewel of the plot. Even if you think all the other plotlines suck ass, Jamie’s realization and subsequent journey back to Aurélia makes it all worth it.There are other endearing storylines: The friendship between rock legend Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) and his longtime manager, Joe (Gregor Fisher), is sweeter than you think it’ll be. As is the story of how the relationship between how actor stand-ins John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) develops after they simulate some very awkward sex scenes. Advertisement     But, as is the case with your other stupid holiday favorites, this isn’t a movie where we focus on what “should” have happened. Instead, we give ourselves over to the charm of the film. So stop coming for Love Actually and start enjoying it for what it is: A VERY GOOD HOLIDAY MOVIE. —Jason WellsHow to watch: Netflix, Amazon Prime
 


Unlike Cameron Diaz’s character in The Holiday, I cry all the time. I love a good cry. I love a holiday movie that makes you weep. And if you’re looking for the same, The Holiday should be your go-to.This Nancy Meyers masterpiece is ostensibly about two women, Diaz’s Amanda, an unhappy producer of movie trailers in LA, and Kate Winslet’s Iris, a columnist in England, who swap houses for the holidays — but it’s really about what happens when you surround yourself with people who reflect you back to yourself, and who see you and celebrate you as you’ve always been. You get a contact high when you watch Iris grow from a pushover in love to someone who owns their helpful nature. Her relationship with Eli Wallach’s Arthur, an old-Hollywood legend who finds himself lost in an ever-changing neighborhood and industry, is the kind of wholesomeness 2020 needs in spades. Also somehow this movie makes Jack Black hot???? The Holiday is a perfect hug of a movie — yes for the outrageously hot Jude Law transforming into outrageously hot Dad Mode Jude Law, yes for Winslet screaming in delight while exploring her new digs, yes for the cutest movie children ever captured on film — but most especially yes for the way Meyers commits to screen how these women fall in love with the person they’ve always been, because that’s the most enduring love affair. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudHow to watch: Hulu
 


I’ve always thought of You’ve Got Mail as one of my favorite Christmas movies. A persnickety, contrarian colleague pointed out that since the Meg Ryan–Tom Hanks rom-com partly takes place during the fall, that means it’s not a real “Christmas movie.” So I rewatched and realized why it stands out as a holiday story in my head.It’s technically a movie about an idealistic thirtysomething children’s bookstore owner, Kathleen Kelly (Ryan), being catfished by her online pen pal, big-box superstore owner Joe Fox (Hanks), who pushes her indie shop out of business.The story ends in spring, when (spoiler alert) Ryan and Hanks fall in love — but it’s not about romance or new beginnings. It’s really all about the kind of melancholy that the holidays impose. Writer Nora Ephron drew on the 1940s-era screwball rom-com The Shop Around the Corner for inspiration, and that’s partly why, despite its late-nineties online dating–era update, the movie has a retro sheen and soundtrack that adds to the nostalgia.Tellingly, the story’s most dramatic arc and climax take place during Christmas, as Kelly battles for her store while putting up twinkle lights. The store’s demise happens as Kelly liquidates the books, wrapping them up as holiday gifts. She yearns for her mother amid the loss of her store, which makes sense because the holidays are so much about sitting in one’s feelings about family and relationships.The movie makes us root for Kelly’s Santa Claus–like belief in the magic of childhood (though it also asks us to root for a white lady as a victim of gentrification). Even the antiseptic chemistry between the leads feels sanitized in the family-friendly mode of Hallmark holiday fare. In short, You’ve Got Mail is a movie about the sentimentalities that prop up capitalism, and that’s what Christmas is all about. —Alessa DominguezHow to watch: HBO Max ●

It’s not just you — people are prone to moods during the holidays, and more than half feel some stress and fatigue during the final weeks of the year.“The holiday blues are real,” said Elaine Rodino, a psychologist in private practice in State College, Pennsylvania.Travel, dealing with family, and spending money are among the top reasons some people feel less than jolly over the holidays. It’s typically not clinical depression, Rodino said — more of a malaise or dread over the storybook moments of Christmas: shopping, the family dinner, and opening presents. Advertisement     “If one were to devise an experimental set of circumstances which would test the integrity of an individual’s mood control, one would invent the year-end holiday season,” wrote psychiatrist Jonathan Himmelhoch of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic nearly four decades ago in a report on the holiday blues, calling such feelings a predictable, genuine reaction to the season.“You may find yourself fighting over the remote with a sibling you haven’t seen in a year,” psychologist Pauline Wallin, author of Taming Your Inner Brat: A Guide for Transforming Self-Defeating Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. “Of course it is not about the remote, but power and competition, and the feelings around sibling rivalry.”“Have a plan for dealing with it,” she advised. If you know one relative is going to be a problem, for example, think ahead on how you want to deal with them to feel better about yourself at the end of the holiday, perhaps by watching a movie or spending time with the nieces and nephews instead of joining a family argument.“Emotional detachment is bad for resolving conflicts in close relationships, but for getting through short-term ones, it’s not a bad solution,” she said. Imagine you are watching a movie of people arguing (“or Mike Pence watching the president argue,” she joked) instead of jumping in the middle of the long-running family dispute.“And if you can feel compassion for that grumpy uncle who drives you crazy — he might just be lonely — that’s better than being angry,” she said.

For college students, grades from a just-ended semester are a perpetual worry on returning home for the holidays, since those are often the subject of questions bombarding them when they walk through the door.“There may be concerns about academic performance, about being honest with parents about having a less-than-stellar semester, fears of disappointing family members, not being honest about how things are going,” psychologist Sherry Molock of George Washington University told BuzzFeed News by email.“Some students are discovering who they are (and are not) and are anxious about sharing this info with family,” she said. Sources of stress range from discovering a sexual identity or falling in love with someone who parents might dislike to changing majors. “I am often surprised about how scared students are to tell their parents they are switching to a major that they think their parents will disapprove of,” Molock said.The upside of the holidays is that they end, and with them, seasonal stress for most people. “It’s okay to feel sad,” Wallin said. “I try to tell people that Christmas is just like any other day, it’s only 24 hours, and they can move on to feel a new sense of purpose afterwards.” Advertisement     Although general malaise goes up over the holiday season, psychiatric referrals for suicides actually drop, CDC statistics show, and have for decades. The bulwark of family and friends being around seems to make people less likely to commit suicide.A more worrisome time for people with serious depression comes in the spring, when suicide rates are highest. Mental health experts have written about a “rebound effect” or a “broken-promises effect” among people with clinical depression who soldier through the holidays but commit suicide later, after the joy of the season wears off.If the negative feelings people have in December persist into January or the months afterward, something is more deeply wrong and you really should see someone for help, Rodino said. And if you have trouble getting out of bed months after the holidays, that’s a very bad sign.Although the holiday blues are real for some, more people report feeling happy or festive during the holidays overall. “Christmas isn’t meant to be some sort of mental health challenge,” said Wallin. “People get too caught up in trying to make everything perfect for the holidays.”“I ask kids in January or February what they got for Christmas. They don’t remember. So don’t worry if everything isn’t perfect.”The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org.

Every year during the holiday season, 33-year-old Christina Vineyard and her mom, Chris Caron, looked forward to their favorite tradition of watching Hallmark Christmas movies together. Vineyard, an attorney in Birmingham, Alabama, started watching the popular made-for-TV films because her mom was obsessed with the picturesque, fictional small towns, the Christmas-themed storylines, and the predictable happily-ever-after endings.This is Vineyard’s first Christmas without her mom — both of her parents died in the past year, her dad of a heart attack and her mom of breast cancer — and she hasn’t been able to bring herself to watch a Hallmark Christmas movie from start to finish yet. Advertisement  “It’s just hard, I miss watching them with her,” Vineyard said. “It was just something that we could do together that we bonded over, we always connected over it.”Vineyard and her mom recorded all the same movies on their DVRs, downloaded the Hallmark Movie Checklist app, and had even planned on attending the inaugural Christmas Con in New Jersey this December before they found out how sick Chris was. They loved watching the movies for the same reason millions of people tune in to the Hallmark Channel every holiday season: “It’s just something to watch that’s mindless and doesn’t stress you out.”
 


“It’s not political,” Vineyard added. “It’s something somebody can watch and just be happy about, something that can take your mind off the world for a little bit.”Vineyard posted a version of her story in a private Facebook group called Hallmark Christmas Movies that her mom invited her to join before she died. After sharing with the group, which is more than 22,000 members strong, Vineyard received nearly 500 likes and almost 250 comments. Someone is even sending her a package of goodies they picked up at Christmas Con a couple weeks ago.“At first I thought, Well, I’m kind of being silly posting in this group, but they didn’t make me feel silly. They make you feel like, ‘It’s okay, we’re here to cry with you.’”This Facebook group isn’t just a safe space for dedicated Hallmark fans (also known as Hallmarkies) to post about their obsessions with holiday films. Vineyard’s story about her parents is one of many Hallmarkies have shared about how they lean on Hallmark Christmas movies to heal from surgeries, cope with grief, and feel a sliver of hope and joy in a world that can otherwise seem dark and disheartening.“People need to feel good. They need to feel positive,” said Michelle Vicary, the executive vice president of programming and network publicity for Crown Media Family Networks, which owns the Hallmark Channel. “There’s so much good television that is dark, edgy, and fantastic. But in the huge spectrum of the human experience, things can also turn out okay. Life can be good and life can be positive, and people need that too. That’s where we come in and that’s where our brand comes in and delivers on an emotional experience that says, ‘You know what, things are going to turn out okay, and you’re good and life is good.’”
 


While the Facebook group is representative of a rabid fan base, its 22,000 members are only a tiny portion of the tens of millions of people who tune in to the Hallmark Channel during the holiday season. In 2019, the network has already hit record-breaking numbers since the annual Countdown to Christmas programming kicked off on Oct. 25, with 40 million unduplicated viewers having already watched holiday programming across all of Hallmark’s channels, including Hallmark Drama’s Home for the Holidays and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries’ Miracles of Christmas.People also look to Lifetime’s annual slate of Christmas movies, and other networks, like Freeform and now even Netflix, come out with new holiday movies every year. But the ratings for Hallmark Christmas movies speak for themselves, showing how the channel has cornered the market on holiday romantic dramedies.“We’ve had nearly 10 million people set reminders about upcoming movies on the checklist app, we’ve had 40 million people watch one of our services to date, and we still have so much to go before Christmas,” Vicary told BuzzFeed News. “We had 85 million people watch us last year and we’re already halfway to that before Thanksgiving. That is as mainstream as it gets.”The Hallmark Christmas movie empire has a wide-ranging audience (with most of its viewers being women between the ages of 25 and 54), but when it comes to its onscreen representation, the vast majority of its films lack diversity in race, ethnicity, and sexual identities. The channel has been criticized for its all-straight and mostly white Christmas movie casts; with all of its increasing content over the years, there has never been an LGBTQ couple at the center of a Christmas movie, and non-white characters are few and far between. Advertisement  
 


“We are much like the rest of the industry. We are making strides to correct for that, and we have great movies this year that address diversity,” Vicary said, pointing to Patti LaBelle’s A Family Christmas Gift, A Christmas Miracle starring Tamera Mowry-Housley, and A Christmas Duet with Chaley Rose and Rome Flynn. “I think that there’s still a ways to go, so I would say to our critics, thank you for continuing to come with us on this journey as we correct for that as the industry has.”Loyal viewers look forward to watching their favorite classics and excitedly anticipate new movies starring Hallmark’s “Christmas queens,” like Candace Cameron Bure, Autumn Reeser, and Lacey Chabert, who have built careers and personal brands around their involvement in the films. Hallmark’s Christmas movies have also cemented their place in popular culture with parody sketches on Saturday Night Live, mentions by late-night television hosts, and even a float in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Advertisement  Hallmark feeds this fandom with merchandise, its checklist app, and this year, an inaugural Christmas Con event in New Jersey. It even has its own publishing division.But the movies didn’t become a cornerstone of the Hallmark brand overnight. The G-rated, holiday-themed romantic dramas have grown into a phenomenon because people want an escape from the less idealistic realities of their lives and the world around them, and because Hallmark saw the potential in early viewership numbers.
 


The Hallmark Channel originated in 2001 when it rebranded from the Odyssey Network, a cable channel that aired religious programming. In 2002, it aired its first-ever Christmas movie, Santa Jr. Original holiday movies continued to air through the years, but then the success of The Christmas Card in 2006 prompted the network to consider focusing on holiday programming. “Countdown to Christmas” was born a decade ago and features Christmas movies every weekend from the beginning of November — and now starting at the end of October — until the end of December.The popularity of the films has skyrocketed over the last decade. In 2015, 62 million unduplicated viewers tuned in to Countdown to Christmas, growing to 70 million in 2016 and 72 million in 2017. The rise in viewership inspired an increase in original Christmas movies on the channel. In 2010, there was a jump to 12 original films, and then to 16 in 2015. The following year, Hallmark bumped that number up to 19. Cut to 2019, when the network will air 24 new holiday films. Advertisement  “We can’t give people enough,” Vicary said. “I call it ‘the Hallmark effect’ that we’re having on people right now. When you come to us, you’re going to feel a little bit better about the world and about yourself not just from watching a show, but because of the entire brand experience.”And those are just the numbers for original films. From right before Halloween until New Year’s Eve, the network will show a total of 40 Christmas movies, airing a combination of the 24 new films and fan favorites from past years. Meanwhile, Hallmark is already in production on its slate for 2020 and planning for 2021.“We are Christmas all the time,” Vicary said.
 


While some of the made-for-television films have higher production values than others, they all have similar formats, and they always provide viewers with happy endings. Superfans are rarely surprised by the plots and can often guess what’s coming next for the characters onscreen. And yet, millions of people can’t get enough. These films provide a simple joy to people who want to tune out the rest of the world, especially during the holiday season. Advertisement  Jennifer Johnson, a 42-year-old 911 operator from a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, has been a longtime Hallmarkie and uses the checklist app to keep track of her progress.Johnson’s affinity for the movies even inspired her to compare her life to a Hallmark Christmas movie three years ago, when she took a part-time retail job during the holiday season. While working two jobs to make ends meet and pay off her bills, Johnson said she developed a crush on a coworker. The two ended up falling in love and dating for a couple of years before breaking up and staying friends. It wasn’t necessarily a happily ever after, but Johnson said her real life mirrored the things she loves about Hallmark’s Christmas movies: a bit of joy amid some darkness, all taking place during the Christmas season.“Hallmark Christmas movies always have a strong female character who are never really looking for love, they always have other things going on, but they end up falling in love,” Johnson said. “And I felt like that was me. I felt like I was that strong female working to make ends meet … Hallmark Christmas movies to me are like the modern-day fairy tale.”As a 911 operator, Johnson said her job is incredibly stressful, and at the end of a long day at work, the movies are “absolutely an escape.” Advertisement  “The last thing I want to do is come home and watch a police drama or anything that remotely relates to reality because I get enough of that at work,” Johnson said. “I deal with enough of reality on a day-to-day basis.”

469,We look back at some of the more pleasant moments of 2021,"


This is an excerpt from Please Like Me, BuzzFeed News’ newsletter about how influencers are battling for your attention. You can sign up here.Hey,My name is Ade Onibada, and I’m a social news reporter for BuzzFeed from London. You may have previously read my newsletter hot takes like when I challenged Khloé Kardashian on that viral photo we weren’t allowed to talk about, or more recently, Black TikTok creators taking a stand against the platform in a boycott. Advertisement     Whether it was entertainment, home renovations, beauty tutorials, or restaurant reviews, 2021 was the year that turned TikTok skeptics into believers, as evidenced by the platform reaching 1 billion global users monthly back in September.You only need to scan the hashtag #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, which presently has 7.4 billion views, to see how the app has also influenced our consumer habits (it’s the sole reason I picked up the infamous Kat Von D Good Apple foundation balm).Over on #FoodTok, the cooking community on the platform responsible for introducing national treasures like Tabitha Brown to the world, simple recipes gripped audiences and now TikTok is cashing in.Rather than having to cook a viral food trend themselves, customers will be able to order for delivery from a new venture called TikTok Kitchens, announced this week in Insider. In partnership with Virtual Dining Concepts, the company plans to launch 300 ghost kitchens — the name used for restaurants that exist purely for delivery apps and don’t have storefronts — to bring fans a taste of the dishes creators on the platform popularized.Items including the infamous baked feta pasta, pasta chips, and the smash burger will be available in the first menu, launching in March, and will change quarterly.
 


Like many on TikTok, I saw Amy Wilichowski make pesto eggs — add pesto to a pan, fry eggs in delicious basil-oil-nut paste — so naturally, I too made pesto eggs.The 25-year-old from Boston makes no claims of being the creator of the recipe, but she did say that she was contacted by TikTok and offered $5,000 for her pesto eggs to be included in the new initiative.“I essentially signed a contract saying I was OK with them using my idea as long as I got credited for it,” Wilichowski told Please Like Me. “How it was worded was that a version of my pesto eggs will be included in TikTok Kitchens.”As the company attempts to further cash in on its online dominance with a real-world experience, you have to wonder: Who is going to want to order pesto eggs via a food delivery service about nine months after they were first introduced to the concept?Wilichowski certainly doesn’t know, noting: “That’s not something I would personally want to order on a food delivery app — the yolk is probably cold, it might harden. A sunny-side egg isn’t something you order on Uber Eats.”But she’s expecting TikTok Kitchens to make delivery-friendly pesto eggs, and she thinks her fellow foodies are due to win big, with both money and attention. Advertisement     “I think it’s an amazing idea because I feel like you have all these people who love making food and creating food that are going to get to be in the spotlight with this,” Wilichowski said.The registered dietician and cooking enthusiast dreams of one day owning her own restaurant, and if TikTok is true to its promise, greater things could be on the horizon for creators like her.The company is reported to be putting part of its share of the profits from this venture into supporting creators.In a strange development, when I reached out to TikTok for clarity on which other food content creators had been tapped, a spokesperson called the campaign announcement “premature” and said that things were “still very much in the planning stages.”How the company will unravel the question of who these recipes belong to and if a trending recipe can exist outside of the trending moment is yet to be determined, but I suspect those are the details you figure out when you’re “still very much in the planning stage.”
 


While TikTok is trying to cook us dinner, British journalist Symeon Brown is turning up the heat on the influencer economy in his upcoming book Get Rich or Lie Trying, which I was able to get an advanced copy of since I’m lucky enough to know him IRL.Brown has previously reported on Instagram’s self-styled finance bros, dubbed the “wolves of Instagram,” who routinely promote risky financial products, and use their social media to show off a lavish lifestyle and recruit their unassuming victims.There’s never been a shortage of criticisms of influencers, but a quick search for literature on the broader industry is more likely to turn up suggestions of how you too can become an influencer and transform your basic social media profile into a money-making vehicle while unlocking the girlboss that lies dormant in you.Given that 86% of young Americans reportedly want to become social media influencers, Brown asks the question: “Do they know what they’re letting themselves in for?”Beyond the success stories and household names that have dominated digital culture and carry clout capital, there is a long line of influencers-in-waiting constantly repackaging themselves against a backdrop of financial insecurity and rabid competition.LA YouTube pranksters, OnlyFans creators, dropshippers, the list goes on, and Brown introduces it all while interrogating the dark side of the attention economy.“When the lockdown happened, everyone on my feed was trying to make a buck online,” Brown told me. “My timeline was filled with pyramid schemes, dodgy crypto coins, or friends desperately trying to grow their social media followings to join the growing ranks of digital hustlers.”Money wasn’t the only factor though. “The pivot to influencer is as much about the new capital of internet popularity as it is about pervasive economic precarity,” Brown said. “The book was really trying to tell the story of an ambitious generation who feel shortchanged, disillusioned, and instead of beating the system, believe they have to join it by any means — get rich or lie trying.”Till I can figure out what viral meal I can make to earn a quick $5,000, I’ll meditate this festive season on Brown’s words and wonder how influencers will handle the third year of a global pandemic.Happy holidays,Ade

Tervis insulated tumblers — $34.99 for a four-pack at Amazon2021 was the year I accepted that I needed some kid-friendly plastic drinking glasses for adults. They keep cold drinks cold for an impressively long time — I’ll leave an iced coffee out and find it two hours later with ice cubes still intact. Best of all, the insulation means no condensation sweat to leave rings on wood tables. They’re not the chicest-looking drinkware, but they’re perfect for daily use. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Casio travel alarm clock — $13.95 at AmazonI recently full-on slept through my phone alarm, which was...concerning. Though it did not totally fuck me over on that particular day, it was a wake-up call (lol) that my iPhone cannot be trusted as the sole thing to get me out of bed on time. I purchased a tiny, real alarm clock, and you should, too. It has performed its job of waking me up on time without incident, with the added benefit of not having the very first experience of the day be a blast in the face of the inevitable bad vibes of my phone. Plus, it's cute! —Addy Baird
 


A daily NYT crossword puzzle calendar — $14 at AmazonI refuse to look at my phone’s Screen Time, but I’m sure that in 2020 I spent at least 80% of my waking hours looking at my phone or laptop. I knew it was hurting my eyes and brain, but I struggled during quarantine to find a hobby I enjoyed that took me completely offline. At the end of that year, I bought a crossword puzzle calendar to give myself a daily task (I’m bad at hobbies so hobbies must be tasks) for 2021 that could take anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours to complete. I set myself rules to make it feel even more like an accomplishment (again I am not saying this is the right way to do things): I never google clues, but I can phone a friend. I can’t rip off a day until I’ve finished it (except for the times when I got behind by a week...catching up on that is too much pressure so I just rip seven days off in a chunk like they never happened). The compact page-a-day calendar was easy to take on trips to the woods where my friends would offer to help with the puzzle and then immediately get frustrated that they didn't know which seven-time Emmy winner a clue could possibly be referring to (Ed Asner). Patience is key with crosswords, and the joy of it isn't fun for the whole family, but rather a peaceful, solitary task that doesn't involve looking at my freaking phone. —Sarah Schweppe Advertisement  
 


LoveSac — $1,062–$1317.50 (on sale) at LoveSacA defining image of the pandemic for me is our 60-pound “puppy” cannonballing my unsuspecting daughter as she relaxed in the mountainous LoveSac that now sits, like a befurred and cuddly Jabba the Hutt in our family room. (LoveSac loaned BuzzFeed this item to review.) It’s difficult to describe just how comfortable and how much fun this thing is. Imagine sitting in a bathtub full of fur or a vast kangaroo pouch. Now, imagine doing it with another person. And now add a dog. The big caveat here is that you really need to have a good appreciation for the ridiculous to live with one of the larger LoveSacs as they are Raiders of the Lost Ark boulder–size, but wow, what a wonderful thing to watch movies from. —John Paczkowski
 


The Citizenry linen sheet set — $230 at The CitizenryYears ago when the direct-to-consumer bedding marker first emerged I bought a set of Parachute linen sheets. I remember being thrilled with them at the time, but they lost their color within a year and ripped soon after. So earlier this year we bought some new linen sheets from The Citizenry. I don’t often use the word lovely, but these sheets demand it. They are lovely, deliciously comfortable, and have withstood repeated washings inspired by a strong desire to ALWAYS have them on our bed, which is where I’m writing this because why not? —John Paczkowski
 


Nugget play couch — $259 at NuggetIn fall 2020, I wrote about how hard-to-buy Nugget play couches had become like Supreme drops for moms. The foam couch had grown a cult following through Facebook parent groups as a fun, fort-buildable couch that kids could climb on while doubling as playroom furniture that came in an Instagram-worthy array of colors. The pandemic created a surge in demand and a slowdown in production, resulting in a “drop” system where restocks would sell out within minutes. After publishing my article, I decided to buy one myself.My verdict: It’s absolutely worth the hype. My kid loves climbing and jumping on it, and the best endorsement I can offer any parent is that after an early evening session of Nugget play, he will conk right out at bedtime. Advertisement  There are now plenty of competitors to the Nugget couch, but a lot of them are way more expensive. Though colors are still limited, it’s possible to actually order one now. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Betta fish tank and supplies — tank, $27.99; filters, $8.49; and water conditioner, $2.49 at Amazon; betta fish, ~$5 at your local storeI absolutely did not want a fish. My son had been begging for a fish for months (downgraded from a dog at least), and I relented last January in a moment of pandemic-induced guilt. He couldn't have playdates with real children, but maybe he could have a fish companion. I dreaded cleaning the gross bowl, remembering to feed him, and having to explain his inevitable death to a small child.Turns out I was wrong. I love Swimmy, the blue betta fish. After a short-lived period of my son feeding him a single pellet in the morning and evening, I’ve taken over his feeding duties, and I enjoy it. I talk to Swimmy, greeting him in the morning and evening. I find the light in his tank a helpful nightlight in the kitchen — the one light that stays on, and his tank is even kind of attractive.Best of all, cleaning his tank is easier than I thought it would be. Instead of dumping all the water out weekly, you replace about a third of the tank every three to five days, while the fish stays in the tank (I just scoop it out with a measuring cup). —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Hummingbird feeder — $25 at AmazonHummingbirds are assholes. (OK, just some hummingbirds are assholes. But they’re all adorable!) This I learned after hanging my first-ever hummingbird feeder, daring to hope that it would attract the eponymous visitors. (After being cooped up in a gloomy one-bedroom apartment for a year and a half during the pandemic, we finally moved this summer to a sunny place with a yard.)It didn’t take long — within hours, a colorful lil’ cutie was slurping up nectar (1 part sugar, 4 parts water, easy-peasy) and buzzing around the patio. News spread quickly and a number of their friends popped by — only to be chased away by the aforementioned asshole, who perched near the feeder and spent the whole day scaring off the competition (with a clicking noise we originally thought signaled an electrical problem). I decided I needed another feeder placed far enough away to satisfy other customers.Two feeders became four, four became six. For prime window viewing, I bought a couple of tall shepherd’s hooks. Now we (and our cats) can see the hummingbirds (most of whom are not assholes) from nearly every room in the house. Often when I’m outside replacing a feeder (every four to five days), a hummingbird will buzz around my head like I’m Snow White. Because of these tiny, extraordinary creatures, I experience joy — however fleeting — every single day. Even in 2021!I’ve got Amazon open in another tab, and I’m about to hit “buy now” on my seventh feeder. Can you blame me? —Dru Moorhouse
 


Outward Hound Invincibles stuffingless squeaky dog toy — $14 at AmazonBy the time our new ""puppy"" was 7 months old, he weighed 80 pounds and had probably destroyed his own weight in dog toys. We very quickly lost count of the ""indestructible"" plushies that were disemboweled and drawn and quartered in the one-puppy Battle of Helm's Deep that has been raging in our living room for months now. Only one toy has survived: an Outward Hound Invincibles snake. While he's been desqueaked, brutalized, and used to tow me around in an office chair, Severus Snake, as we call him, endures. He may well be immortal. —John Paczkowski
 


Just fill a sock with catnip, folksThis is Sir Jiggery Pokery, love of my life and the best decision I ever made. He is named after Antonin Scalia’s colorful dissent in King v. Burwell. (Scalia was a hilarious writer, as long as he was in dissent.) But Jiggers, bless him, has no love for cat toys. If it was made for cats, he is not interested in it, because, well, that’s how being a cat works.But he is not impervious to the chemical weaknesses of his kind. At some point during the pandemic, I got a big tub of catnip, took an unmatched sock, shoveled about a cup of the catnip into it, and tied off the top. Jigs promptly took the sock and wrapped it around his head, flailing about in the most feline of highs. Advertisement  Later that evening, he was running around the kitchen diving into empty Whole Foods bags, as one does, and he managed to get the handle of one stuck around his neck. Alarmed, he leapt into the air and ripped the bag in two. He then sprinted across the house, up the stairs, and under the bed, with half the paper bag flying behind him like a superhero cape.Anyway: Get a cat; they are one of life’s great delights. Then get a big tub of catnip and get him real high. —Emily Baker-White
 


Husky workbench as standing desk — $299 at Home DepotAfter 16 months of the pandemic, I figured it would be a good idea to get a desk for my apartment that would not also come with physical therapy for my body. I wanted an adjustable standing desk, but not something that cost $800+ or looked really stupid. I was lucky enough to have been tipped off to a secret: Workbenches sold by Home Depot intended for, I don't know, workbench stuff, actually make for perfect and cheap standing desks. This one is great — it looks fine, it comes on wheels if I need to clear space, it has a cool hand crank that's easy to use. And, best of all, it says “Husky” on it in big letters with a wolf head decal, which makes me feel very powerful while I stare at Tweetdeck. —Matt BermanOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

472,Here are some of the most interesting and powerful photo stories from across the internet.,"



 


When the COVID pandemic first struck, Johanna Daile, a third-year student studying history and psychology at John A. Logan College in Carterville, Illinois, knew they would have trouble concentrating in virtual classes. Having already accumulated $58,000 of debt over three years of college, they decided to temporarily quit school during the pandemic to focus on paying back their loans.But the pandemic continued — and got worse. Daile, then an assistant manager at Dairy Queen, relocated to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to be near family in September 2020. They transferred to another Dairy Queen location, working the same position for less pay. The 24-year-old switched jobs a few more times before finding their current position at Kay Jewelers.Because they did not graduate, Daile wasn’t able to get their loans deferred, and going back to school isn’t possible without taking out even more loans. Their payments are up to $750 per month — over half of their paycheck. They want to resume their education, but the risk of taking on even more debt severely limits their options, Daile told BuzzFeed News. Now their goal is to return to school by 2025, if they are able.Student loan debt is an overwhelming burden shared by over 40 million Americans. It can follow people throughout their lives and lock them out of significant milestones like buying a home or, in Daile’s case, obtaining a degree. Advertisement     Under the CARES Act, student loan repayments were paused, and the federal student loan interest rates were set at 0% as of March 2020. In August this year, a month before the pause was set to expire, President Joe Biden pushed the deadline to resume payments to Jan. 31, 2022.As COVID cases surged this past month, the president on Wednesday announced that he would extend the pause to May 1, 2022. But Biden — who promised on the campaign trail to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower — has not indicated that he will cancel student debt outright, as progressive lawmakers have demanded, a move that would provide immense financial relief to millions of Americans.In his announcement of the extension, Biden acknowledged the difficulties that over 40 million borrowers have faced during the pandemic.“Now, while our jobs recovery is one of the strongest ever — with nearly 6 million jobs added this year, the fewest Americans filing for unemployment in more than 50 years, and overall unemployment at 4.2 percent — we know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” Biden said in his Dec. 22 statement.Biden also promised that the Department of Education would offer support programs in the meantime and to help borrowers make payments come May 2022. But many borrowers told BuzzFeed News the extension doesn’t remotely solve the dire financial issue of $1.7 trillion owed in US student loan debt (including federal and nonfederal loans).“I just wish that it could help those who cannot afford to finish their education and those with private student loans because it was their only choice,” Daile said. “Adults in [the] upper-middle class and upper class can survive, but lower-middle class to low class, we are barely surviving with our payments.” Advertisement     
 


Student loan debt is just not a problem for millennials, according to Alan Collinge, founder of StudentLoanJustice.org, a group that advocates for total cancellation. More than half of all borrowers are over 35 years old, according to Department of Education data from 2020. Older people owe more than younger people, even though they may have borrowed less money initially years ago, Collinge said in the group’s response to Biden’s extension this week.BuzzFeed News reached out to members of the “Student Loan Justice” Facebook group, where borrowers share their stories and support one another. Many of them reacted to Biden administration’s recent extension with deeply personal stories.Kristina Allen, 52, lives near San Francisco and has one more online class to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing from Regis University. She initially took loans out when she began studying to become a registered nurse as her twin daughters attended college. She graduated in 2008.
 


“I was a single mom in poverty, and I desperately wanted my twins and their little sister to have a better life,” Allen said, adding that her three daughters are all college graduates now. “My granddaughter doesn't know what hungry is, so the cycle of poverty stopped.”Over the years, Allen has paid off $90,000 in loans but still owes about $75,000; her initial loan was less than half that amount. Between 2015 and 2016, around her third year of the bachelor’s program at Regis, Allen defaulted on her federal loans and was charged exorbitant interest and fees. She‘s also subjected to a wage garnishment, which means a percentage of her disposable income is being withheld until her loan is paid off or considered not in default. One-quarter of her pretax income has been garnished since 2017 until the first pause in loan repayment came during the Trump administration, she said.Biden’s announcement of a loan repayment extension came as a relief. But once payments restart in the spring, Allen believes she’ll have to “drop her dream” of a master’s degree to focus paying off her loans with the wage garnishment.“Retirement? A home of our own? Not even a thought,” Allen, who said she has lupus and a related blood clot disorder, told BuzzFeed News. The repayment pause has given her a much-needed financial break to afford care for her husband, who has end-stage cancer, as well as address her own health issues she’s neglected. But, Allen said, she can’t afford to move closer to family and friends in New England; she needs her current work-provided health insurance to pay for her husband’s chemotherapy, support herself, and pay the loans.“I'd like to work less and take care of my own health, but I can't, because of my loans,” Allen said.Like Allen, Michael Goolsby, a 56-year-old who works at a Walmart in Fernley, Nevada, said Biden’s new deadline will postpone his wage garnishment; he told BuzzFeed News that, since 2019, 15% of his paycheck has been withheld to pay off his loans. Goolsby has a bachelor’s and master’s in history from Colorado State University; when he finished his master’s in 1991, he had $25,000 in student loan debt.The following year, he was told he faced a default. As a result, his school would not release his transcripts to potential employers, he said. He accepted an offer in early 1994 to consolidate his debt under a Sallie Mae program, which required him to take out a $36,000 loan. But multiple payment deferments and defaults only compounded his debt, causing him to fall behind no matter how much he worked, he said, ultimately leading to a wage garnishment. He said he’s trying to keep other debts down so he can eventually declare bankruptcy.His student loan debt now stands at more than $100,000, he said.“I did many things over time for a job, from driving a truck, managing a fast-food restaurant, working on an assembly line, being a paralegal for a San Francisco law firm for six years, working in IT doing technical support for 15 years, and then driving a cab and leaving California for Reno, Nevada, because that's where the jobs are nowadays as I work towards retirement, which may not even be on my 65th birthday in 2030,” Goolsby said. “But here I am.”
 


Justin Schanck, 43, a teacher in Macon, Georgia, said he owes $80,000 in loans from his combined graduate and undergraduate degrees.“I went to grad school to try and better my life and increase my income, only to add on more loans,” he told BuzzFeed News. Schanck said he blames himself for not thinking about the cost of a graduate degree, “but this predatory lending system certainly did not help.”Not using his hard-earned money to pay off his loans during the pandemic has allowed his family to “reinvest” in his community, he said. They put a new roof on their house to stop a ceiling leak and have been determined to shop from local businesses.“Once the payments start again, that money will essentially be taken away from the local economy,” Schanck said.Yirzely Villanueva, 27, of Canyon Country, California, said she feels both “relieved and stressed'' by the extension. She told BuzzFeed News she has over $40,000 in debt from a master’s degree in teaching from the University of Southern California. She said she’s happy that interest is paused for now and she can pay back “exactly” what she borrowed.“My loan is 60% of my savings and so I'm stuck,” she said. “I either pay off my loan and stay broke, or wait and be in debt indefinitely.”As a Mexican American woman, Villanueva said she feels like the “deck is already stacked” against her when it comes to taking out loans for a home or a car. “With my luck, I'm scared once I hit ‘pay’ [my student loans] will be canceled.”She said the extension makes her wonder why borrowers aren’t being allowed to just pay back their loans without interest.“I feel like I'm just stuck in a horror movie waiting for the ‘interest monster’ to get me,” she said.
 


Like others, Lyndsey Summers, a 31-year-old in Portland, Oregon, said the extension is not enough. “I can’t say I’m unhappy about this extension, but it’s hardly enough for the millions of borrowers suffering,” Summers told BuzzFeed News.She said she owes nearly $75,000 from her bachelor’s degree in communication media from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania. She’s had trouble qualifying for public loan forgiveness and said she “struggles to get by” given her loans and her salary as a journalist. She said it’s been difficult trying to talk to the government and her loan servicer, with long hold times on the phone.“It is the servicer who works with borrowers, and when you ask them for specific information, they point to the school,” Summers said. “The schools don’t have to keep records, by the way, for longer than 5 years — at least according to my institution. I wanted to see an itemized receipt for how my loans were applied to my education. I have no idea if I’ll get an answer. It would have been nice to be notified that records would be destroyed.”Although state schools are “supposed to be more affordable,” Summers pointed out, it wasn’t for her. “I just want to be able to buy a home and get ahead.”Amy (who asked that BuzzFeed News only use her first name for privacy), 55, is a former teacher in Louisiana. She said she originally borrowed $46,000 when she started her undergraduate degree in 1997; after “faithfully” paying off the loans for nearly two decades, she still owes $30,800.
 


“I owe almost as much now as I borrowed, even after 20 years of payments!” Amy told BuzzFeed News. “I have resigned to the fact that I will never in my lifetime be able to pay them off. I will take them to my grave.”Amy said she has applied for teacher forgiveness programs in the past but has always been denied. “I really thought President Biden would follow through with his promises to help Americans such as myself that have been taken advantage of by a predatory loan system,” she said. “It looks like I was wrong.”

If you’ve tried to buy or get a COVID test lately, you may have found long lines, empty shelves, and a frustrating lack of availability in general.This is happening as Omicron is making up the majority of new cases in the country, now about 95% of cases in the US.President Joe Biden recently announced that the US government is buying 500 million at-home COVID tests for the nation.While increased test availability is a good thing, those government-supplied, at-home COVID tests may not be available to request until January and could take months to be distributed. And if you are able to get your hands on rapid COVID tests, a lot of questions remain. How reliable are they? When should you use them? Do they perform differently with Omicron? Advertisement     Here are some important things to know about at-home COVID tests.When should you use rapid COVID tests?Rapid COVID tests are, well, rapidly becoming a way of life in the US. After being absent in the US for much of the pandemic, they are more widely available — and often sold out — in pharmacies and grocery stores as well as online.The pro is that they give fast results — in about 15 minutes, allowing you to make quick changes in behavior if you get a positive result.The con is that they may not be as accurate very early in an infection compared with other tests, like a PCR, that can take a day or more to get results.“Rapid tests are one of the most powerful tools that have not really been utilized in a powerful way in this pandemic,” said longtime testing advocate Dr. Michael Mina, a former Harvard epidemiologist who is now the chief science officer of eMed, a digital platform that facilitates at-home testing. “The government is in a position now where it’s bringing these tests forward, and now is the time to start creating a strategy around how will they be most effectively used,” he said Tuesday at a press briefing.You can take a COVID test for any reason at all, but here are the times the FDA recommends you get tested, even if you have been vaccinated.If you have COVID symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, fever, and other respiratory virus symptomsHave been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed case of COVID for a total of at least 15 minutes. (If you are unvaccinated, get tested right away; if you are fully vaccinated, get tested within five to seven days after exposure, according to the CDC.)If you took part in high-risk activities, including any time you couldn’t socially distance as recommended, such as when traveling, in crowded indoor places, or attending large gatherings or mass eventsMany people who are asymptomatic are now getting screening tests for COVID at work, school, or before or after travel or events.Although vaccines, especially when combined with a booster, are likely to protect against hospitalizations and death due to the Omicron variant, “we know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who were vaccinated,” CDC chief Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others.”Regardless of vaccination status, you should wear a mask in public indoor settings. Walensky encouraged people to take at-home COVID-19 tests before gathering indoors “to help protect you and your family and friends who may be at greater risk of COVID-19 or severe outcomes.”How many different at-home COVID tests are there?There are now (at least) 11 over-the-counter antigen tests, which are the rapid tests that you can buy, take yourself, and generally cost about $20 to $35 for two — if you can find them.An antigen test detects proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can be picked up with a nasal swab.Keep in mind that no test is perfect. Any given medical test is measured by its sensitivity, or how good it is at picking up actual cases and not generating false negatives, and specificity, how good it is at ruling out people who aren’t sick and not generating false positives.Here are some of the at-home antigen tests that have been approved via the FDA’s emergency-use authorization:BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self TestiHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid TestFlowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home TestBD Veritor At-Home COVID-19 TestCareStart COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test/On/Go COVID-19 Antigen SelfTestSCoV-2 Ag Detect Rapid Self-TestInteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid TestCelltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 Ag Home TestQuidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 TestEllume COVID-19 Home TestThere are also over-the-counter molecular tests that are similar to PCR and can detect the virus earlier than an antigen test, but they cost more, Mina said. They include Detect, Cue Health, and Lucira, which can be done at home, as well as other molecular tests that are done in doctor’s offices.“Rapid molecular tests are slightly more sensitive but they are a lot more expensive,” Mina said. There are also fewer of them available. “It’s a much more difficult technology to build than a rapid antigen test,” he said.Are rapid COVID tests accurate and reliable?In general, yes. But you should know that false negatives are more likely to occur early on with rapid tests than with laboratory tests, like PCR.And it’s important to note, a small new study suggests that you can spread the virus in those early days if you are getting a false negative on a rapid antigen test.The study, which is not yet peer reviewed, included test results from 30 people out of hundreds involved in workplace outbreaks in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco in December 2021. The people were fully vaccinated, many with boosters.The research team, led by epidemiologist Blythe Adamson, compared nasal swab rapid antigen tests to saliva-based and nasal-swab-based PCR test results. They found that at least four people had transmitted the virus during the time they had a false negative on a rapid test.While it’s “alarming” that the rapid tests didn’t always detect a high viral load, the study is getting a lot of attention and manufacturers will be working to update their tests, Adamson told BuzzFeed News.“FDA is paying close attention and I think manufacturers are ready to try to adapt and be agile,” she said. “So I think it will move quickly.”False positives are much less common. However, the chances of a false positive can vary by brand, ranging from one in 150 tests to one in 5,000, said Mina.That said, if your rapid test gives a positive result, you should assume you probably have COVID and isolate until you follow up with another type of test, like PCR.Rapid tests are about 30% to 40% less sensitive than PCR tests, and they are more accurate in people with symptoms than without symptoms.In one study, a popular at-home rapid test had a sensitivity of about 35% in asymptomatic people and 64% in people with symptoms when compared with PCR, but was around 100% accurate when it came to people who tested positive for COVID, whether or not they had symptoms. In the study, there were only a handful of false positives, all in asymptomatic people — but 47% were false negatives compared with PCR.These are still good tests! It’s not fair to compare rapid tests you can do at home in 15 minutes to a lab-based result that might be more accurate but takes a day or more (often many more) to get a result, Mina said. You may just need to keep all that in mind when taking a rapid test and know that taking multiple rapid tests is part of the strategy.“The test is very good when it’s positive, but when negative may frequently give you a false negative result,” said Dr. Stanley Weiss, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey.If you get a negative result, follow up with additional rapid tests in a few days to see if it becomes positive, especially if you have reason to believe that you were exposed or infected. Wait at least 24 hours for your next test, according to the CDC, but retesting a few days later can help you feel comfortable that a negative result is a true negative.Mina recommends that if you start having symptoms, assume you have Omicron and self-isolate. Take your first rapid test 24 hours after symptoms start and test again two to three days later.When interpreting and making decisions based on a test result, it’s a good idea to take into account a person’s history of vaccination, mask use, exposures to others, and their general likelihood of actually being COVID positive, Weiss said.Can rapid tests detect the Omicron variant?Yes, that seems to be the case, although the FDA recently announced that rapid antigen tests are less sensitive to Omicron than the Delta variant.It makes sense that a variant might change the reliability of the tests used to detect the virus and the FDA is asking manufacturers to test their products to make sure they work against Omicron and future variants.The FDA has identified a few PCR-based tests that don’t and have recommended that labs don’t use them.If you do have COVID symptoms, can it now take longer for tests to show a positive result than at the beginning of the pandemic?Yes, according to Mina. That’s because early in the pandemic, humans had not been exposed to the virus previously and symptoms — which are a sign the immune system recognizes and is fighting the virus — started later in the timeline of infection.Now that millions of people have either had COVID, been vaccinated, or in some cases both, symptoms generally start sooner. (And it’s clear that you can get COVID two or more times.)“You're going to become symptomatic potentially within a day after exposure because your immune system kicks in so early,” Mina said. He also noted that’s why COVID symptoms have changed and now include congestion and runny nose. “That’s your immunity working,” he said.Is a lateral flow test the same thing as an antigen test?Not exactly. A lateral flow test is a specific type where you dip a piece of paper in a liquid and after a few minutes one line appears — a positive control to show the test is working — and another line appears if the test is positive.While all rapid antigen tests currently on the market for COVID are lateral flow tests, not all lateral flow tests are COVID tests. For example, pregnancy tests also work in this way but use urine rather than a nasal swab for testing.Can a rapid test protect you from getting sick?Not really. Rapid tests are more about protecting other people, not making sure you don’t get the virus. (That’s what vaccines, masks, and social distancing are all about.)However, when people get tested before going to work, a party, school, or traveling, it helps protect everyone. (Although it also helps you get treatment sooner, which is important because almost all effective treatments for COVID are more likely to work the sooner they are started.)Rapid testing is particularly good to help stop superspreaders of the virus, Mina said.“For somebody who’s really spewing out tons of virus and is very likely to infect a lot of people, then the tests are more likely 95% or 98% sensitive for those individuals,” he said.

A 23-year-old woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on Thursday after repeatedly telling her boyfriend to kill himself, which he went on to do, while they were students at Boston College.Inyoung You's guilty plea showed she accepted responsibility that her verbal, physical, and psychological abuse contributed to the suicide of Alexander Urtula, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said. You had originally pleaded not guilty in 2019; under the new plea agreement, she received a suspended sentence. If she violates any of her probation terms over the next 10 years, she could serve two and a half years in jail. Advertisement     Among the terms of the agreement are that she will undergo mental health treatment and do community service. In addition, she may not profit from any portrayal of the case over the next 10 years.“This agreement with defense counsel was made in close consultation with the Urtula family. It is consistent with their desire to seek accountability and closure and to protect the legacy of Alexander, a loving son, brother, and uncle,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a statement. ""They believe this is something Alexander would have wanted.""You's lawyer did not immediately return BuzzFeed News' request for comment.The two began dating in late 2017 or early 2018, BuzzFeed News previously reported. Prosecutors alleged that You became abusive toward Urtula in late summer 2018 after she found out he lied about meeting with his ex-girlfriend. Advertisement     Prosecutors argued that You failed to stop her boyfriend even though she knew where he was and what he was going to do. They argued this made her “criminally responsible” for his suicide.Throughout You and Urtula's 18-month relationship, You sent many abusive texts to Urtula, often telling him to die by suicide.""do everyone a favor and go fucking kill yourself, you’re such a fucking stupid ass worthless shit,"" You texted 22-year-old Urtula, BuzzFeed News reported in 2019.
 


Urtula died on May 20, 2019, just hours before his college graduation. You was tracking his phone that morning and was present at the time of his death. Urtula's family was in town for his graduation.Four days before his death, You texted him, ""FUCK YOU GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELF...""Steven Kim, You’s attorney, said in a statement in November 2019 that prosecutors had branded “an emotionally fragile young woman a monster to the entire world, further traumatizing her.”Before You's arraignment, the Boston Globe published texts between You and Urtula before his death.“ALEX. WHAT SRE YOU [expletive] DOING. IF U [expletive] LOVE ME STOP. IF U EVER [expletive] LOVED ME STOP,"" You texted Urtula, according to the Boston Globe. Advertisement     But You's abuse throughout their relationship had been ""near constant,"" Rollins said on Thursday. It became more disturbing and more frequent in the days before his death, as documented in the text messages and other evidence.Rollins added the case showed how serious domestic violence is, and that it can affect many types of victims and take many forms. She urged anyone experiencing intimate partner violence to reach out to law enforcement or community groups for help.""We want you healthy and alive,"" she said.

“I think someone entered something in your chart wrong,” a physician's assistant said to me over a video call on Saturday. “It says you’ve had COVID-19 three times.”“Nope, not a mistake.” I smiled, chuckling at her confounded expression. “Isn’t that hilarious?”At this point, nearly two years into this pandemic, vaccinated and having symptomatic COVID for the third time, all I can really do is laugh.I’ve been first in line for each new variant. I’m a COVID nerd, collecting each new edition. I gotta catch ’em all. I’m one of those guys in the lawn chairs outside of the Apple Store every time a new iPhone drops. I’ve punched each hole on the variant punch card: Omicron, Delta, and original flavor. Coronavirus 3: The Sickening. Advertisement  I know this is no laughing matter. People I know have died, or nearly died, from COVID. I am lucky I am not immunocompromised. I am lucky to have access to doctors, resources, and a support system. I don’t have asthma. I’m lucky I have enough breath to laugh at all.“Wow, that is brutal, I’m so sorry,” Dr. Deepta Bhattacharya, a professor of immunobiology at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, said to me after I told him about my situation. “But boy, I would love to get some blood samples from you.”I was flattered.Bhattacharya says my situation is incredibly rare. Including all my infections and vaccinations, I have been directly exposed to the virus, or parts of it that trigger an immune reaction, five times. My antibodies should be as jacked as an Instagram bodybuilder. But apparently, they’re not.It was hard for him to say why this has been the case for me. It’s possible I am genetically predisposed to have low antibody levels. Or it could be that I “won the bad luck jackpot.”Even if I do seem to be a freak of immunological nature, I am not the only one. For this article I tweeted about being cursed thrice with COVID, hoping to find others. After sifting through dozens of predictably brutal condemnations of my behavior from total strangers, I found I was not alone.“So what’s wrong with us?” Lucien Baskin, a 23-year-old graduate student who lives in Midwood, Brooklyn, asked me — once I fought my fatigue enough to give them a call. “Should I buy a lottery ticket?” Advertisement  The First Time I Got COVIDThe first time I got COVID, hipster that I am, was right when it started trending. It was in March 2020, the first week of lockdown. Back then, we were so young and dumb. There were barely any COVID tests available to the general public (unlike now, where you need to wait hours for a nose swab). Losing your sense of taste and smell was just a rumored symptom.Lucien, who uses he/they pronouns, got it for the first time in February 2021. They attribute this to their large apartment building where few people wear masks.As I lay on my couch and felt like I couldn’t move, my partner at the time zipped around me, making jokes and playing music, full of nervous energy. I had a splitting headache that I thought was a migraine. I suggested I may have The Novel Coronavirus, but my partner convinced me it was just anxiety about the world ending. Fair enough. But then I accidentally smashed a bottle of perfume on my bathroom floor and it smelled like nothing.Lucien also had a high fever and contemplated going to the hospital that first time, but they opted to just eat a bunch of Tylenol and try to sleep it off. Luckily, that worked.A couple months later, my sense of smell had returned and I tested positive for antibodies. My live-in partner, for whatever reason, did not.The Second Time I Got COVIDIn April 2021, the vaccine came. I got a double shot of Moderna. Lucien got Pfizer. For a brief moment, everything seemed like it was going to be OK. No one wore masks indoors. Strangers smiled at each other on the street. I went dancing in a crowded indoor bar with my friends. At first I nearly had a panic attack — I hadn’t smelled strangers’ sweat in over a year — but then I took a couple shots of tequila and sang along to Madonna and openly cried with relief. It was euphoric. This was not the second time I got COVID. Advertisement  Lucien was more conservative in their behavior than me. They believe they caught it a second time watching the European championship games indoors at a local café in early July, right as the Delta variant started spreading around New York. They couldn’t believe it.
 


I got it just a few weeks later, in mid-August. New York hadn’t yet passed the law requiring bars and restaurants to check vaccine cards and IDs for entry, so I had started wearing a mask again when ordering. I went to a bar with a large outdoor area and an indoor dance floor with some coworkers, briefly dancing inside. I went to an outdoor work party. I was lucky enough to not have to go into an office and rarely had to leave my neighborhood. I took no more risks than most of my vaccinated friends, and many of them took more risks than me.One afternoon, I went to the beach. I thought it was cold out, but no one else did. My throat started to hurt. I didn’t think I had COVID, but I got tested anyway: one rapid, one PCR. The rapid was negative. The next day, I got an email about my PCR: positive. I slammed my computer shut and started crying.I don’t know how I got it this second time, either. I informed everyone I had seen, even the person who I had likely kissed while infected. No one tested positive. My friend’s husband (jokingly?) accused me of being a hippie who had lied about her vaccine status.Lucien said their symptoms were less severe the second time. For me, it was worse. This could have been that the symptoms actually were more intense, or it could have been because I got dumped on day one of my 10-day quarantine.My symptoms were flu-like at first: low-grade fever, headache, congestion, mild cough. But then those faded, and the symptoms became more easily justified as psychological. I wondered if I actually couldn’t breathe or was just having a days-long anxiety attack. My primary care doctor told me to get a pulse oximeter to measure my oxygen levels and prescribed me an inhaler. If you’re 95% oxygen saturation or above, you’re good; 91–94, contact a doctor. Below 90, call 911. My oxygen levels never went below the point when you should check yourself into a hospital, but they got close.I attempted to distract myself with work but would find that I was regularly writing words phonetically instead of how they were actually spelled. At a certain point, it felt like I’d hit an invisible wall. Suddenly, even typing “Not feeling good, gotta take a break” in Slack took significant effort. It was deeply depressing and isolating. I would try to go for a jog, something I had been doing nearly every day for months, and feel fine as I did it only to be hit over the head with a hammer of renewed symptoms hours or a day later. I was lying on the floor a lot. My cat seemed concerned.These symptoms lasted months after I was allowed back out in the world. I couldn’t drink alcohol without almost immediately feeling like I had developed a cold. I felt I looked older, that I had lost some of my hair. I took advantage of what I thought must be a renewed set of powerful antibodies to socialize with friends, only to feel, all of a sudden, that I had to get home immediately. Despite my last name, I hate Irish goodbyes. I love the drama of a long farewell.The Third Time Having COVIDBy late October, I felt mostly normal. I started running again and drinking alcohol. I went to a residency in rural Virginia for a month and wrote part of a book.I couldn't get access to the booster in Virginia. When I returned to New York just before Thanksgiving, I attempted to get boosted but was turned away at the door due to a scheduling error.My birthday was Dec. 6. All I wanted was to turn 30 with some friends.I gathered a few people — not too many — at a bar on a Monday, when I thought it would be relatively empty. Two of my close friends, bless their hearts, had just returned from attending Art Basel in Miami. My office holiday party was that week but I decided not to go, joking that it was likely to be a superspreader event. Plus, several of my closest friends were driving and flying in from various states and countries to gather upstate in celebration of the end of my third decade. I didn’t want to risk infecting them. I waited four days after my indoor bar experience and got a rapid and a PCR test. Both negative.While I was upstate with my friends, with us singing in each other’s faces, accidentally switching wine glasses and water bottles, people in New York City were contracting COVID at a faster rate than ever before.Turns out I was part of that wave. Somehow, 10 days from the last time I saw them, no one else from my saliva-swapping birthday celebration has tested positive or had symptoms. I am the unlucky one. But I am grateful I did not give all my best friends COVID.This Omicron wave is Lucien’s third time, too, even though they got their booster two weeks before being exposed to the virus. They posted a screenshot of their three positive tests on Instagram Stories and wrote “Oops, I did it again.”“Honestly, being able to write that caption sort of made it all worth it,” Lucien joked as we both dissolved into giggles.
 


This latest experience, for both of us, was much more mild than previous infections. We agreed that this time we recognized it. We woke up with symptoms others could mistake for a cold and just knew, somehow, that it was COVID, again. For me it was something about the way my skin felt my first day of symptoms: hot and prickly, though not like a normal fever, and a cough that felt like something was stuck in my throat.What was most different this time was that my spirits have been strangely high. Maybe it’s just acceptance. This is despite the March 2020–esque shaming that has reemerged in society. Despite people telling me that I must be being reckless to have gotten it this often.Maybe they’re right. But I was taking calculated risks to try to live my life while trying my best not to infect the more vulnerable. If I’m feeling sick, I stay home. I wear my mask when I’m supposed to. As soon as I’m out of quarantine, I’ll try again to get my booster. That’s all I can do.And in any case, this is a public health issue. Blaming individual actions only kicks people while they’re down. It also draws attention away from government officials and healthcare companies to do things like increase global vaccine access and make testing more easily affordable and available.I understand my story scares people. It’s easier to decide it’s my fault than something that could happen to you.Hopefully, That Was The Last TimeNearly everyone I know right now in New York City has either recently tested positive or been exposed. While I wish that it weren’t the case, it has leant a camaraderie to this experience that was significantly lacking the first two times. This time I have been isolating, but I have not been isolated.I’m in multiple group chats — named “media girls w/ covid” and “Ema’s little covid warriors” — in which friends share jokes and commiserate about symptoms and boredom. They’ve also served as a helpful means of getting medical advice and care when the healthcare systems we rely on are overwhelmed. My experience with this virus has made me a valued resource. The other day my friend referred to me as “the COVID Doula.”I am not dispensing medical advice, don’t worry. But I can recommend an oximeter, which you can order from your local pharmacy and lends peace of mind when you’re feeling short of breath. I can suggest asking your doctor, if you have one, about getting an inhaler, which can help open up your airways when it's hard to breathe. Don’t drink alcohol, even if you’re feeling better. Watch movies over TV shows — the time passes quicker. Eucalyptus in the shower is pretty, smells good, and helps with respiratory issues. Mucinex is great for congestion and coughs and gets me a little high in a fun way. (I am not condoning recreational abuse of over-the-counter drugs!) Drink endless liquids. If you’re having chest pains unrelated to coughing, call a doctor.I felt this camaraderie as I spoke to Lucien as well. We compared symptoms and genetic backgrounds, attempting to see if we have anything in common. But then we came to the question that has been on our minds as we’ve been shut inside: Are the rules different for us now?“I am really confused about what to do next,” Lucien said. “I’ve been thinking, when I’m done with my quarantine this time, I’m good, right? I can take the train and be out in the world?”“We have to be immune, at least for a little bit,” I responded, desperation peaking in my voice. I want to spend Christmas with my family.“This has failed me multiple times, this way of thinking,” Lucien said, adding that he is supposed to teach in person next semester. “Do we keep getting boosters? Do we isolate forever? What are the rules for us? How are we supposed to know? It’s not like we can look up the research on people who have had COVID three times.”Lucien is right, Bhattacharya confirmed. There have been some studies on reinfection, but they have indicated that most people with antibodies who get reinfected are asymptomatic, or have symptoms so mild they don’t notice they’re sick. He was unaware of any studies of people having three symptomatic infections. This is why he wants my blood.Bhattacharya did have some good news — not for me or Lucien, but for most of you: Us being vaccinated and getting COVID three times in less than two years is not a dark omen of an inevitable future. You are not likely to become us.“Three symptomatic infections with vaccines sandwiched in between there… That’s sort of different level unlucky, Ema, I’m sorry,” Bhattacharya said.Based on studies of prior coronavirus patterns, as this pandemic continues, and as new variants like Omicron spring up, people will get reinfected with some frequency, he continued. And part of the reason it's spread like wildfire, he said, is because there are still a lot of people with no immunity whatsoever.“But with the assistance of vaccines and prior infections leading to some immunity, an increasingly large fraction of those [getting reinfected] will be, if not completely asymptomatic, symptomatic to the point where you hardly notice it.”How long it will take to get to that place, Bhattacharya added, is still up in the air.“I guess we’re sort of the guinea pigs to see what this looks like,” Lucien said at the end of our conversation. “And if we both end up with COVID again in February, well…”I’m going to act as though I have the same immunity as everyone else, at least for the next month. I’m going to celebrate the holidays. I’m going to see my friends. Maybe I’m being Charlie Brown trying to kick the football over and over only to have it pulled away each time, but I can’t keep myself in a bubble forever. I’ve gotta live my life.But if you’re a scientist and you want to study my blood, please, by all means, take it. Merry Christmas. ●

Former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter was found guilty on manslaughter charges by a jury on Thursday for fatally shooting Daunte Wright.Potter remained composed as Hennepin County District Judge Regina Chu announced the convictions on two charges: first-degree manslaughter predicated on reckless use/handling of a firearm and second-degree manslaughter. Advertisement     Potter now faces several years in prison. She will be sentenced on Feb. 18.The former officer was handcuffed and taken into custody after the verdict was announced, despite a request from her attorneys that she remain out on bail until she is sentenced. ""I cannot treat this case differently from any other case,"" Chu said.Wright's mother, Katie Bryant, told reporters after the verdict that she was overcome with emotion to hear Potter be convicted. ""I kind of let out a yelp because it was built up in the anticipation of what was to come while we were waiting the last few days,"" she said.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said police officers in the state are held in high regard — and to high standards. The conviction, he said, ""shows the whole world that those of you who enforce the law are also having to live by it, and that's a good thing."" Advertisement     ""We have a degree of accountability for Daunte's death,"" he said. ""Accountability is not justice. Justice is restoration. Justice would be restoring Daunte to life and making the Wright family whole again. Justice is beyond the reach that we have in this life for Daunte.""The jury had earlier indicated they were heading toward a potential deadlock, asking the judge on Tuesday what they should do if they were unable to reach a verdict. They were instructed to continue deliberating and did so for almost four days in total.
 


Potter’s conviction comes after she killed the 20-year-old Black motorist during an April 11 traffic stop in the Minneapolis suburbs when the 26-year veteran of the Brooklyn Center Police Department accidentally reached for her handgun instead of her Taser.“This was no little oopsie,” prosecutor Erin Eldridge told the 12 members of the jury in closing arguments on Monday. “This was not putting the wrong date on a check. This was not entering the wrong password somewhere. This was a colossal screwup, a blunder of epic proportions.” Advertisement     The deadly accident was caught on police body camera footage that showed Potter yelling “Taser” before she fired her handgun. “Oh, shit. I shot him. I grabbed the wrong fucking gun,” she then said. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. I’m going to prison.""Potter was subsequently charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter over Wright’s death. To convict her, prosecutors had to prove she acted with recklessness or culpable negligence when she defied years of training and mixed up the weapons.Potter, who resigned after the incident, had always admitted to the shooting but had been adamant that it was an accident during a police encounter that was quickly spiraling out of control and for which she did not deserve to go to prison. “I’m sorry it happened. I’m so sorry,” Potter testified last week. “I didn’t want to hurt anybody.”
 


Defense attorney Earl Gray said Potter had “made a mistake” that could not be seen as a crime.Instead, Gray sought to place blame on Wright for seeking to flee as officers tried to arrest him — actions, Gray said, that put police in danger and to which Potter had been trying to respond with an appropriate, but ultimately mistaken and fatal, use of force. Advertisement     “Daunte Wright caused his own death, unfortunately,” Gray said in closing arguments. “Those are the cold hard facts of the evidence.”Wright had been on his way to a car wash when Potter and a junior officer she was training pulled him over after noticing he had expired tags and an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, a violation of state law. Potter testified that had she been alone she would likely not have stopped Wright, saying that an air freshener was a minor violation and that people were having trouble updating their registrations at the DMV due to the coronavirus pandemic.But when they did a search of his name, they discovered there was a warrant out for his arrest. Wright had missed a court appearance for two misdemeanor charges: carrying a handgun without a permit and running from police last June.Learning of the gun charge, Potter said, made her and her fellow officers wary that Wright might have a weapon on him. However, she conceded in court that she did not see any weapon in Wright’s possession and that he never threatened or punched her or her fellow officers.Alayna Albrecht-Payton, Wright’s girlfriend, was with him during the traffic stop and testified that Wright had been “nervous and flustered” during the police encounter.She tearfully recalled in court how Wright had been on the phone with his mother when he was shot, and how Albrecht-Payton tried in vain to save his life. Advertisement     “I didn’t know what to do, so I just put my hands over his chest and tried to hold [the wound] and tried to scream his name,” she said. “I just tried to have him talk to me. I just kept saying, ‘Daunte, Daunte, just say something please, just talk to me.' And he just couldn’t — I know he tried, I know he wanted to.”""I replay that image in my head daily,"" Albrecht-Payton said.Wright’s mother, Bryant, also testified in court, describing how she had frantically tried to call her son back, only to have Albrecht-Payton answer and begin screaming. ""She said that they shot him and she faced the phone toward the driver's seat,"" Bryant said. ""My son was lying there.""The fatal shooting reignited protests against police killings in Minneapolis, a city that had already been shaken by the murder of George Floyd less than a year earlier. Dozens of people were arrested.Prosecutors sought to portray Potter as an experienced veteran of the force who had undergone extensive annual training on Taser use, only to act with extreme recklessness.“Accidents,” Eldridge said, “can still be crimes.”

Joan Didion, who chronicled everything from counterculture to grief in cold and cutting works of writing, died Thursday. She was 87.Didion died at her New York home from Parkinson’s disease, according to a statement to the press from her publisher, Knopf.“Joan was a brilliant observer and listener, a wise and subtle teller of truths about our present and future,” said Knopf editor Shelley Wagner. “She was fierce and fearless in her reporting. Her writing is timeless and powerful, and her prose has influenced millions.” Advertisement     A fiction author, screenplay writer, essayist, reporter, and memoirist, Didion’s prose helped shape the New Journalism movement, and writing itself, in the latter half of the 20th century after she began her career at Vogue magazine.From columns that explored the cultural revolution of the 1960s to works of fiction that shed pretense for bitter realism, like Play It As It Lays (1970) and A Book of Common Prayer (1977), Didion won fans and acclaim for her exploration of social and personal decay. Her works captured the pain and beauty of being alive by exploring how humanity at once tries to tear itself apart and stitch itself together.
 


Didion first solidified her voice as a journalist by capturing the turmoil of the 1960s, writing for Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post. Her first work of nonfiction, 1968’s Slouching Towards Bethlehem, explored the sense of loneliness, anger, and transformation of California’s counterculture movement, centered in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the late 1960s.California, where the writer was born in 1934, forever captivated Didion, drawing her back throughout her life. “No one wrote better about California and how place shapes our identities,” author Dana Spiotta wrote for Vogue in 2017. Advertisement     Some of Didion’s fondest and happiest memories, she said, were on the beach in Malibu, watching the waves with her husband and young daughter Quintana. She lived all over the Golden State, chronicling its struggles and changes while fixing herself and her history at the center. In doing so, Didion personalized the experience for the reader in a way that felt almost revolutionary.In The White Album (1979), for example, she shared a story of having to go to a hospital in Santa Monica for a psychiatric evaluation after complaining of intense, inexplicable vertigo and nausea as part of her own journey trying to make sense of where she stood in the world.Didion married her own search for spirituality and purpose with her country’s, making a complex, overwhelming cultural shift personal. Her writings changed and defined American journalism and history.
 


One of her most famous essays, ""Goodbye to All That,"" also helped spark the genre of ""Why I Left New York"" pieces. Ultimately, after two decades in Los Angeles, she and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, returned to New York in the late 1980s. The couple were devoted to one another, both personally and professionally, and wrote the screenplay for A Star Is Born (1976) together, among other projects. Advertisement     After Dunne, also a renowned writer and editor, died suddenly in 2003, Didion penned The Year of Magical Thinking, a memoir exploring her raw distress following the death of her husband of 40 years while also navigating her daughter’s severe health issues. She canonized what it meant to grieve, once again coupling intimate stories and memories of her life with research and studies on sorrow and dying. She reported on her own trauma, her own heartbreak, allowing all readers a window into a deeply universal experience.“I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us,” she wrote. “I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.”Didion then adapted the memoir, which won her a National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, into a stage play. In a subsequent memoir, Blue Nights (2011), Didion wrote about the death of her daughter.In 2013, she was honored by then-president Barack Obama with a National Humanities Medal for being what he described as “one of our sharpest and most respected observers of American politics and culture.”“Exploring the culture around us and exposing the depths of sorrow,” the presidential proclamation declared, “Ms. Didion has produced works of startling honesty and fierce intellect, rendered personal stories universal, and illuminated the seemingly peripheral details that are central to our lives.” Advertisement     In her later years, Didion maintained her effortless cool. In 2015, French fashion house Céline chose the reclusive writer as the star of its advertising campaign. The images, showing Didion with her diminutive frame and the brand’s giant sunglasses, quickly went viral.In a curt interview with Time magazine in January, Didion’s trademark matter-of-fact demeanor that shaped her writing remained on full display. “What does it mean to you to be called the voice of your generation?” the interviewer asked.“I don’t have the slightest idea,” Didion responded.

Earlier this month, British media once again platformed a talking point pushed by anti-trans activists. The Sunday Times, among other outlets, ""reported"" on a backlash to a hypothetical scenario in which a sex offender might choose to identify as a woman. That an imaginary notion was elevated into a news item speaks to the entrenched anti-transness of British media.But then Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling tweeted the article, further elevating the narrative; she became a trending topic on Twitter, promoting a link between transness and sexual violence. US media covered her tweet as a controversy that implied there might be a real threat posed by trans self-determination. It might be too obvious to state, but there isn’t. In fact, there is actually an ongoing epidemic of violence against trans women, and no such pattern of trans women committing violence against cis women or anyone else.This was, however, the latest point of panic in a wave reacting to the so-called transgender tipping point of visibility. And Rowling in particular has chosen to make herself the face of this backlash. Advertisement  Just last year, she publicly targeted clinics where trans youth receive lifesaving gender-affirming treatment, turning trans bodily self-determination into a story about the supposedly threatened safety of cis children. She has also mocked evolving public health language that includes trans men and nonbinary people, hijacking that recognition to create a story about the supposed erasure of cis women.Like fellow billionaire Peter Thiel, she has even reportedly deployed her money and power to try to silence criticism. And yet all the while her anti-trans campaigning is generally characterized by the media as “controversial” “views”: not part of an explicit agenda, but an ongoing human interest mystery chronicled as a perplexing personal evolution.Rowling’s status as a celebrity billionaire affords her extra protection and the benefit of the doubt while also helping to amplify her talking points. But it’s specifically because she speaks as a white woman with “concerns” about the safety of women and children that her anti-trans framing is accepted on Twitter and treated by the media at large as worthy of debate.Never explicitly framed as a misinformation agent who might merit deplatforming, Rowling is a symptom of the current media ecosystem, in which disinformation about minority identities is accepted as legitimate controversy. Advertisement  This scenario comes into play whenever powerful people, institutions, or political organizations raise public concerns about the protection of majority groups, especially white women and children.In fact, two of the biggest, seemingly unrelated, culture war stories this year were propelled by a similar reframing of misinformation as legitimate debate. These so-called controversies were supposedly about trans people, especially trans girls and women, and teaching history, known as the critical race theory debate.Both were part of political backlashes that came in response to increased visibility for minority groups: increased representation of trans people in media and public debate about gender and the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.Framed largely by right-wing activists and think tanks as human interest issues about fairness in sports and classrooms, they circulated into national legacy media — including publications like USA Today, CBS, The Atlantic, and the New York Times — through first-person opinion pieces by mothers of cis athletes raising fears about trans inclusion or human interest reports featuring on-the-ground stories of white moms airing complaints about supposed radical ideas being introduced in schools.Whatever the content of the reporting or articles, in platforming these issues through the “concerns” of cis and white people, mainstream media helped distort what constitutes legitimate perspectives for coverage, and in doing so sidelined the actual difficulties experienced by marginalized communities, including Black and trans youth.Ultimately, this kind of coverage raises deeper questions about news organizations and who decides the perspective of “culture war” journalism.
 


There’s a long history in the US of setting the terms of debate by centering media narratives around the well-being of white women and children. It’s usually associated with anti-Black and anti-gay right-wing activism and can be traced back to anti–school integration campaigns in the ’60s, through “save the children” anti-gay campaigns in the ’70s, and even the coverage questioning how children would fare under marriages between same-sex couples in the aughts.Right-wing activists used similar framing to introduce the so-called controversy over “critical race theory.” Attempts to eradicate histories of race in the US are nothing new. As recently as 2011, activists attempted to ban ethnic studies and Mexican American studies curricula in Arizona. But “ethnic studies” simply doesn’t have the polarizing — or “concerning” — ring necessary to stoke a national panic about existing curricular offerings like studying civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.The term “critical race theory” was perfect for right-wing campaigns, though, because, as one activist told the New Yorker this summer, to “most” Americans it “connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.” So a long-term campaign to dismantle any talk of race and history in schools was rebranded as a crusade against critical race theory, even though that term actually refers to a graduate-level theory about the intersections of law, culture, and structural racism that has nothing to do with elementary history in classrooms.
 


The idea of the country as race-obsessed and race discourse as destructively divisive was already percolating in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, especially after George Floyd’s murder.Outlets like the New York Times and the Atlantic dedicated valuable resources to reporting on the supposed excesses of anti-racism. These “nuance” stories by white journalists included one about a Black father’s school board campaign against anti-racism. In the Times, there was a story about a Black student who made a supposedly false accusation of racial profiling at Smith College. Even attempts at self-reflection centered whiteness and painted anti-racism as an elitist concern; a story about the Times’ own newsroom racism was used to highlight how privileged white high schoolers now felt entitled to call out racism.Right-wing think tanks, like the Manhattan Institute, promoted that precise notion online and in legacy media to activate parents into believing anti-racism was out of control. Quotes from concerned moms further stoked these fears: “They are making my son feel like a racist because of the pigmentation of his skin.”The idea of “talking about race” wasn’t necessarily new to many Black and brown parents for whom discussing the realities of inequality and existing in a white world isn’t an “option” in the same way. Yet outlets including CBS and the Atlantic picked up that framing too, feeding into the sense that radically new ideas were suddenly being introduced with headlines like, “When the culture war comes for the kids,” and “How young is too young to teach kids about race?” (The latter headline was changed after a backlash.)As the November elections neared, news stories about suburban or small-town parents battling over school curricula started popping up as well. The framing of these battles through reported human interest stories, rather than, say, misinformation explainers, suggested that these were newsworthy grassroots issues that spoke to broad parental fears rather than a vocal minority stoking social media disinformation.To some degree, the stories discredited the panic about race education in schools by pointing out the organizations and dark money groups (like the Judicial Crisis Network) who helped fund these campaigns and including voices of supporters of existing curriculums. But they still promoted the idea that these battles represented two equal sides of inflamed national feelings, rather than a strategically invented controversy and well-funded top-down disinformation campaigns.Ultimately, the timing and framing of these stories about race and education highlight that they were not deemed newsworthy because of concerns of the community members at the center, Black parents and youth, or the massive ongoing inequality around race and class that still permeates public schools. Instead, they helped reframe debate to center white parental anxieties.
 


In many ways, this same scenario — misinformation platformed as debate — has been playing out in the coverage of trans people, long before J.K. Rowling seized the moment as a major anti-trans voice. Newsrooms lacking in trans journalists had been framing trans existence through “concerns” that trans people were incapable of deciding their bodily self-determination on their own.This type of clueless question about how young is too young for children to know their gender, coming from outside the trans community, was epitomized by a now-infamous 2018 Atlantic cover story. It explicitly addressed imagined anxious white parents with the (misgendering) headline, “Your child says she’s trans...she’s 13.”The story and its cis panic about trans identity as some kind of trend among teens was later completely debunked by other news outlets. Since then, gender historians have shown the long history of trans children, studies have confirmed that trans children are just as certain about their gender as cis teens. The Atlantic never officially apologized for the story’s framing, including misgendering and outing the cover model. (The writer, however, has since been placed on watch lists for anti-LGBTQ journalism).
 


In the real world, all trans people are not white and not middle class and have little access to healthcare even if they can find an affirming clinic, especially when most insurance companies refuse to cover such care. Trans people struggle not with identity itself, but with an anti-trans world that restricts access to resources for transition and features gatekeepers who set rules and timelines on cis terms. And unsurprisingly, November’s elections saw right-wing activists promoting a new wave of bills blocking access to healthcare for trans people. As GLAAD pointed out, that Atlantic cover story was used in a legal brief filed by seven state attorneys general in a federal lawsuit seeking to roll back existing healthcare access for trans people.This year, right-wing activists expanded their “concern” to sports. And it wasn’t an accident they set that arena as a location to invent debate. Like classrooms, sports are imagined by white Americans as a neutral space of meritocracy, and right-wing think tanks purposely promoted that setting for human interest stories about fairness.Publications including USA Today and the Economist took the bait, uncritically platforming first-person pieces by white mothers and white athletes airing out concerns about maybe having to compete against trans girls. The misinformation spread by cis athletes about hormonal or strength differences was ultimately debunked.But real questions about meritocracy, including around race and class inequality, did not even get folded into these chronicles, revealing that narratives were about the protection of supposedly endangered young white women. This becomes clearer when considering that the surveillance regarding testosterone levels has primarily targeted cis Black women athletes.Given the minority status of trans people in society at large, it’s unsurprising that trans athletes never even materialized in most states where the bills were being pushed. Yet even positive human interest pieces about trans athletes were reactive ones in which trans humanity was rendered visible only in terms of the wave of cis fears.As with the CRT coverage, the focus on questions about youth transition or sports isn’t actually about the struggles of trans people at all, which include disproportionately high rates of housing insecurity and under or unemployment.The sidelining of actual trans issues in order to debate imaginary fears does, however, speak to broader systemic problems with media and the way that trans people circulate as objects of coverage for cis people rather than subjects of their own reality. Even media attempts to cover anti-trans activism have turned into debates between cis women about transness through controversies about trans exclusionary radical feminists (TERFS).That moniker itself, recently used to describe Rowling, platforms anti-trans activists within the context of feminism and has lent legitimacy to their efforts, portraying bigotry as some kind of newfangled intellectual exercise over the meaning of feminism or queer community. In fact, anti-transness is part of a long history of class and racial exclusions in feminism, both in media and, most importantly, in the real world, where trans identity has been made into a scapegoat for anger about inequality more broadly.
 


It’s unquestionable that the CRT and trans “debates” have been pushed into the media by right-wing activism and conservative politicians through strategic waves of anti-CRT and anti-trans bills. They’re even timed to purposely inflame conservatives and rally the base for elections.But at this point, it’s too easy to see anti-trans and anti-Black concern-mongering as just an issue of right-wing misinformation. After all, these framings are accepted for coverage via the editorial judgments of majority white and cis newsrooms.So-called culture war issues are where the media allows itself maximal editorializing on behalf of cis white “anxieties” and fears about a changing world. But the terms for what becomes a culture war story are not decided by the public. Instead, they are decided in newsrooms that don’t mirror reality but certainly help shape it.American newsrooms are even whiter than the country as a whole, and it’s in that context of media echo chambers that “critical race theory” is repackaged as controversial. Most Americans believe the history of slavery should be taught, for instance. And after the 2021 November election, polls showed that even the idea that critical race theory drove elections was overstated.Similarly, trans rights are actually not “controversial” in the US population at large. But trans journalists are woefully underrepresented in newsrooms. It’s predictable that cis journalists talking to each other about transness results in stories that home in on and magnify cis debates about trans identity. This dynamic sidelines the potential richness of good faith exchanges within the trans community about the complexity of existing in a cis world.Current thinking about misinformation is focused on anti-science or partisan campaigns that exist in the social media ether. But there are other important questions, like the way the media feeds into misinformation by platforming sources that reframe debate outside the terms of the communities these “debates” actually affect. Advertisement  
 


“Partisanship” is still the favored term in journalism for talking about media “balance.” But considering editorial judgment through partisanship simply recreates existing power imbalances by focusing on issues about race, class, and gender only if they’re legible through the lens of Republican vs. Democrat. It would mean something quite different if corporate media held itself accountable to the communities it covers rather than political parties.Categorizing questions about ethical coverage through partisanship issues also helps ignore uncomfortable realities about news capitalism, like the fact that newsrooms need to make a profit and stories are often packaged for advertisers and imagined white readers.Financial incentives are a major reason why it’s hard to wean media off engaging with misinformative framings to capture cis and white readers, which still constitute a majority of the public. After all, these panicked stories feed engagement for Twitter, Facebook, legacy media, and new venture capitalist corporate platforms like Substack.It’s not an accident that in all the race and trans backlash stories, class is invoked not to call out how white middle- and upper-class perspectives shape newsrooms (including through media CEOs). Instead, it is invoked to imply that anti-racism or trans rights are somehow an “elitist” concern. This framing takes pressure off the publications themselves to engage with these issues as a labor concern in their own newsrooms. But divorcing stories about class and identity from the real world and existing power structures is a distortion. Framing and context shouldn’t only be dictated by cis white fears and concerns.Still, there have been some changes by newsrooms around the framing of stories to acknowledge power imbalances in the real world. The Verge has updated its policies for giving big tech companies anonymity as background sources for articles. Some news organizations are questioning the uncritical use of police sources when ascertaining the truth of events. Cis and white “concerned parents” might be less obviously identifiable as problematic sources, but it’s a powerful category of people due for a similar reckoning.Tellingly, after a backlash to the white framing of its “how young is too young” CRT story, CBS changed the headline — not to, say, “White Parents Are Finally Having to Grapple with Questions Others Routinely Do.” Instead, it was replaced with a nonclickbait-y mouthful: “Documentary explores debate over how and when race should be taught in schools.”That shift of the framing to “debate” is the customary way mainstream media dodges any pressure about “taking sides.” But platforming “both sides” implies we live in an already equal world. We don’t. And that’s a fact. ●

“My dad and anyone involved in this conservatorship and my management who played a key role in punishing me — ma’am, they should be in jail,” Spears told the judge in June. “This conservatorship has allowed my dad to ruin my life. Advertisement     “I would honestly like to sue my family, to be totally honest with you,” she said. “I want to be able to be heard on what they did to me by making me keep this in for so long.”Jamie has repeatedly claimed that he only wants what’s “best” for his daughter while vehemently denying all allegations of conservatorship abuse.
 


Presumably quoting the tons of praise written online about her legacy, Spears noted that she’s a “multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning pop icon,” with “nearly 100 million records sold worldwide.”“Spears has sold 33.6 million albums in the U.S. and ranks as the 18th-best selling album artist in the Nielsen era,” the caption continued. “Her songs have drawn 25 billion in cumulative radio airplay audience and 2.6 billion on-demand U.S. audio and video streams combined and she’s sold 39.8 million singles.”
 


“Yes … I will be my own cheerleader … why ???? I’m here to remind my white ‘classy’ family that I haven’t forgotten what they did to me nor will I ever forget,” she added.
 


According to the filings, Jamie and his legal team maintained that the payment would be “necessary” to ensure that the outstanding financial arrangements of the conservatorship “can be wound up quickly and efficiently.”And as Variety reported, Jamie’s legal counsel, Alex Weingarten, charges a rate of approximately $1,200 per hour.
 


Rosengart added, “[Spears] poignantly testified about the pain her father caused her and this only adds to it. This is not what a father who loves his daughter does.”

Acupressure mat — $19.47 from AmazonI get really bad headaches periodically and generally bounce between over-the-counter medications, none of which seem to make a dent in the pain. Earlier this year I asked a neighbor with migraines if he’d had any medication successes recently, and he said, “You know what has helped? This.” I expected the link would go to some newfangled headache medicine or perhaps an herbal remedy, but instead it went to this truly odd product, a yoga mat crossed with a medieval torture device rendered in crisp white plastic spikes Somewhat inexplicably, it does in fact seem to help my headaches, and it also causes me to fall into a weird deep sleep within moments of lying down on it. (Warning: Set an alarm; I recently conked out for two hours on this thing, and my back was aflame when I finally woke up.) I have found it comforting to know that when the pain gets bad, I can just lie down on my bed of piercing plastic nails. —Sam Henig
 


Theragun Prime — $299 at Macy’sYou know what I got into over the pandemic? Running. Really original, I know. But between the stress of the lockdown and the stress of being a new father, I needed a consistent and mindless physical release.You know what happens when you run regularly? Your whole lower body starts to hurt. I tend to be skeptical of shortcuts around pain. I don’t really think you can trick the body. And if you do, I think you tend to pay for it later. But a few months after I did my first loop around Prospect Park, wracked with calf and hip pain, I caved and ordered a Theragun. Yes, a Theragun. That loud and heavy percussive massager that looks like a sex toy for German ravers.The thing works. You stick it where it hurts and then it hurts less. Doesn’t get much simpler. There are lots of things I don’t like about it. It costs too much, and when I lie on the couch blasting the tension out of my quads, my wife will sometimes cruise by and ask, “Pleasuring yourself again?” To which I say, 20 miles a week may strain my knee, but words will never hurt me. —Joe Bernstein
 


Contoured sleep mask — $18.99 at AmazonLet me start by being really honest: I cannot function with less than eight hours of sleep. I know there are a lot of freaks out there who are proud to sleep like five hours a night or whatever, but I am not like you. Sleeping is my favorite — and incredibly vital!! — hobby, so you know you can trust me, and I'm here to tell you to get this contoured sleep mask made of memory foam. It has changed my sleeping life in a way no other product ever has. The second night I used it, I slept straight through my alarm and got a full 12 hours of deep sleep, which was terrifying for the purposes of my alarm’s quality, but fantastic for my mind and body. It's pitch-black in there, but the contouring means you can open your eyes even in the mask, plus you can keep the blinds open and let the sunshine in to help you wake up once you take it off — but not a moment earlier. I also find the soft memory foam to be sort of like an extra pillow just for my eyes, and the act of putting it on when it's time to sleep keeps me off my phone and tells my brain it's time to shut shit down. I love her. —Addy Baird
 


La Prairie foam cleanser — $90 at Neiman MarcusA few years back, a Very Nice person gifted me with some travel-size products from a Swiss company called La Prairie. I knew nothing about the brand. They seemed nice. A small tub of something called skin caviar, a refining lotion, and the one standout: a tiny tube of foaming face cleanser. It smelled great — a faint hint of peppermint, maybe? (It’s pink, so maybe my brain filled in that scent on its own.) It was unlike any cleanser I had used before. It rinsed away in seconds (no soapy feel) and left my face feeling weirdly super clean. I have dry skin, and it never felt like this particular product was drying it out more — rather, it was the opposite. Really, it wasn’t like any other facial cleansing product I’ve tried (and I’ve tried lots). I only needed a tiny bit, and it lasted forever. When I ran out of all these cute little products, I had a bit of a shock. This stuff is expensive! As in, some of the products are $200-an-ounce expensive. (Ahem, $180 sunscreen, anyone?) Anyway, I was like, Welp that’s nice, now where’s my favorite Neutrogena cleansing gel? (It’s also a great product.) However, this year I found the La Prairie foam cleanser for $90. I know, that’s a LOT for a face wash. But it’s a 4-oz. tube (which, BTW, is huge by beauty product standards), and it’s lasted for months — it may even last a year. I don’t generally spend that much on beauty products, but this is the rare item that seemed like it would be OK for a fancyish gift or an occasional splurge. [Editor’s note: We found this for cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews for the seller said that it may be expired or counterfeit, which is not uncommon for high-end skincare products on Amazon or other reseller sites.] —Theresa Tamkins Advertisement  
 


Acure Curiously Clarifying Shampoo — $5.99 at AmazonI have combination hair and exercise a lot, so finding the perfect shampoo has been a lifelong journey. Acure is affordable, smells great, has a vegan formula, never dries out my scalp, and has kept my hair feeling shiny from my roots to my tips! —Nicole Fallert
 


Revlon One-Step Dryer Brush — $34.88 on AmazonIt takes less than 10 minutes for me to dry my long, thick hair with this dryer brush. It doesn't dry out my hair or scalp — and is loved by many of my friends with different hair types from curly to straight. —Nicole Fallert
 


Larq self-cleaning water bottle — $95 at LarqI don’t know about you but I am really bad about washing my water bottle. Frankly, it just doesn’t cross my mind often enough, and then I realize it’s gross and I’m embarrassed and avoid dealing with it. This is probably something I should address in therapy, but until then, there’s the Larq self-cleaning water bottle. Yes, $95 is a ridiculously high price for a water bottle — but if there were a water bottle worth such a price tag, it would be this one. Not only does this thing clean itself with a UV light inside the lid, but it is also able to filter water (with two different settings based on how much filtering the water might need). And thanks to some sort of god-tier insulation, it keeps my water cold as hell. My previous main water bottle was a giant 42-oz. Hydroflask, which was literally giving me shoulder problems from carrying it around. The Larq bottle is 17 oz., which means I’m filling it up often but also that it fits perfectly in my bag. —Addy Baird
 


Intake Breathing nose magnets — $67 from Intake BreathingI have a garbage septum that has robbed me of clear and easy breathing for decades. It interferes with my sleep, makes exercising annoying, and on occasion humiliates me in meetings or public gatherings when I suddenly realize I have unconsciously begun pulling on my cheek to stretch open a nostril. It sucks. And, yes, I should have it fixed surgically. But instead of doing that, I have relied on a bucket full of pharmacy-shelf flop-nostril countermeasures. Breathe Right's little nose strips, nostril dilators, I’ve tried them all. They have all helped to some extent, but none have given me the throw-the-windows-wide nostril opening relief of Intake Breathing’s nose magnets. These things improve on the concept of nasal strips by turning them into an inflexible and *magnetized* nose bridge that then attaches to little metal-filled bandage-y things you stick on your nostrils. Ridiculous, you say? Ridiculously ingenious. Because they are not flimsy, and they rely on the POWER of magnetism instead of the power of adhesive athletic tape, Intake opens up your airways and keeps them that way without falling off your face. Yes, I look like I have a Transformer on my nose when I'm wearing it. But I can breathe without feeling like I’m suffocating, and that’s all that matters. —John Paczkowski
 


Shakti Mat — $69 at ShaktiThe Shakti Mat is a modern-day bed of nails. It is a deeply weird synergy of BDSM and meditation — but once you get over the initial pain, it is incredibly relaxing. I have no idea how or why it works. But it was definitely more fun than the pandemic. —Tom Warren Advertisement  
 


Innisfree SPF 36 daily sunscreen — $15 at AmazonI’m old enough to have observed the frightening reality of sun damage and have been scared straight into assiduous sunscreen application. I previously tried and liked Supergoop’s “Play” everyday SPF 50 sunscreen, but at $22 it’s kind of pricey. So I looked for some cheaper options, and the closest dupe for Supergood was from K-beauty brand Innisfree for $15. It has the same texture that is moisturizing and light, “dewy” without being sticky. I have dry skin, and I don’t love the matte finish that La Roche-Posay, Neutrogena, and Sun Bum’s face options have. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Harry’s deodorant — $5 at Harry’sDo you sweat more than you’d like? Profusely, perhaps? Are you tired of spending $12-plus on “clinical-strength” over-the-counter antiperspirants that smell like your grandmother? Then check out Harry’s sweat control solutions. The company, which started out as a subscription shaving outfit, now makes a line of delightful deodorants. The scents are interesting and not at all cloying (goodbye “baby powder,” hello “stone” and “redwood”), the “enhanced sweat control” version works just as well as anything you’d buy from BIG DEODORANT, and it only costs $5. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Temple Tape sweatband – $8.95 and Temple TapeLike so many other people over the last year and change, my hair grew out a lot. Like, *a lot.* But when it came time to reenter society and get a haircut, I wanted to keep some of the volume I had picked up over lockdown. My new barber made it happen (Masako, you’re seriously the best) but three weeks after any cut, it’d run into a problem. My longer hair would start getting in the way at the gym or on a run. Some buffs I had on hand before the pandemic worked fine when I was home, but I didn’t want to be wearing some handout covered in corporate logos all the time. Enter Temple Tape headbands, which I found while looking for a headband brand I could order outside of Amazon. They’re durable, keep my hair up and sweat out of my eyes, and come in a bunch of simple colors. They’re even based in Brooklyn so I get to say I’m supporting a local business.I feel like headbands are having a moment. They’re ubiquitous on college and pro football sidelines and even Drake sported one while boxing. The appeal is easy to understand. They’re functional, but they’re also so fun to wear that I have a headband on during all my workouts now, even if I got my hair cut the day before. —Eric MorrowOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

Red RocketIt’s probably just me, but lately it feels like storytelling has been taken over by Marvel universes and absurd streaming-bait about feline subcultures and hetero masochism. I miss quieter movies with their slow-build character studies. Watching director Sean Baker’s Red Rocket, a portrait of fictional aging porn actor Mikey Saber (Simon Rex), was a reminder of how great those can be. Advertisement     Baker wanted to capture the energy of “suitcase pimps,” porn impresarios he met while researching the adult industry for his 2012 film Starlet. And he found the perfect vehicle in Rex, a former model, MTV VJ, and white rapper known as Dirt Nasty who’s spent a lifetime around deluded LA actors, to masterfully bring the archetype to life.In the film, Mikey returns to his small Texas town, which he’d left after convincing girlfriend Lexi (Bree Elrod) to move to LA and become a porn star with him. Now his estranged wife, she’s back in town, staying with her mom and stuck in a dead-end life.Mikey is a compelling presence from the moment he appears onscreen, begging Lexi and her mom Lil (Brenda Deiss) to let him crash with them while he gets back on his feet. Soon he’s resettling into his old life, quickly finding his lane as a weed dealer, and we get snippets of his backstory as he reconnects with locals. As his moods shift, from whiny boy to daydreaming pothead and then to entitled harebrained schemer — and around again — the film really gives a sense of how circular his life is.Without shying away from the darkness, the script finds the comedy of how some men exist in a kind of perpetual nowness, parasitically living off everyone around them, especially women — even, eventually, and queasily, a 17-year-old named Strawberry (Suzanna Son). Advertisement     For all the acclaim about Baker’s ability to capture outsider class and gender perspectives, I find that the least convincing and most gimmicky aspect of his work — especially in 2015’s Tangerine. But he’s finally found a perfect muse in Mikey, and this memorable portrait of the amoral ruthlessness of a small-town con artist is some of his best work yet. —Alessa DominguezWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Licorice PizzaPaul Thomas Anderson’s newest film, Licorice Pizza, is a delightful coming-of-age romp that could certainly be called a rom-com if PTA made rom-coms. Set in 1970s Encino, the film stars Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper as Gary Valentine, a fast-talking 15-year-old child star who is constantly reinventing himself to make money and be the kind of man twentysomething Alana (Alana Haim) would want to date. The will-they-won’t-they serves as the spine of this story, but this charming film is really a love letter to the Valley, packed with a cast of offbeat characters (keep an eye out for a cameo from Leonardo DiCaprio’s dad) that are as memorable as those found in PTA’s other Golden Age valley epic, Boogie Nights. Bradley Cooper is hilarious as Jon Peters, hairstylist/producer/boyfriend of Barbra Streisand, and Sean Penn is spot-on as a washed-up William Holden. (Along with much critical praise, the film is also garnering controversy for the nature of its central relationship and how Anderson handled racism in the scenes regarding a particular Valley restaurant.) This film — which is as sprawling as the Valley it tries to capture — will command a second (and third) watch. —Karolina WaclawiakWhere to watch: Now playing in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin. Wide release on Christmas.
 


West Side StoryI’m torn because there have been convincing arguments about why West Side Story isn’t worth reviving, given its racist origin story, but I did really enjoy this film adaptation of the 1957 musical and 1961 movie. Director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner rehabilitate some of the original’s worst tendencies with renewed attention to setting and history. Robert Moses and his “slum clearance” projects loom over the production; when the Sharks and the Jets fight in the beginning of the movie, we see blood. Latinx folks play the Puerto Rican parts, undoing the brownface travesty of the original movie. Ultimately, though, it’s the performances that won me over: Ariana Debose is electrifying as Anita, David Alvarez is hot as Bernardo, and Mike Faist weirdly moving as Riff. And the presence of 90-year-old Rita Moreno, in a role written specifically for her, is especially heartening. Yes, the plot is still kind of risible, but I left the theater teary-eyed. —Tomi ObaroWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


PassingI was so amped to see Passing, starring Tessa Thompson and Ruth Negga, that in the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere in November, I decided to read the book. Author Nella Larsen’s source material was an excellent primer for actor-turned-writer/director Rebecca Hall’s film, set mostly during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and ’30s, gorgeously captured in black and white.The story focuses primarily on Irene and Clare, played respectively by Thompson and Negga. The women haven’t spoken to one another since they were children, but one hot summer day they unexpectedly reunite in the tea room of a hotel, taking refuge from the sun. What’s immediately clear from the outset is that the women have chosen two wildly different paths for their lives. While both characters are Black women with fair skin, Clare has decided to live her life passing as a white woman.Passing, like the novel it shares a name with, is layered. Though you may be expecting a simple story about the dangers of passing for another race, the film allows the audience to consider other questions beyond surface-level observations. Instead of condemning Clare’s choice to live as a white woman, the film raises questions around why someone might choose a life of exile from their people. Meanwhile, Irene lives a charmed life in Harlem, and the audience experiences the story through her perspective. She lives as a Black woman but has passed from time to time herself in situations one may deem harmless or inconsequential — this may not make her and Clare one and the same, but the parallels add complexity to her point of view. Irene finds fault with Clare's decision because of its inherent danger, but the ease with which Irene herself has chosen to selectively pass in her own life demonstrates how seductive, and limiting, that choice can be.The film isn’t only about race and its contradictions. It’s also about class and community, and the stifling boxes we have created for ourselves. Passing is one of the must-see films of 2021, one that will stay in your mind well after the credits have begun to roll. —Michael BlackmonWhere to watch: Netflix
 


The Power of the DogIn The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s first feature since 2009’s Bright Star, two very different brothers come to blows about the best way to run their family’s ranch — and their lives — in 1920s Montana. Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) is greatly displeased when, during a cattle drive, his brother George (Jesse Plemons) becomes smitten with a widowed inn owner named Rose (Kirsten Dunst). She’s the mother of a sweet, gangly, effeminate young man, Peter (the extraordinary Kodi Smit-McPhee), and when she and George marry, Phil makes it his mission to bully and unsettle his new family members: Rose, because he thinks she’s after George’s money, and Peter because of his lisp and gentle ways.This is a gorgeous, smoldering film with an all-star ensemble cast, anchored by Cumberbatch playing against type as the towering and quietly terrifying Phil. A haunting score by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood leads the audience through the awesome tableaus of the American West (New Zealand, technically) and drip-feeds us with a mounting sense of isolation and dread. It’s a slow build, and for most of the time, I had no idea where this was all heading — which only made its shocking but well-earned ending all the more gratifying. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: Netflix
 


BenedettaI knew that a film about lesbian nuns from the director who brought us gloriously unhinged classics like 1995’s Showgirls would be right up my alley, but I still wasn’t prepared for just how much I’d enjoy Paul Verhoeven’s rollicking new nunsploitation flick, Benedetta.Virginie Efira, the absolutely stunning, César-winning Belgian actor, plays the title character, who arrives at an Italian convent as a young girl and grows up to believe — or so she’ll have us think — that she’s been granted strange, grand visions from heaven. Some of the convent leadership are pleased that talk of miracles will bring more fortune and fame to the abbey, but others aren’t convinced that Benedetta’s telling the whole truth about what she sees.Meanwhile, a new nun named Bartolomea (Daphné Patakia) begins to distract Benedetta from her sexy dreams of Jesus through seductions of her own. The women begin an illicit affair, which involves, delightfully, a small statue of the Virgin Mary repurposed as a 17th-century dildo. They’re threatened with discovery as the plague draws ever nearer to the convent’s walls. Will Benedetta’s personal relationship with God spare their Tuscan town from mass death, or will her forbidden sapphism be both her and the village’s demise? You’re going to want to find out — trust me. —Shannon KeatingWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Drive My CarRyusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car has already landed plenty of awards (mostly the kind with “best international” attached) and at least one major American laurel (it’s on Barack Obama’s yearly favorite movies list). It has also inspired a healthy number of adoring online jokes from cinephiles, which is a little surprising given it’s a Japanese movie with a runtime of almost three hours about death, loss, and [glances at notes] the plays of Anton Chekhov.Yet there’s no mystery about its appeal. Languorous like life itself, the film is split into two parts. The first introduces the gentle rhythms of theater actor and director Yusuke Kafuku’s existence. Yusuke seems satisfied: His creative output is distinctive and well-received, and he shares a loving relationship with his wife. But returning home one day, he discovers with a shock that his world stands on shaky ground, and shortly afterward, his wife dies unexpectedly.Two years later, Yusuke is invited to direct Uncle Vanya for a festival in Hiroshima. After a former director’s accident, the festival won’t allow Yusuke to drive to work, instead hiring a laconic young woman named Misaki as his chauffeur. This is just one of the jarring disruptions to his stasis; another is a young actor whose presence reminds him of what he’s lost. With the status quo so disturbed, Yusuke’s grief turns from a quiet anchor into dead weight.Drive My Car shows people devastated by loss, allowing time to ripen those wounds and distort their understanding of love and purpose. For these characters, avoiding suffering has been a necessity; it’s enabled them to keep going, but at a cost. Dealing with this kind of loss requires the deepest bravery; Drive My Car is a film that bears witness to the grief process, one of the most common and transformative things we ever face. —Estelle TangWhere to watch: In theaters now
 


Nine DaysWhat makes a life worth living? How do you decide if a life is well-lived? These are the central questions behind Nine Days, the feature debut from director Edson Oda. I saw it in August, and it’s been rattling around my brain ever since. Nine Days follows Will (Winston Duke) as he goes about his job: He is an arbiter, tasked with the responsibility of interviewing souls and deciding which will get the opportunity to go to earth and inhabit a human body.While the premise is supernatural, the mechanics of Nine Days are rooted in the triumphs and traumas of humanity. Will is forced to confront what he values about life as he cycles through the candidates for the job. Should he select the soul least likely to suffer? The one most likely to withstand the brutality of existence? Or the soul most oriented to softness and fragility? Will wrestles with these questions as he tries to process a tragic loss in his life.What makes Nine Days work is its ability to resist descending into a full-blown philosophy lesson. Instead, this film breathes and creates space for these questions while letting the characters inhabit their own tragedies. There’s a lot of restraint here, which makes more room for the film’s striking emotionality. In addition to a stunning performance from Zazie Beetz, Nine Days also features Benedict Wong, Tony Hale, and Bill Skarsgård. —Elamin AbdelmahmoudWhere to watch: Amazon Prime
 


House of GucciListen, I know. I know a lot of great movies came out this year, like the one about the adult woman who spends way too much time with a teenage boy in the ’70s or the one about Princess Diana if everyone did ketamine. I know! I get it! Movies are art! I do not really like art, I’ve recently decided; suffice to say the pandemic (and being alive through it) has given my brain a very soft, almost gummy worm–like quality, and as such, I cannot tolerate any movies that require me to think. I’m sure The Green Knight is very good, but the fact that I’m not typing out these sentences as “me like moobies, moobies fun for no thinky” is really a feat of personal strength.You know when I didn’t have to think? Throughout the entire 158 minutes of House of Gucci. The reviews are largely true: The film’s pacing is so chaotic you barely feel time pass at all, it’s an extended fashion show for the Gucci catalog (and, I guess, whatever suede couch Jared Leto is cosplaying as), and Lady Gaga is the only redeeming quality of the whole movie. Why was everyone so hard on her Italian accent when this movie features Leto yelling “Boof!”I’m not saying House of Gucci is “good,” but I am saying that it made me and my friend laugh so hard in the theater that we had to shove our masks into our mouths so that we wouldn’t get kicked out. It is an eminently watchable movie that drifts on by with a few moments of good acting, but even more moments of absolute camp. There’s one really boring movie in House of Gucci, about the business of a struggling fashion house that everyone knows isn’t struggling anymore. But then there’s a far better narrative inside, about Gaga’s character, a jilted wife who builds her husband (Adam Driver) and his business up, who is cast aside when he’s no longer compelled by her, and then driven to plotting his murder. The tedious part gives you time to look at Instagram and the compelling parts will distract you from the crushing reality of your life. Isn’t that all we really want from the movies? Brain soft, Gucci soothing, and that’s all she wrote. —Scaachi KoulWhere to watch: In theaters now

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, aka Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on Thursday shared the first image of their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in a family portrait featured on their official Christmas card.The photo shows the family of four laughing as Meghan holds her daughter in her arms. Six-month-old Lilibet, nicknamed ""Lili,"" is the Sussexes' second child. Their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born May 6, 2019. As the Christmas card photo shows, Archie has inherited his father's distinctive red hair. Advertisement     ""This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa,' and Lili made us a family,"" Harry and Meghan said in their card.""As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families — from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave.""According to the card and a statement from Harry and Meghan's charitable entity, the Archewell Foundation, the couple made contributions to: Team Rubicon; Welcome.US; Human First Coalition; Humanity Crew; Paid Leave For All; PL+US; and Marshall Plan for Moms.""Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours! As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie, and Lili,"" the Sussexes signed the card. Advertisement     
 


The picture was taken by photographer (and Polish prince) Alexi Lubomirski, who also took the couples' official engagement and wedding photos.On Thursday, he shared the family portrait to his personal Instagram with a caption about his experience shooting the Sussexes.""This is one of those rare and special projects, that one is fortunate enough to be a part of,"" he said. ""To be able to continue the story of this family whom I first photographed as an engaged couple, then on the day of their wedding, as a married couple and now seeing their love manifest into two beautiful children, has been a delightful honour.""""To be trusted by your subjects enough, to open themselves up and have their connection documented and translated into an image, is one of the greatest gifts a photographer can have,"" Lubomirski wrote. ""This day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex was one such joyous experience, and one that I feel extremely privileged to have been invited to capture.""
 


This year's picture is different from the family's 2020 holiday card, which was a stylized image of Harry, Meghan, and Archie with the family's rescue dogs, Guy, a beagle, and Pula, a black lab.“The original photo of the family was taken at their home earlier this month by The Duchess’s mother,"" a Sussex spokesperson told People at the time. ""The small Christmas tree, including the homemade ornaments and other decorations, were selected by Archie, and the tree will be replanted after the holidays.”Harry and Meghan have carefully guarded their children's privacy since moving to the United States in March 2020. They successfully sued a paparazzi agency for taking drone footage of their son, Archie, in the home where they first stayed in California, winning a settlement and an apology from X17, the company that took the photos and made them available for sale.In the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Meghan talked about how scared she was to pose for pictures with Archie in front of the world's press soon after he was born, the way that her sister-in-law has done with each of her three pregnancies.""I was very scared of having to offer up our baby,"" she said. The Sussexes would wait until two days after Archie's birth to appear before cameras with their son. Advertisement     
 


No longer working members of the royal family, Harry and Meghan have been able to keep their daughter away from the media for the first six months of her life.Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born June 4 at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California and weighed 7 pounds, 11 ounces. She is named after her great-grandmother, the Queen, and her paternal grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales.On June 6, Harry and Meghan released a personal statement alongside the news of the birth of their child.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili,"" they said. ""She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""

483,Put the Kris in Kristmas!,"


WASHINGTON – Multiple people who attended midterm strategy meetings in South Carolina hosted by a subgroup of the Democratic National Committee have tested positive for COVID-19.Between 5% and 10% of the nearly 300 attendees were infected, BuzzFeed News has learned from two people briefed on the matter.The events, hosted by the Association of the State Democratic Committee (ASDC) and DNC leadership, ran from Tuesday, Dec. 14, through Saturday, Dec. 18, in Charleston and included a mix of training sessions, meetings, and at least one reception. Attendance varied from 20 people to at times more than 100 and included state and national party leaders. Advertisement     The news comes as swaths of the nation are seeing a surge of new COVID cases — as well as long lines for tests and rolling shutdowns of businesses — as the highly contagious Omicron variant sweeps across the country. Even the White House announced that President Joe Biden had a COVID scare — he was in close contact with a mid-level staffer who tested positive after being near the president for 30 minutes during a flight back from an unrelated South Carolina event on Air Force One last Friday. Biden has since tested negative.The events in South Carolina included several days of ASDC sessions and a meeting hosted by the DNC executive committee on Saturday. When officials were made aware that two vendors who had been in attendance later tested positive, the DNC offered everyone PCR tests, Trav Robertson, the South Carolina Democratic Party chair, told BuzzFeed News in an interview Tuesday.On Dec. 17, DNC chair Jaime Harrison spoke at an ASDC event but stood at least six feet away at a podium and remained fully masked in front of a crowd of about 70 people, a DNC spokesperson said, who added that Harrison has since tested negative.Jason Rae, the secretary of the DNC, tested negative while at home in Milwaukee, flew to South Carolina on Dec. 16, but then tested positive on Friday, Dec. 17. On Saturday, he dialed into a smaller event where nearly two-thirds of the attendees were participating virtually. He then rented a car and drove home to Milwaukee rather than flying, according to a DNC spokesperson.

The Biden administration on Wednesday announced that it will continue to allow millions of Americans to put off their student loan payments as the US grapples with a surge of COVID infections driven by the new Omicron variant.The move means federal student loan borrowers in the US won’t have to restart their debt payment until May 1, instead of the previous deadline of Jan. 31. Interest rates will also remain at 0% during the extension. Advertisement     “We know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments,” President Joe Biden said in a statement Wednesday.His announcement comes amid pressure from some Democrats ahead of a tenuous midterm election cycle and as, according to the Department of Education, 41 million borrowers remain saddled with student loan debt in a pandemic that has continued to threaten a full economic recovery. Collectively, they hold more than $1.7 trillion in federal and nonfederal loans, according to the Institute for College Access & Success.Just days before the announcement, the US surpassed 50 million COVID cases and 800,000 deaths, according to the CDC. New cases rose by 27% in the last two weeks, the New York Times reported. Some cities have resumed mask mandates or expanded testing options, but the fear of getting sick, as well as rising inflation and the lagging supply chain, are threatening to reverse the year’s economic progress.About 6 in 10 college seniors who graduated in 2019 had an average student loan debt of about $28,950, according to a report by the Institute for College Access & Success. And the amount most borrowers owe has been increasing annually as a reflection of economic health and how much schools receive from state investment, the institute found. Low-income and Black students are also disproportionately burdened by loan payments — about half of Black bachelor’s degree graduates with debt struggle to make federal loan payments “even in good economic times,” a situation likely exacerbated by the pandemic, according to the report. Advertisement     “Even though it was a bit confusing … it was still the right thing to do in terms of financial impact on borrowers,” the institute’s associate director of policy and advocacy Michele Streeter told BuzzFeed News.She added that it’s reasonable for borrowers to feel upended by the way things “change on a dime” due to the pandemic and to not know if or when to make long-term financial plans.“I’m glad they are not letting [politics] rule the day,” Streeter said. “If there are conditions that warrant another extension, regardless of the political implications … I would hope they continue to prioritize that.”“This additional extension of the repayment pause will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our Administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers,” Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement.“As we prepare for the return to repayment in May, we will continue to provide tools and supports to borrowers so they can enter into the repayment plan that is responsive to their financial situation, such as an income-driven repayment plan.” Advertisement     A major issue for advocates like Streeter is a lack of clarity from the Department of Education on their plans for borrowers, she said.“There hasn’t been clear communication,” she said, citing that advocates want an answer from the administration on whether borrowers who are in default — roughly 7 million — will be restored when repayments are restarted.Meanwhile, a coalition of lawmakers who had asked Biden to cancel $50,000 in student debt for every borrower lauded the extensions.“Extending the pause will help millions of Americans make ends meet, especially as we overcome the Omicron variant. We continue to call on President Biden to take executive action to cancel $50,000 in student debt, which will help close the racial wealth gap for borrowers and accelerate our economic recovery,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley said in a joint statement with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.During the extension, Biden said his administration will work to prepare borrowers for the payments to come. The Department of Education said in its statement this would come through steps such as providing billions of dollars of relief for borrowers with disabilities and helping small business owners through the Paycheck Protection Program.

It’s just before 8:45 p.m. on April 20, 2020, about a month into the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Los Angeles suburb of Westlake Village, and I’m waiting for our family’s harasser to show up.Specifically, I’m hiding in the back of my mom’s SUV, wearing a black hoodie and holding a walkie-talkie in one hand and a can of pepper spray in the other. The car is in its usual spot in the driveway of our two-story home, the second-to-last house at the top of a steep hill, just before a cul-de-sac. It’s especially quiet up here tonight. No traffic. No pedestrians. Just the star-speckled sky and the silhouettes of the Santa Monica Mountains.My pulse thumps loudly, and my body is tense with a fear I’ve never felt before. Even though the car is locked, and even though my parents are inside watching me on the security cameras, I can’t help but wonder what could happen if I cough or sneeze or, more realistically, start shaking so uncontrollably that I make a noise. Will he run? Will he come toward the car and peer through the tinted window? It’s been over an hour and he’s due any time now. I practice taking slow, deep breaths. Advertisement  Then it happens.From the corner of my eye, I detect movement among the stillness. A man emerges from the darkness, ascending our steep street. I watch in a state of adrenaline-fueled paralysis as this stranger gets closer. Thanks to a streetlamp, I have a clear view. His eyes scan our home, darting from window to window for any signs of detection. I silently plead with myself to stay calm as he passes within 10 feet of me, his gaze landing on the car’s dark rear window — the only barrier separating us. I hold my breath. A split second passes before he beelines toward our mailbox and opens it.Slowly, shakily, I raise the walkie-talkie to my lips, quivering in disbelief at what I’m witnessing firsthand after all this time. “Carole Baskin,” I say into the speaker. “I repeat, Carole Baskin is here.”Carole Baskin, of course, is the infamous feline fanatic featured in Tiger King, the Netflix docuseries that Americans have been devouring during these early days of quarantine. But to my family and me, “Carole Baskin” is the code name for a man who sows fear and inspires a revulsion not unlike what the show’s protagonist, Joe Exotic, feels for his activist archnemesis. No large cats were harmed in the making of this story, but my family and I — particularly my two younger sisters and me — were haunted night after night, constantly looking over our shoulders and often afraid to be at home. I think that gives us the right to add some levity to this dark, surreal episode of our lives. Advertisement  So tonight, while the rest of the world is wrapping up Zoom yoga classes, trying their carefully washed hands at sourdough starters, or worrying where their next paycheck will come from, my family and I have been focused on something entirely different: catching the man who has been harassing us and ending his perverse reign of terror once and for all.
 


Nonsensical notes and nude picsTo understand how my family and I wound up spending the pandemic surveilling our harasser, you need to rewind half a decade. In early 2015, I was a 19-year-old sophomore at New York University enduring my first polar vortex. Back home, my sister Brooke, 17, was starting her last semester at our local public high school, while my youngest sister, 15-year-old Summer, attended a private school. Advertisement  That’s when the first note appeared on the windshield of our white Jeep Wrangler, which Brooke had been driving regularly and which was usually parked in our driveway. The note was typed in a small, generic font on regular printer paper and wasn’t addressed to anyone in particular. Although we don’t remember the exact message, it was short, and we distinctly recall the author’s secret-admirer writing style, with its childish tone and poor grammar. The letter was unsigned and unremarkable, either an innocent gesture or a friendly prank, we figured, so we threw it out.A couple of weeks later, on Feb. 12, a second note appeared under the windshield wipers on the Jeep. Addressed again to no one, it was cryptic. It was also really creepy:Thanks for returning the picture, you don’t have straight hair anyways---I guess you don’t like red for valentines? Its all for fun and I wonder if anyone has ever made you think what is next-the anticipation is the best part- enjoy the starbucks and if you want, future gifts to enjoy?Huh? What picture was the sender thanking us for supposedly returning? And what was the gibberish about not liking red for Valentine’s Day or the bit about straight hair? And what Starbucks was one of us meant to “enjoy”? The note was unsettling enough that we hung onto it.Eight days later, note #3 appeared on the Jeep:I know you like starbucks. I got you something so you can enjoy your favorite drink or two. Its in the normal hiding spot.BTW, Happy Valentine’s Day :)SMThe references still eluded us, as did the whereabouts of the so-called “normal hiding spot,” although my family searched the perimeter of our house thoroughly. But there was a more puzzling question: Who was “SM”? We racked our brains, scoured our school phone directories and Instagram followers for a suspect with those initials, to no avail. Was “SM” just an alias? Regardless, we were now officially spooked. Summer was so petrified she started sleeping with kitchen knives hidden throughout her room.
 


A month later, the stranger took things to the next level with another letter that was accompanied by a torn-out page from a Playboy-type magazine with a picture of a nude dark-haired woman who appeared to be Latina. Not wanting to further distress our youngest sister or our already hyper-paranoid father, Brooke panicked and threw away the note, although she recounted that the message said something about the naked woman being “your twin.” This was especially confusing, considering that Brooke has red hair, Summer has blonde hair, and all three of us are white. Was this person not aware of what we looked like? Or was bewildering us all a part of some twisted game? Either way, we felt that this was no harmless secret admirer but a sexually motivated harasser. Around our house, my family refers to this person by a much more sinister term than “harasser,” but my editor wouldn’t let me use it in this story.One week later, Brooke found a box of chocolates on the Jeep. Then she found a fifth note. It was addressed to “S,” presumably for Summer.SDid you see my last note to you? The box behind the wall has something that reminds me of when we met. Interesting….SMWhat box? What wall? Who is this freak?Twice that February, we found roses on our property. Sometime around March 25, a neighbor told Summer that she’d left some babysitting money she owed her, along with one of Summer’s sweatshirts, in our mailbox. But when Summer checked, the mailbox was empty. We had our suspicions.On April 2, they were confirmed. Still curious about the “box behind the wall” and the “normal hiding spot,” my mom ventured over the wall in the cul-de-sac that separates the street from a grassy hiking trailhead, and, sure enough, there it was: a box nestled beneath some branches.Inside, she found a half-assed shrine composed of stolen belongings and childish gifts: Summer’s missing sweatshirt, the envelope of babysitting money, which had been emptied and ripped in half, a Starbucks gift card, a beaded bracelet, a college postcard addressed to Summer that we had thrown in our trash, and a sticker of Summer’s high school logo. My mom retrieved Summer’s possessions and snapped pictures of the contents but put the box back in its original spot, not wanting this person to think my sister had accepted their offerings.My parents filed a report with our local cops, the LA County Sheriff’s Department station in Lost Hills, but nothing came of it; we had neither received any explicit threats of violence nor had any leads.
 


Confrontation by the mailboxMy family stayed on high alert that spring 2015. One evening in late April, my highly protective dad was doing a routine window check when he spotted a man walking a small black-and-white dog. The man opened our mailbox, peered inside with what looked like a laser light, and then closed it.My dad darted outside to confront the stranger. “Were you just looking in my mailbox?”The guy said something along the lines of “Uh, no, there was a dog barking.”My dad challenged him, but the guy walked away. High on adrenaline and unsure what to do, my dad ducked into the house, grabbed his keys, jumped in the car, and drove along next to the guy. He looked to be a white guy in his late 40s, balding, forgettably dressed, neither tall nor short. He kept his eyes locked forward and continued briskly down the street while my dad followed him in hopes of seeing where he lived and taking his picture. But when my dad realized he’d forgotten his cellphone, he impulsively made a U-turn and sped back home. When he returned moments later, the man was nowhere in sight.Up to that point, we’d been convinced the culprit was an awkward teenager — some lonely perverted incel. We even had a kid who lived close by in mind. But this guy at our mailbox forced us to rethink our suspicions. Could this grown man truly be the creep behind all the disturbing notes and stolen items? Was the pathetic writing style all a ploy to sound more adolescent? Yet at the same time, we had nothing else to connect this guy to the shrine box or the notes; we had to consider that this was all a strange, timely coincidence. The neighbor-kid theory was easier to believe. Advertisement  But as much as we had hoped the mailbox incident was unrelated, it became harder to discount. A few days later, when my parents went back over the cul-de-sac wall to check on the box, it was gone. We had installed security cameras on our house, but all the notes and gifts ceased.For about five months.In October 2015, we found note #6. It read, in part: “Hi summer, You should work at the TK,” a reference to the Tilted Kilt, a local Hooters-inspired Scottish tavern where the women servers are scantily clad in mini kilts. Attached to the note was the restaurant's business card. To our dismay, our new motion-activated security cameras didn’t capture anything, so my parents drove to the Tilted Kilt, but that was a dead end.
 


A few weeks later, though, we had a stroke of luck. My parents were driving home one evening when my dad recognized the man from the mailbox walking the same small dog in our neighborhood. Once they’d passed him, they drove out of sight, then my dad got out of the car and inconspicuously followed him on foot. The man went inside a house less than a mile from ours. Advertisement  
 


Just a guy trying to empower womenIn order to mitigate the risk of retaliation against my family, I’ll call the man “the neighbor” or “our harasser” instead of using his real name. My editor at BuzzFeed News tried to contact him to give him a chance to respond to the information in this story, including sending a letter through a lawyer who represented him, but he didn’t reply to the messages and none of the phone numbers listed under his name led to him, either.During fall 2015, the neighbor was a middle-aged husband and father living in our town of Westlake Village in Los Angeles County. He studied at a state university and found success as a wealth management adviser to affluent families in the region. He worked at a major national bank — the one we banked at, in fact — and was recognized as an industry leader by trade publications. He was involved in a variety of local charity and youth organizations. In other words, he was a prominent figure in the community.But there was one portion of his résumé that jumped out at us. The neighbor, of all people, was affiliated with an organization dedicated to providing career and education opportunities for women and girls. The local wealth management firm he had cofounded even hosted an annual event aimed at supporting women in the community. Advertisement  How? By preying on them before they’re old enough to drive? By terrifying them with ominous notes and gifts? By taking their babysitting money? By lurking in their neighborhoods and leaving cutouts from porn magazines on their windshields?When my parents shared their findings with Summer, she didn’t recognize the neighbor’s name or picture. However, we quickly figured out that he had a child who attended her high school, though this classmate and my sister had never spoken. In other words, our harasser was...a local school dad.Even more alarming, Summer was fairly confident that she’d seen this kid when we’d been on vacation in Hawaii — not long after the mailbox confrontation but before we’d figured out his identity. We were waiting for an elevator at a hotel when the doors opened and Summer recognized the kid who got off. She didn’t take much notice of the man with the kid but assumed he was the father.That sighting, if Summer’s memory was correct, raised an eerie question: If this man really was our harasser, did he actually follow us halfway across the Pacific? Could he have pried into our bank accounts and seen that we had purchased plane tickets? Or was that paranoia speaking? Were we being completely irrational by even considering the possibility?We might never know for sure if the neighbor and his kid were vacationing in the same place as us — and, if it was them, whether it was a coincidence or his most calculated move yet. But the latter seemed too far-fetched, too next-level scary to believe, and in hindsight I think our doubts about that theory colored what we had let ourselves believe about the neighbor. Just as we couldn’t prove that he’d followed us to Hawaii, we didn’t have any solid evidence that he’d done anything more than peer into our mailbox that one time. We tried to employ reason over speculation. Maybe Summer didn’t see his kid on vacation. Maybe the neighbor really was looking for a barking dog rather than snooping in our mailbox. ​​ Advertisement  I know this all might sound naive, but at the time it made sense because, once again, everything stopped. After note #6 in October 2015, there were no more letters, no more gifts behind the wall...for four years. Maybe, we thought, it really was that teenager from our neighborhood and that he’d finally outgrown his weird obsession or went away to college. We didn’t have the answers we’d hoped for, but we found consolation in knowing that our family’s harasser had retired.Except he hadn’t.
 


A new target: meIn fall 2019, Brooke was living in Spain. Summer was enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder for a couple years, but had just returned to California with hopes of transferring to a local school and was living in the San Fernando Valley. I’d just landed a job in West Hollywood and was commuting from my parents’ house while looking for an apartment in the city. Advertisement  One night while my parents were out of town, I pulled into the driveway in the Jeep — the same one my sisters and I had been sharing for years. Our other shared car, an old Acura, was parked on the street. I noticed that one of the windshield wipers was sticking straight up. It seemed odd, but I didn’t think much of it and put the wiper down.But over the next few weeks, it happened again. And again. And again. We checked the surveillance footage, but the cameras hadn’t been activated by the perpetrator’s motion. I tried not to dwell on it, but a question burned in the back of my brain: After four years, was our harasser back? I got my answer when we found note #7 on the Acura’s windshield. It included another cutout from a porn mag, only this time the note was addressed to me. It read, in part:Tess- you are so darn cute and love watching you drive that jeep. … You are so hot. … See what you look like to me.The incident was a one-off, probably because I moved to an apartment in LA not long after. But how did this guy know I was the only sister home? It had to be the kid who lived near us, as opposed to the neighbor, who was about a mile away and out of sight.Whoever it was, we knew we needed real evidence to go back to the police. In 2020, it turned out we’d get plenty.When the pandemic hit in early March, I found myself temporarily out of a job and back in the suburbs, hunkering down with my parents for what we had all assumed would be a few dull weeks of time off. It was only a matter of days before the windshield wiper shenanigans recommenced. But neither the three motion detection cameras nor the camouflage surveillance camera we’d hidden in our front yard had captured anyone in the act.Next came note #8, this time addressed to Summer, who was still living elsewhere. It came with more porn cutouts and read:Nice to see you back from CU. I am back from BU. You still look like you did at [high school] but I know you look like this girl behind those clothes. Miss seeing you and having you near meSMA few weeks later, I was looking out a street-facing window for the nth time that night when I jumped. There he was, a man by the mailbox. Middle-aged. Balding. Walking a small black-and-white dog, along with another very large black-and-white dog. I ducked until he was out of sight, then sprinted outside. There, wedged against the top of our mailbox and directly above where the last note had been, was a guinea pig–sized rock that in no way could have materialized there naturally.It was the neighbor. And this time, the security cameras caught him. The gravity of the situation had finally sunk in. It was really him all along.Now, we just needed evidence that linked him to the notes and gifts. Armed with our first substantial lead in years and the long days of quarantine, we escalated our efforts into a full-scale covert operation.
 


Let me remind you here that my parents had already gone to the local sheriff’s station in 2015, and nothing had happened. The neighbor wasn’t yet on our radar, and the cops weren’t about to stake out our house because of a handful of gross notes and trinkets. Sure, we could’ve just gone and knocked on his door, but my dad had already confronted him once. We still couldn’t prove that he had been behind the notes. We knew we needed to give the cops an open-and-shut case.Which brings me back to the backseat of my mom’s SUV, walkie-talkie to my mouth, confirming to my parents that I’d gotten a positive ID on the neighbor, known to my family as Carole Baskin.
 


Pushing his limitsSpring 2020 already feels like forever ago. Hospitals were overflowing with the first surge of COVID-19 patients. Panicked shoppers were emptying grocery store shelves and scrambling for toilet paper. Donald Trump was suggesting we kill the virus by injecting ourselves with bleach. Advertisement     Through it all, my parents and I optimized our operation. Every night at sundown, my mom or I would drive to a side street about halfway between the neighbor’s house and ours, park out of sight, and wait for him to walk by with his dogs. We’d disguised ourselves with hats and sunglasses, and we even borrowed my grandparents’ cars so the neighbor wouldn’t recognize ours. If we saw him en route, we’d radio up to the house, giving my dad about 10 minutes to ensure the surveillance cameras were rolling. The other person stationed at home would then run upstairs to one of the street-facing bedrooms to take still photos with a zoom lens as the neighbor opened our mailbox, messed with the windshield wipers, or rummaged around in our plants. After he left, my dad would radio whoever was on lookout in the car that he was on the way back, and my mom or I would confirm what time the neighbor returned home.On one occasion, we sent Summer a letter in the mail, figuring that the neighbor was probably aching to find something related to her. As anticipated, he opened our mailbox a day or two later, sorted through our mail, and snatched up the envelope addressed to her — our first recorded encounter linking him directly to Summer, specifically, and maybe even to mail theft.On June 10, as protests over the police killing of George Floyd coursed through the country, the neighbor took a letter for Summer out of our mailbox and placed it on the Jeep. He started bringing a flashlight and would spend several moments peering into the car, presumably drinking in whatever personal belongings he could make out through the windows.Some nights, he appeared to play it cool, walking by our house without so much as looking at it. Other nights, a neighbor would drive up just as he was approaching, and on those occasions it looked as if he’d abandoned his mission, just a regular guy out walking his dogs. A few times, he took longer breaks, maybe 10 days off, and we’d worry that he knew we were onto him or that he’d quit without leaving a note. And catching him leaving a note would be vital. It was the last piece of evidence we needed on camera to prove that he wasn’t just some creep who messed with our property but the same person who had been harassing us since 2015. I imagine the withdrawals must be unbearable, though, and the neighbor would inevitably resurface to get his fix. Advertisement     Around this time, I started doing some research. I wanted to get a glimpse into how dangerous our situation might be. What I found was nightmare-inducing. I’ll spare you the academic explanation, as I’m no psychologist and I know very little about this man other than what I’ve observed. But, according to what I’d read, experts agree there are five types of stalkers, all of which have the potential to harm their victims, although few actually do. But the fifth and one of the rarest types, the “predatory” stalker, is the most terrifying. For predatory stalkers, “Stalking is foreplay; the real goal is sexual assault,” according to Psychology Today, and these people are the most likely to lead “double lives.” One study from the American Journal of Psychiatry states, “There is a troubling lack of warning of danger because they are the least intrusive stalkers, often only glimpsed by their victims.” I can't say what was in the neighbor’s head, but the possibilities running through my mind were bone-chilling.Given our mounting evidence and everything I’d read, we decided to talk with a friend of a friend, a retired law enforcement officer who lived nearby.This friend came over one afternoon. My parents began telling our story without naming names. Halfway through, she cut them off. “I know who this is,” she blurted out, and then said the neighbor’s name. My parents were stunned.A couple in our neighborhood had told her that their niece had had an off-putting experience with him a few years back, she explained. I reached out to the couple to learn the details. The husband told me they’d rarely interacted with the neighbor — they once invited him over for a party — so it was odd when they learned that he had contacted their niece, a college student, and messaged her online. The neighbor told the young woman that he was good friends with her aunt, and that he wanted to get together to discuss investments. This struck everyone as inappropriate and strange, considering that the neighbor had never met the niece, and he wasn’t close with the couple. Advertisement     The law enforcement friend promised to connect us with a detective when we were ready and encouraged us to keep collecting evidence in the meantime. Best-case scenario, she agreed, was that we actually get him on camera leaving one of his notes.Two weeks and several stakeouts later, we did. The ninth note was addressed to Summer, who by that point had moved back in with our parents.S-OMG. I THOUGHT YOU ARE A CLASSY GIRL LIKING V.S.: YOU LEFT A THONG ON YOUR FRONT SEAT. YOUR NOT THAT GIRL FROM THE [initials of high school] ARE YOU?I HAVE A “SUMMER” DEAL FOR YOU: LEAVE YOUR PANTIES OUT AND I’LL GET YOU A VS GIFT CARD SO YOU CAN TAKE MORE BACK TO BOULDER?IF YOU WANT A SUMMER FLING THEN ITS NOW IN YOUR SWIMMING POOL! LEAVE THIS LETTER AND PANTIES BEHIND THE WALL ON TOP OF STREET IN AN ENVELOPE WITH “ralphie” aka SM AND I WILL GET YOU V.S. GIFT CARDS PROMISE!HAVE A GOOD “SUMMER”LMKRalphie aka SMWe figured “Ralphie” was a reference to the University of Colorado Boulder’s mascot, Ralphie the Buffalo. “V.S.” must have meant Victoria’s Secret, the brand of a pair of underwear I’d left in the car, among other items of clothing. We still didn’t know what “SM” stood for. But it didn’t matter. We finally had what we needed: footage of the neighbor himself, leaving a note. I felt a cocktail of heightened emotions, a mix of disgust at this vile creep and glee for having caught him red-handed. Amped up on adrenaline, my dad and I stayed up late that night analyzing every disgusting detail of this new note, rehashing the neighbor’s every move, repeating, “I can’t believe we did it.”We got to work putting together what would be a 76-page PowerPoint to present to the authorities. In the meantime, we still had to watch out for the neighbor, who came back two days later, scoured the area where he left the note, then disappeared into the cul-de-sac for longer than normal. Looking for “panties,” presumably.It was around this time that my dad decided to revisit another key piece of evidence: the Starbucks card from the box. Back in 2015, my parents weren’t able to verify who had purchased it, but it was worth another try now that we had a name. My dad called the number on the back of the card and managed to confirm it. He learned the card was used for a series of transactions and then transferred to the neighbor’s Starbucks account.A few days later, on June 22, the neighbor outdid himself yet again. While slinking in front of our house, he may have heard Summer and her friends in the hot tub in our backyard. He took a few steps onto our driveway, staring through the side yard, as if he were trying to get a glimpse of the girls, or so we assumed. He then started climbing the small hill on the side of our property, where he crouched in the bushes overlooking our home. Was he about to go into our backyard?Watching the surveillance footage in real time on his laptop, my dad was about to sprint outside — but the neighbor, for some reason, began to descend the hill and head home.
 


Defining a threatAn LA County Sheriff’s Department officer told us that our work was the most impressive presentation they’d ever seen from a victim. We sent over extensive documentation, including a comprehensive timeline and 59 surveillance videos, with the footage lightly edited and time-stamped for optimal viewing. They even bagged some of the letters and porn mag cutouts to test for DNA.We were proud of our mountain of evidence. But even more so, we felt lucky. While many people were stressed about paying their rent or trying to juggle parenting and working remotely, we were safely quarantined, with the means and time to focus on building our case, a luxury other potential crime victims might not have.The department assigned our case to a detective. In the meantime, we went to the courthouse to apply for a temporary restraining order, the first step toward getting a permanent one. After a few bureaucratic speed bumps, we got it.The next day, my aunt and uncle waited across the street from the neighbor’s house until he got home. Then they jumped out of the car and served him. It didn’t bother me that his wife was there; we felt that she needed to know what he’d been up to on his nightly walks. Unfortunately, his now-adult kids were there too, which wasn’t ideal. But we needed to prioritize ourselves — our safety — over whatever family drama this man’s bad decisions and depraved actions might have incurred. Advertisement     In early August, about a week before the hearing for the permanent restraining order, we received devastating news from the detective: The district attorney’s office had declined to press felony stalking charges — or any other charges — against the neighbor.
 


I called the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to get some answers. The prosecutor overseeing the case explained that although she was sympathetic to us, we had insufficient evidence to prove that the neighbor’s actions satisfied all the requirements necessary to warrant a stalking charge — and there are many very specific requirements. For one, even though the neighbor showed up at our house multiple nights a week for months during the pandemic, he hadn’t followed us outside of our home, as far as we knew. He hadn’t made any explicit violent threats toward us, and while there is case law for misdemeanor stalking charges without an overt threat, we’d passed the yearlong statute of limitations for all the events that had occurred in 2015. And despite the glaring similarities between everything that happened in 2015 and 2020 — the notes signed “SM,” the messing with our cars, the missing mail — we didn’t have any actual video evidence of the neighbor doing these things back then, before our cameras were up and running. The prosecutor said she’d considered other smaller charges, like trespassing, but the neighbor had never climbed over a fence or gate, and we didn’t have a sign that clearly stated “no trespassing” in our front yard.Getting this far had taken a small army and hundreds of hours of our time. The idea that a stalking case could get shut down now was infuriating. It raised troubling questions: Someone savvy enough to refrain from making an overtly violent threat or hopping over a fence can evade accountability? If he satisfies a few — but not all — stalking requirements, he gets off free? And if the victim doesn’t have the time or money or family support to build a case like we did, how can they expect to get so much as a temporary restraining order, let alone actual justice? Advertisement     The detective told us the case would stay open for the time being, but we realized that getting a judge to grant the long-term restraining order was now more important than ever. It was our last hope.On the day of the hearing, the neighbor didn’t show up; only his lawyer was present. By this point, my dad had hired a lawyer too. In the hallway outside the courtroom, the attorneys, with our approval, struck a prehearing deal. The civil harassment restraining order would last for two years (as opposed to five), and the neighbor would not contest the accusations or evidence — that is, the copies of the notes, pictures of him tampering with our property, and the police report — that we included in our petition for the restraining order. We insisted that he attend weekly therapy sessions as well. Negotiating with this man seemed absurd, but at least we could move forward with some semblance of peace and security. His actions were now a matter of public record.
 


AftermathIn fall 2020, my family was contacted by a local reporter who’d gotten a tip about our story. We were ready for this chapter of our lives to end — but if the story was going to get out, we wanted to ensure they got the facts straight. I agreed to an interview, and my parents gave written statements.The community was virtually unaware that a potential predator walked among them since he had never been arrested. The neighbor could continue to hold his firm’s annual women’s event. He was free to work with youth organizations. In our eyes, our story would act as a public service announcement for others who might encounter him. Plus, with any luck, it would embolden other young women to speak out as well. Maybe, we thought, the district attorney assigned to the case would have a change of mind about criminal charges in light of new evidence or other people speaking up.The local newspaper wrote about our experience in a detailed two-part story. The neighbor declined to comment. His family must’ve been humiliated, and we felt for them. They were, after all, victims of his bad choices as well.When the story came out, social media lit up. Some sleuths at the newspaper tweeted that they might have solved the mystery of the neighbor’s “SM” moniker; they’d found a social media account of his that we’d somehow missed. There he was, clear as day, grinning widely in his profile picture. And his handle? It included the phrase “sexy mexy.”The neighbor relinquished his various board seats, according to the organizations he had been affiliated with. His firm’s website was taken down and remains that way. This past spring, the neighbor’s house was listed for sale. It sold in May, and a new family has since moved in.Not long after the article came out, Summer got an Instagram message from a young woman who said she used to live near the neighbor. Back in 2015, she said, her sister had been sent many notes similar to the ones we had received, along with other items, like a jewelry box with a “popped condom” in it. Reading about those similarities in the local newspaper story, she couldn’t help but wonder...But the story that stuck with me was more than a whisper. It happened after the police had questioned the neighbor and after the hearing — meaning that it happened while he had a restraining order against him. I saw it play out on Nextdoor, a social network for neighbors. A young woman in our neighborhood posted about a bobcat sighting, which is fairly common in and around our area. Looking at her profile picture, she appeared to be Summer’s age and had similar features: blonde, petite, pretty. And there in the comments was the neighbor, so seemingly concerned about this bobcat’s whereabouts — so undeterred by the police investigation into his behavior or the active restraining order against him — that he apparently just couldn’t help but ask the young woman a burning question: “What street do you live on?” ●

2021 was our second year of working from home and the year we really ramped up our home cooking efforts. How’d we do it?

Traeger Ironwood pellet grill — $1,400–$1,600 at TragerThe Traeger Ironwood pellet grill is hands down the best thing I have tried this year largely because it is responsible for so many exquisitely smoky meals but also because I am a huge barbecue dork and this may well be the holy grail (Traeger loaned BuzzFeed a grill to review). I have yet to cook a bad meal on this thing, and I have cooked more than a few of those in the past on our former grill (RIP) — despite, say, setting multiple overnight alarms to check the grill temp on a 32-hour brisket. It’s hard to explain the catastrophic despondency and frustration of discovering that a brisket you have obsessively babied with techniques painstakingly sourced from 50 different BBQ subreddits looks and tastes like the bottom of an old flip flop. But the Traeger pellet grill has, for me, made that a thing of the past. Instead of charcoal, it burns pellets methodically fed to it by a temperature-controlled auger that capably holds a slow-and-low smoke for as long as you need it to (and has a special “super smoke” feature). And it has nailed everything I’ve cooked on it — chicken, ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, sausage — in a way that’s often inspired “this is your best INSERT FOOD HERE yet” accolades from family and friends. Honestly, I wish I’d saved up (it is not cheap), gritted my teeth, and bought this a few years ago. —John Paczkowski
 


Shipment of frozen soup dumplings from Xiao Chi Jie — $39.95 at Xiao Chi JieThis Seattle-based restaurant will mail you a packet of 50 frozen soup dumplings (xiao long bao) that you keep in your freezer and then cook drunkenly when you come home late but want to reward yourself with the most delicious food known to man. Advertisement  For the uninitiated, soup dumplings are humanity’s greatest achievement. You bite the top off, sip out the delicious filling, then consume them with the sauce of your choice. Incredible.These ones are filled with either pork, shrimp and pork, or chicken. Of course, they also sell the accompanying sauces. There’s the classic vinegar, as well a chilli crisp oil that deserves to be studied and a ginger and scallion umami source which I want to bathe in. They also sell bamboo steamers if you need one.They even offer a VIP Dumpling Program where they’ll mail you packets every month if you want, which is a truly spectacular idea for which they deserve to make a fortune. —David Mack
 


Tomato pieI had never heard of tomato pie until this summer. If you had asked me if tomato pie was a thing, I suppose I would have said yes? I don’t know. Life before tomato pie is all a blur. Here’s what I remember: going to a farmers market on the way home from a weekend at a rental upstate, being overwhelmed by the produce selection, and almost doing what I always do when overwhelmed by farmers market produce, which is buy some token non-produce item (a baked good, honey, soap) and leave, but then my husband said, “What if we buy a bunch of heirloom tomatoes and make a tomato pie?” It was such a sure-footed plan, offered up as though we had ever made a tomato pie before, that there could be no response but to buy those tomatoes and make that pie. I would provide a recipe, but I actually just googled around and cobbled together a few. The gist is this: You cut up the tomatoes and drain them a bit, you layer them in a pie crust with basil, and then you top it off with a mozzarella/mayonnaise mixture that doesn’t taste mayonnaisey once you’re done. Then you bake it. It’s basically like a fresher, tomato-first take on pizza, and it’s the best possible solution to late-summer farmers market decision fatigue. —Sam Henig
 


The Ooni Koda 12-inch pizza oven — $319 at Williams Sonoma, BloomingdalesI lusted after this pizza oven for several years before I finally bought it, and when I did buy it, it was as a Christmas gift for my dad. But playing with his forced me to pony up for one of my own. It was just too good.Here’s why:It gets really hot — 950 degrees hot. There are things for which a regular household oven is simply not hot enough, and they are where the Ooni shines.It does more than pizza! Throw in a cast-iron skillet with broccoli, or asparagus, or brassica steaks, or actual steaks, and you’ll have a fantastic meal ready in just a few minutes. Seriously: There are so many applications here. Kebabs! Naan! Branzino!The pizzas are fantastic. Truly better than any I’ve had at a restaurant. Your edges will get a bit singed, and that is not bad. I prefer a quick prebake of the crust (with continuous rotation for an even bake) before adding sauces and toppings. For an unconventional but delicious white pie, roast a big head of garlic, mash it, and whisk it into a bechamel with some fresh sage. Sub this for the tomato sauce and top with your choice of veggies. —Emily Baker-White
 


Ayako & Family Hanabi plum jam — $16 at Ayako & FamilyI choose to believe that jam can be classified as tech because my body is a machine and food makes it work. This summer, I was expecting to make up about 50% of my food intake with fruit. But for whatever reason, I couldn’t get the fix I needed; almost all the stone fruit I ate was grainy and tasteless, not at all the sunshiny flavor I craved. So I decided to make up for it with fancy jam in the fall and winter. When I say fancy, I mean that this stuff is $16 a jar. But Alessandra Gordon, a second-generation jam-maker, makes the headiest preserves from plum varieties I’ve never heard of. This jam is not at all too sweet; one spoon of the rich, dark Hanabi Plum jam on yogurt tastes like something I’d pay $15 for at a really, really nice brunch place. It’s basically saving money. Plus, once you consider that the company’s base wage is $18 per hour and the staff is all people of color and/or queer, the price feels more than right. —Estelle Tang
 


Anova steam oven — $599 at AnovaMy wife tersely refers to the Anova Precision Oven as “another of your unnecessary kitchen gadgets.” And yet, she has eaten, with great gusto, the cooked-to-perfection focaccia I’ve made in it. She has also eaten the baguettes I made in it during a baguette marathon that had me baking bread every two days for over a month. And that pork shoulder slow-cooked for 12 hours in a sous vide steam bath? She ate that too. Same thing with a *shockingly* good pizza. So sure, it’s unnecessary, and yes, it is perhaps reckless to spend $599 on an oven that cooks with steam when you already have a real oven. But steam makes for better bread crusts, and cooking sous vide gets foods at the perfect temperature pretty much without fail. And this thing kind of does it all — air-frying and baking, included — and it does it well, and you can run it from an app on your phone. If my kitchen and bank account were both larger, I’d probably buy one. (Anova loaned BuzzFeed an oven to review.) —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Honey-Can-Do herb preserver — $12.69 at AmazonAfter years of watching cilantro and basil rot in the fridge, I finally broke down and bought an herb preserver. My husband and children were highly skeptical, but the cilantro was fresh and green a full TWO WEEKS later. I enjoyed fresh cilantro on three separate dinners (if you’re wondering: guacamole, butter chicken, Vietnamese tofu, and pork). It fits perfectly in the door of the fridge, and at only $13, it’ll pay for itself in a couple of months easily. —Dao Nguyen
 


The Original Baking Steel — $119 at Baking SteelLook, I am fully aware of how ridiculous it must seem to be endorsing a $119 kitchen gadget that is essentially a piece of steel plating pulled off an aircraft carrier, but this thing has proven to be an incredible ally when it comes to baking bread, pizza — anything with a crust, really. The Original Baking Steel is just that — 16 pounds of it. And because steel retains and conducts heat more efficiently than other materials, it can pizzeria the hell out of your kitchen. The Baking Steel’s creators claim it can function as the “equivalent of a 900° wood-fired oven despite being in your 500° home oven.” I have no idea whatsoever if this is true. What I can say is that the bread and pizza I have cooked on it definitely looked and tasted like it, which is all that matters, really. —John PaczkowskiOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

I’m Australian, so I’m used to “shrimp on the barbie” and “a dingo ate my baby” jokes. I’ll even laugh politely if you gesture at my cutlery and say, “Call that a knife?” But this year, a new Aussie gag entered the fray, courtesy of the internet. Instead of the usual Steve Irwin impressions, my American friends started ribbing me for the simplest and most unexpected particularity: the way I pronounce the word “no.” Apparently, I say it “naur”; if I’m being really feisty, I say it “naurrrrrrrrrr.”In 2021, “naur” became a meme, thanks to the alchemical meaning-making of the internet. Viral tweets and TikToks spread the joke like Vegemite on toast, and before long, it was appearing in places Crocodile Dundee himself never ventured. In April, video footage of a gigantic outdoor swing went viral — you can hear a person loudly saying “no” in an Australian accent — when someone retweeted it with the disbelieving caption “i cant they really say ‘naur’ LMFAOOOO.” Various “naur” jokes ensued: “Naur” became a topic of conversation on Botched. Fans of the musician Mitski dubbed her hit song “Naurbody,” and people imagined what it would be like to get a marriage proposal rejected Down Under. (This joke about Normani — I won’t spoil it for you — is my favorite example.)In another timeline, the joke would have ended there, relevant only to Australians and people who like to be mean to Australians. But it didn’t.
 


Even before “naur” became a main character on social media, people were attempting Australian mimicry online. Actor Brian Jordan Alvarez got attention last year for his shockingly on-point version. TikToks riffing on an antipodean kids’ TV show called H2O: Just Add Water made the rounds a couple of years ago, making fun of how the performers pronounced one of the characters’ names: not Cleo, but Cleourrrrr.Suffice it to say, the algorithm was primed for further iterations. One of the earliest viral “naur” tweets was this, a proto-Joycean tragedy in miniature from 2020 about Iggy Azalea. “Iggy is in the house crying like naur....naur.... naur carti naur,” it reads. Like many online artifacts, it is almost impossible to understand without additional context. When I called its author, 24-year-old fashion consultant Chris Bridges, they said its popularity was “really random.” Bridges had dashed it off in the early hours of Christmas Day last year after seeing a tweet by the Australian rapper criticizing Playboi Carti for apparently choosing not to spend the holiday with their son. “I was just, like, bored in my house, trapped with my family. I really wanted to go out. So I was just on Twitter, drunk, tweeting,” Bridges said. “I tweeted it and I went to sleep. And I woke up the next day, and everyone was laughing.”Bridges wasn’t the first to popularize the spelling; they had seen it on Tumblr. Their tweet was a dig at Azalea and her accent, but they said they’d had some practice because of an Australian friend they like to rag on, albeit in a more loving way. “We make fun of her accent relentlessly,” they said. “Saying weird stuff she would say. I kind of got hooked on the way she would say ‘no,’ like, naur. It really sent me.”In June, Chicago-based comedian Seynique Smythe tweeted a photo of n, a, u, and r Scrabble tiles. When I DM'd Smythe to chat (“naur,” she responded at first, swiftly following up with “jk”), she said that the photo came from a real game she’d played. Her hand had made her “desperate” — when she saw the letters, she thought to herself, Can I play this? But the reason the meme had resonated at all was a pop culture reference. “I used to love the Australian show Saddle Club when I was a kid and I remember there was a character named Lisa who always said ‘no’ like that,” she said. “So when I first started seeing the meme around, it stood out because it was like, ‘OMG, other people have noticed this.’” Advertisement  
 


Typically, when people who aren’t Australian attempt the accent, they don’t do a very good job. This has resulted in horrid interpretations, like those in the “Bart vs. Australia” episode of The Simpsons and Robert Downey Jr.’s in Natural Born Killers.But the Australian accent isn’t uniform across the country. Sydney-based dialect coach Victoria Mielewska has worked with Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, and Elisabeth Moss on perfecting their Australian diction. “Australia is such a melting pot — there are so many different accents. It's hard to actually say [any] is the absolute one,” Mielewska said. But generally speaking, there are common elements that are difficult to imitate yet tempting to lampoon. As former director of the Australian National Dictionary Centre Bruce Moore laid out in the 2007 book Talking and Listening in the Age of Modernity, they include a nasal quality, flat intonation, and a drawl.“If you're British or American, a lot of your accent is based on musculature in the mouth,” Mielewska said. “They're very muscular accents. When you go into Australian, you really relax the tone and the soft palate. So it's actually asking [non-Australian] actors to undo what is inherent and habitual with their own accent. And that's why it's so hard ... you have to have a certain amount of vulnerability, and allow that exposure of this new accent to come through.” Advertisement  “Naur” is an unusual instance of non-Australians actually managing to sound Australian, albeit in an exaggerated way. So what accounts for the way Australians say “no”? Mielewska said the word actually “has a fairly tight musculature” compared to other Australian-accented words. To get “that unique Australian sound,” she said, the lips round toward the end of the word, and the tongue bulks up to make that “r” sound. Her tips for nailing it are to put “no” and “ur” together, stretching out the sounds, and not to stay on the same note throughout the word. “Be definitive about it,” she said.Crystal Abidin, an associate professor of internet studies at Perth’s Curtin University, said that online jokes about Australian accents have been around for much longer than, say, TikTok has. “[The letters] ‘n’ and ‘o’ becoming like a 12-letter ‘no’ was definitely one of the viral things I saw on Australian Tumblr from as early as 2008, 2009,” she told me. “But I would say the mainstreaming of Australian vernacular, in general, really took off internationally on Facebook pages.” One category of early Facebook memes compared Australia to other countries, usually in a self-deprecating way. “Like, ‘China has Phoenixes; we've got bin chickens.’”
 


The repository Know Your Meme recognized “naur” with its own entry in July 2021. According to Google Trends, “naur” hit its peak online in late September. While the accent jokes kept coming, “naur” began to be used on its own, as a cartoonish, emphasized version of “no.” How did it make the jump? As linguist Gretchen McCulloch puts it in her 2019 book Because Internet, a meme “isn’t just something popular, a video or image or phrase that goes viral. It’s something that’s remade and recombined, spreading as an atom of internet culture.”In this case, “naur” spread further still thanks to K-pop fans who noticed that stars like BlackPink member Rosé and Stray Kids’ Bang Chan and Felix, who all have Australian roots, pronounced it that way. “The ‘naur’ meme has received a lot of acknowledgment, reciprocity, and feedback from the K-pop stars themselves,” said Abidin, who added that BlackPink members have used it playfully with each other during interviews. All of this has the effect of entrenching it as part of the relationship between fandom and stars. “It absorbed into K-pop, transcended fandom, and is known by the stars too, which really has a major effect in disseminating the visibility of the meme to a larger, broader international audience as well.”Now, it basically seems to be an accepted word for Gen Z on TikTok and Twitter. That probably wasn’t an organic outcome, Abidin said. “It is often the case that on platforms, especially like Twitter, this kind of meme that has only a very niche social capital becomes a mainstay of the platform, even if nobody understands it. It goes out of its silo, takes on a life of its own, and it becomes ingrained as part of pop culture in general. And this has to do with K-pop fans strategically trying to groom algorithms into registering what they do as trends.”I’d dreamt up a theory, shoddily constructed around the cultural prevalence of Hemsworth brothers and K-pop stars like Rosé, that the accent was coming into its own. But maybe not. Unfortunately, it seemed like my accent had become part of the landscape not, as I’d hoped, because of some global agreement that the Australian accent was a mellifluous joy, heretofore unappreciated, but because 1) people were making fun of it and 2) there had likely been a concerted digital effort.Embarrassed about the wishful thinking, I figured that I was predisposed to think fondly of the meme mostly because I was an expat, nostalgically pining for the sounds I grew up with. But it had also seemed to mark some kind of change in how other people saw the Australian accent. It used to be the butt of the joke rather than something that could bring a bunch of different people together, and this was the first time I could remember non-Australians using it to communicate and laugh with me, rather than just wielding it at me.Were locals enjoying the gag as well? Abidin reminded me of the concept of “cultural cringe,” an all-Australian skepticism toward homegrown cultural products, which might well apply to a joke that made fun of the way most of us talk.But according to Michelle Rennex, a senior writer at Australian culture website Junkee and one of the first people to cover the “naur” meme, that wasn’t the case. “No Aussie is actually offended by anyone coming up to us and saying ‘naur,’” she told me via email. “The good thing about Australians is that we know how to take a joke.” Rennex said she loved the meme; her favorite iteration is this reference to the Saw movie franchise. “I often make my accent extra thick to get my point across. It’s common for Australians to make fun of the different types of Aussie accents. But while we might not all normally say naur in such a thick accent, there’s definitely a trace of naur in all of us.”Honestly, I love “naur.” It may seem bizarre to contemplate it so seriously, but I really do think about it all the time. Maybe that’s because it is so ridiculous, an utterance that instantly clears my brain and turns me into an Australian Girl Doll: no thoughts, just naur.Yet it’s obvious why this otherwise trivial meme has stuck with me all year. I live in New York and thanks to the various travel complications caused by COVID-19, I likely won’t see the Southern Hemisphere for some time. I’m homesick and grateful to have my national identity recognized and played with while I’m so far from home, even if it’s because of something as quotidian as the way I speak. “People enjoy listening to it, and people are fascinated by it,” Mielewska told me, before she said something that made me feel really happy and, well, heard. “It’s welcoming, it’s open, it’s personable. I think people really warm to the Australian accent a great deal.” ●

Many days it seemed like just making it to the end of 2021 was the ultimate life hack. These are some of the tips that got the staff of BuzzFeed News through it. From the best place to buy jumpsuits (Old Navy, seriously), the Peloton coach that got us through it (Jess King), the sublime experience of keeping a dream journal, or just….

Peloton coach Jess KingThree days into my Peloton trial and about 10 minutes into a ride that was clearly way too difficult for me, I was seconds away from giving up. And then, I swear to you, at the very moment I was going to step off the bike the instructor, Jess King, looked me dead in the eyes and said something like “Don’t you DARE. Don’t you dare give up. You can do it.” I don’t know why, because I am typically cynical about things like feeling the person in a workout video stream is speaking to me, specifically, but I listened and stayed on the bike. And I did do it. And six or so minutes later, when King told me to lean to the right if I was going to puke, I did that, too. That was more than 50 pounds ago. And while diet and mindfulness had a lot to do with me getting healthy, so did Jess King. Because she kept me biking, daily. How did she do that to an older guy in the worst shape of his life? Distraction. With the exuberance of a trick-or-treating kid in their best costume ever or the happiest person at a rave, King is fantastically, endlessly distracting — with or without the live DJ that sometimes accompanies her. She rides the bike like it’s a horse and her steady stream of direction is encouraging and surrealistically instructive. “Pretend you have gills in your armpits!” “Nipples over knees.” “Breathe through your back.” “Oops, I meant add 5.” “Here comes the shitshift!” And, yes, “Puke to the left.” She is the only coach who consistently makes me forget about my own discomfort long enough to keep exercising regularly. And to be clear, the discomfort is real, because King is a very good trainer — she’s just giddy and comfortably ridiculous enough to distract you from it. —John Paczkowski
 


Getting rid of your carAfter I moved to LA, I acquired a collection of business cards and notes that people left under my windshield wipers or in the driver’s window that basically said, “hey your car is a dump, let me buy it.” Then I moved to a neighborhood notorious for having the worst possible street parking in the city, and my problems escalated. My catalytic converter was stolen. Then I paid a lot to replace it and cover other repairs. Then, about a month later, it was stolen again. Then I paid a lot to replace it again and cover more repairs. Then I installed an anti-theft mechanism, surrendered, and handed the keys over to my dad and let him drive away with it.I bought my bike for $200 on Craigslist a decade ago and have probably spent five times that much on upkeep since then, which is still a fraction of how much it cost to own a car. I’d already relied on my bike for most trips, and the car had become redundant. I was only moving it once a week to repark and avoid tickets on street-sweeping days.I figured ridding myself of this turbulent beast would simplify my life. And it has. Now everything I own on this planet is inside my little shoebox apartment. I immediately stopped paying for gas, for parking, for tickets, for oil changes, for brakes and tires and catalytic converters, for Geico, for the AAA membership, for the little sticker on the corner of the license plate. But it’s also made getting groceries a drag. And getting anywhere takes a little longer when you’re on bike and public transit. And I’m rolling up to dates with helmet hair and drenched in sweat. And, without a trunk or backseat to store things, I’ve had to embrace being a Backpack-Wearing Adult.It’s complicated things, but it’s simplified things. I’m tethered to the city, but I’m liberated. —Emerson Malone
 


Telfar medium shopping bag — $202 on Telfar (sold out, but $150–200 on Poshmark)The Telfar medium shopping bag is perfect. Many people have extolled Telfar’s virtues and you don’t need me to go into it here, but what I did not know was that the medium bag is the perfect size. It somehow fits absolutely everything I need for all possible situations: my laptop, my water bottle, the old Glossier bag I throw my toothbrush and face wash into when I go to my boyfriend’s place, the giant copy of Dune I for some reason take everywhere with me lately, a bunch of old disposable masks I forgot about — you name it. The handles and straps mean it can be worn or carried in a bunch of different ways without killing my shoulders and/or neck, and it somehow goes with everything I wear. I’ve never really been a purse girl, but I’ve been converted. I haven’t touched my ratty old tote bags once since this baby was delivered. —Addy Baird
 


Getting full coverage car insurance — $XX/month (varies obviously) from HagertyI purchased a classic car in full almost two years ago while we were all stuck at home and public transportation was frowned upon. When I first got it, I was in a rush to get it onto the road and only insured it for liability. In the back of my mind, I knew I should probably get better coverage but kept putting it off. A few months ago, the East Coast got hit with the tail end of Hurricane Ida and experienced extreme flash flooding. My car was supposed to be safe at my mechanic’s, but it turned out that his shop was in an area susceptible to flooding. Long story short, all of his and his customers’ expensive classic cars were destroyed — except for mine. My car just so happened to be on the lift that evening. I took that as a sign to get full coverage because I don’t think I’ll get that lucky ever again.

Homefield Apparel shirts — $32 at Homefield ApparelNot that anyone needs to wear college-themed apparel any more than we already do here in the US of A, but Homefield Apparel has a lot of great retro or retro-appearing logos on T-shirts for a variety of colleges (including, for example, the Naval Academy, North Carolina A&T, and Rice — it’s not just Alabama and Michigan, you know?). The T-shirts themselves are not the sturdiest I’ve ever owned and will run you more like $30 a pop, but they look great and are extremely soft, and frequently the first I reach for when going for a T-shirt. These also fall squarely in the “good gift for sibling” territory, if your sibling is looking for, say, George Washington dribbling a basketball in a ’90s style, or the LSU tiger dunking one. It’s also semi-interesting to compare different schools and get a good sense for which are needlessly tight with what kinds of uses of their branding they’ll allow. —Katherine Miller
 


Old Navy jumpsuits — $30–44 at Old NavyI’m not ashamed to admit that I’m the person that’s usually two to three years behind the curve. So, it wasn’t until this year that I discovered I absolutely adore jumpsuits. My gateway outfit was a hand-me-down from my mother: a neon pink jumpsuit, covered in light pink starfish, that she bought on a family trip to Hawaii in the early 1990s. Since then I’ve gone all in on the fad, most recently buying a couple of styles from Old Navy as a self birthday present: the smocked cami jumpsuit for women in a leopard print and Breathe On cross-front sleeveless jumpsuit for women in purple. (Note that the patterns available are constantly changing.) It’s not uncommon for me to wear both of these, perhaps more than once, in a week. They are soft, flattering, and, of course, have pockets, making them the go-to outfit for walking my daughter to daycare, sitting at home in front of my computer, or meeting work colleagues for drinks at an outside bar. —Zahra Hirji
 


Keeping a dream diary — $24 for BuzzFeed News’s notebook from AppointedMost of my dreams are innocuous and forgettable; these are the ones where I’m reading Slack and scrolling through Twitter, and it hurts my feelings that this is the best my nocturnal imagination can do. But sometimes there are the surreal stream-of-consciousness ones that mold my entire day. Not just the ones where my molars are falling out, but the ones where I’m skateboarding around the White House and running through an unbelievably beautiful meadow and babysitting a gross alien creature. That’s why I started keeping a running doc in my Notes app simply titled “weird dreams lately,” dedicated to the more twisted yarns, which are always a genuine delight to revisit. Advertisement  Chuck Klosterman wrote, “People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they'd never admit in normal conversation. It’s a way for people to be honest without telling the truth.” So if that’s the case, what do I do with these:Nov. 26: Woodward and Bernstein are standing arm in arm on an elevated platform in a nightclub and singing something to the effect of “I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends / It’s always one of them gotta be ugly.”Dec. 11: An earthquake. The foundation of my condo’s building was tipping dramatically toward the street. I was holding onto a table for balance. The cats, Puck and Toby, were freaking out. Puck was standing on his hind legs trying to grab the air with both paws. All we could do was laugh.Dec. 21: I was performing in a play at my middle school at my current age. All the actors started to go off script. I got too comfortable and said the word “motherfucker” and everybody went silent and stared at me.Feb. 2: Someone kept using the phrase “that’s like putting braces on a scorpion.”Feb. 19: Dad and I visited a space museum run and operated by Mike Myers. We watched a video about efforts to extract petroleum on Mars and the voiceover sounded a lot like Dad. He wouldn’t admit that it was him. I asked Mike Myers who did the voiceover and he said it was Dad. —Emerson Malone
 


PigletsOut of all my attempts at mid-pandemic rejuvenation and despair mitigation, visiting a local farm with a bunch of piglets was by far the most effective. Piglets are a lot like puppies in that they are small, cuddly, and curious. But because they are pigs, they are arguably better. Their diminutive grunts and oinks? Their pristinely pink little noses and tiny ever-spinning tails? How ferociously, soothingly adorable. And how gently they pluck a piece of apple from your fingertips! It’s sort of the pig equivalent of a friend’s baby holding your finger. All this stuff makes a visit with piglets a killer pandemic poultice, an experience that will leave you giggling and obliterated for at least a few hours of the 18 months of the miasma of horror, idiocy, and anger we’ve all been living through. —John Paczkowski
 


Fabric face masks — $32 at BagguI struggled for so long to find a mask that not only fit my face but felt cute! These masks have a flap that covers your mouth, chin, and nose so they’re great for glasses wearers, too. I get so many compliments when I wear these! —Nicole Fallert Advertisement  
 


CheekfaceYou know those TV episodes where the plot can’t be resolved because one catastrophe leads to another? It feels like we’ve been stuck in one of those for half a decade, with the finale being isolation from friends and family for almost two years (The dumpster fire got bigger, now we need a bigger dumpster and a book of matches). But with the pandemic easing, I've been trying to get back to being human, and what's been helping me do that is the band Cheekface. (Here, let me explain how breathing works: You suck in and you continue to live).The LA-based trio of Greg Katz, Amanda Tannen, and Mark “Echo” Edwards specialize in tight, talk-sung indie tunes of wry hopelessness and hopeful wryness (It’s your best life if it’s the life that you’re living right now). With their two LPs (2019’s Therapy Island and 2021’s Emphatically No) and a smattering of singles, covers, and B-sides, they balance the boredom of living while the world burns and the joy of simply existing (Sometimes I wonder if there's a single good thing on earth. And then I eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch.).In early October, I was in a (masked, vaccinated) crowd indoors for the first time since the pandemic started, to catch Cheekface when they swung through NYC. It was a needed, personal reminder that crowds don’t have to be a threat. They can be a balm. (I liked it better when you were standing next to me.) —Brandon Hardin Advertisement  
 


Tarot cards — $17 at AmazonOne of the joys introduced to me this year was a new deck of tarot cards I received as a gift from a good friend. We sat on her sofa and each thought of something going on in our lives, drew a card, looked up its meaning, and thought intently about what it reflected about our personal state of affairs. We’ve all just quietly gone through so much in the pandemic. The answers, of course, lay in our interpretations, and the tarot cards can be a vehicle for self-reflection more than anything else. As we come out of a year spent in partial isolation, it was just more fun to do it with an old friend, laughing together and cheering on each other’s realizations made through a beautiful deck of divination cards. The answers we seek all lie in us anyhow, we just need some help getting to them, and a reminder that we’re not alone. —Venessa Wong
 


Used furniture from AuctionNinja.comAuctionNinja is an online estate sale auction site. It’s kind of like eBay, but with items grouped by individual estate sales, so typically a whole house’s worth of furniture and or other belongings. It’s a massive pain to buy stuff there, because you have to pick it up — in person — at a specific time window at the actual house over that weekend, or you forfeit payment! But because it’s such a pain, the prices…. My god, the prices.... They are just sublime.I moved this summer and needed some new furniture. My personal style has always been for vintage or thrift stuff, and with the supply chain issues happening I was hearing horror stories from friends waiting months for a West Elm couch to arrive. I paid under $1,000 for two matching couches in great condition from a fancy home in Greenwich, Connecticut (a friend helped load and move them). This is a site I almost hesitate to recommend because I don’t want too many people to find out about it and jack up the prices. It’s an amazing bridge between the random stuff on Facebook Marketplace/ Craigslist and a curated antique shop. —Katie NotopoulosOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

An Omicron-fueled coronavirus surge in places like New York and Miami have cities across the US scrambling to avoid similar fates as the federal government ramps up its own testing infrastructure. Experts, though, warn it could already be too late.The Omicron variant now makes up an estimated 73% COVID-19 cases as of last Friday, according to data from the CDC released on Monday. That’s up from 12.6% the week before and just 0.7% two weeks ago. Advertisement     Federal COVID-19 case data collected by University of South Florida epidemiologist Jason Salemi show the sharpest percentage increases in weekly cases were in Florida and Hawaii, two states that saw early Omicron outbreaks; Omicron caused 80% of the cases in Miami last week. Both the mayor-elect of Pittsburgh and the mayor-elect of Atlanta reported they tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday.“This spreads so fast that if you look at what's going on today, it's actually already happened 10 to 14 days ago,” said epidemiologist Salim Abdool Karim of the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa, who spoke at a Harvard Medical School briefing on Monday. “Time is not on your side.”With the world already grappling with the delta variant, scientists are racing to understand how the rapid spread of Omicron could affect the global health crisis that the pandemic sparked in March.
 


The CDC is calling for people to get vaccinated or boosted, wear masks indoors, and test themselves before attending holiday gatherings. But the increased demand is posing challenges.In New York City, where Omicron already accounts for 92% of cases and case numbers are breaking records every day, residents wait in line for hours and scour pharmacies for rapid tests. Denver and Miami also saw long lines for tests on Monday, and Daviess County in Indiana ran out of tests this weekend.Other parts of the country are trying to avoid this disaster. Cities such as Baltimore and Washington, DC, are giving away free tests in libraries. Seattle has opened a testing site at City Hall, and Santa Clara County, California, nearly doubled appointments at its largest testing facility this week, to 3,500 a day, and anticipates going as high as 5,000 a day.“A very common question I’ve been hearing is about family gatherings, especially in the weeks ahead,” said viral variants program coleader Jeremy Luban of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. Luban said testing is one of the most important ways to keep these gatherings safe, after vaccination. That makes testing centers and affordable at-home tests essential this holiday season.President Joe Biden on Tuesday laid out a plan to contend with the highly contagious new variant, including opening federally run testing sites in New York City this week. Advertisement     “I know you’re tired, and I know you’re frustrated,"" Biden said in his speech. ""We all want this to be over. But we’re still in it. This is a critical moment.""The new push will include moves to make testing more accessible to Americans, providing supplies and military medical personnel to hospitals, and setting up federal vaccination clinics, senior administration officials told reporters on a call on Monday evening.
 


The federal government has 500 million at-home rapid tests, which people will be able to access for free via a website — but not until January, administration officials said. Those are in addition to 50 million tests the administration announced earlier this month as part of its winter COVID-19 plan, before the widespread emergence of the Omicron variant.New federal testing sites will be opened in the coming weeks “based on where states and communities have pressing constraints and where the state and local public health officials request our assistance,” a senior administration official told reporters on Monday. Advertisement     The White House’s approach is based on the expectation that hospitalizations of unvaccinated Americans will increase in the coming weeks, and that COVID-19 cases across the board will rise.At the local level, public health officials are adding staff to testing centers and planning to open shuttered or new sites ahead of the wave. “Our work on Omicron is really kind of doubling down on the things we know work,” said Chris Hoff of the DuPage County Health Department in Illinois, speaking on a National Association of County and City Health Officials podcast. ICU capacity is already down to 20% in the county of 1 million people in the western suburbs of Chicago.
 


In Vernon, Connecticut, COVID-19 testing resumed in November, with steadily increasing demand since then, city communications specialist Dave Owens said. The city has also started giving booster shots, 446 last week, after pharmacies couldn’t keep up with demand.Michael Purcaro, the town administrator and emergency management director, told BuzzFeed News that Vernon has seen a 200% increase in demand for testing within the past few days. Normally, one of the city’s testing centers sees about 50 to 60 cars in an afternoon, but a few days ago, it saw 375. Advertisement     “The surge is here, and we expect it to continue for at least the next few weeks,” Purcaro said. “At least that’s what we’re planning for from an operational standpoint both in testing and vaccination efforts.”Mike Estramonte of StarMed Healthcare in Charlotte, North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that since June, his organization has planned to open dozens of winter testing sites able to see 800 to 900 people every hour and return results within two days. “It wasn’t until really the last three or four days that we’ve been staffed up to handle what we’re experiencing now and most people are getting in and out of our lines in less than an hour,” he said.The test centers will be open on Christmas, Estramonte said, adding, “COVID doesn’t take a vacation.”Nationwide demand for tests has steadily increased since early November, according to the US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey. “We also see more people reporting that they have COVID-like symptoms or that they know someone who does — those numbers are now about as high as they were during late August and September,” Carnegie Mellon University statistician Alex Reinhart said.
 


Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of COVID-19 tests: antigen tests, which look for molecules (called antigens) that are viral signatures, and more accurate PCR tests, which identify actual viral genes. Advertisement     ""The tests that are now available, the point-of-care antigen tests, are not as sensitive as the PCR test,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Anthony Fauci said on NBC's Meet the Press. ""But if you do them sequentially, one or two or more, you're going to get a result that would be an accurate result.""The arrival of Omicron also makes the availability of at-home tests more important than ever, experts said. “I wish everyone in the United States could be provided with a batch of free self-tests they could use at home,” Salemi said. “Things are changing very quickly with Omicron — it’s not really good enough to test 48 hours before travel — I’d test right before I walked out the door.”However, at-home COVID-19 tests run about $10 a pop; reimbursement requires filing a claim for the 150 million Americans with insurance, under the current Biden plan.“Unfortunately, these tests remain too costly and hard to find right now,” Stanford University School of Medicine’s Joshua Salomon said in an email, “so the extra layer of protection they provide remains the privilege of people, like me, who have been able to find and afford them.”

The smashing success of Marvel’s latest superhero vehicle, Spider-Man: No Way Home, had two of our critics curious: Is it actually any good?Turns out, they vehemently disagreed. But sometimes that’s more fun, right?Below, Shannon Keating and Elamin Abdelmahmoud hash it all out: Is Tom Holland’s Homecoming trilogy a welcome expansion upon the existing Spidey-verse, or just a depressing cash grab? What can millennial nostalgia tell us about the Tobey Maguire–helmed series, which kicked off nearly 20 years ago? Does the deployment of the multiverse in No Way Home actually make any sense? And, finally, should you see it? Advertisement     Elamin Abdelmahmoud: In Toronto, where I live, new COVID restrictions due to the spread of Omicron require movie theaters to refrain from selling popcorn, candy, and drinks. Which is to say: They require movie theaters to refrain from selling joy. So what would make anyone go to the theater under such unfulfilling conditions? This weekend, the answer was Spider-Man: No Way Home. Audiences turned up in droves for the movie, helping it pull in the third-biggest opening weekend of all time worldwide, and the second-biggest of all time in the US. That’s not a pandemic-era record. It’s an all-time record. I was among these people. I put on a fresh KN95 and settled in for what I was sure would be a lesser movie experience. But it was not.No Way Home, reportedly the conclusion of Tom Holland’s tenure as Spider-Man (or…is it?), is one of the most satisfying entries into the franchise, perhaps second only to Into the Spiderverse. That’s because of its sheer scale and ambitious plot — in No Way Home, Holland’s Peter Parker attempts to fix the consequences of his actions through a time spell from Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), but his plan goes terribly wrong when the spell becomes unstable and starts pulling in Peter Parkers/Spider-Men from alternate universes (aka Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man) and all the villains they’ve fought, too.Describing a film as “satisfying” can read like shorthand for “fan service,” which has become a lazy way for franchises with big, passionate fandoms to elicit excitement without putting in the effort to write films that offer something unique. No Way Home does deliver big fan-servicey moments — when Garfield showed up, there were audible gasps in the theater — but the devastating emotional center of the film makes it far more than a simple play on nostalgia.In this iteration, after Holland’s Peter suffers a catastrophic loss, the multiverse Spider-Men show up not just to help him on his quest but to redeem themselves, too. By the time we meet Maguire’s Peter, he’s a Spider-Elder who has reckoned with his Spider-Doubts and found purpose. Meanwhile, Garfield’s Peter is rudderless and lonely, having lost himself in his Spider-Duties. These two Spider-Men share touching moments (“No, you are amazing, and I need to hear you say it,” Maguire’s Peter says to Garfield’s; Garfield’s Peter can’t quite get there, but he’s overwhelmed with gratitude to be seen). Together, all three Peters unite to resolve the central question that the previous movies have been circling but not quite answering, which is: What is Spider-Man for? Ultimately, the answer is a poignant and simple one: to help us understand and better deal with grief. That’s why No Way Home is good, actually. Shannon, what do you think? Advertisement     Shannon Keating: Totally agree that Spider-Man is about understanding and dealing with grief! But I’m not sure I agree about how well No Way Home deals with those themes.After watching No Way Home this weekend (in Mexico City, where COVID cases are currently decreasing), I went home and binged the three Tobey Maguire iterations. The first, Spider-Man, came out in 2002 (!!!!) when I was 10 years old. Almost 20 years ago. Wild. Those movies are obviously big millennial touchpoints; Maguire will always be my Spider-Man, I think. There’s a certain grittiness to the trilogy that I appreciated even as a kid.Spidey’s origin story is a dark one, but before my rewatches, I had forgotten just how dark. In Spider-Man, when Peter holds his murdered Uncle Ben’s hand, it’s not a beautiful or poetic moment; Ben is grimacing with pain and anguish. It’s pretty horrible. Then we have all of James Franco’s daddy issues with the incredible Willem Dafoe — my introduction to both actors were their roles as Green Goblin and son Harry Osborn — and the unhealthy and eventually murderous ways Harry channels his confusion and his grief.The Maguire movies are also lovely tributes to New York City. Spider-Man doesn’t just save New Yorkers; New Yorkers have his back, too. In the first movie, a proud and rowdy group rains detritus upon the Green Goblin when he’s trying to kill Kirsten Dunst’s Mary Jane and a cable car full of people, one of them yelling, “You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!” In Spider-Man 2, after Spider-Man stops Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) from plunging a subway train into the river, he passes out from exhaustion and the passengers gently lift him into their arms, set him down, and promise not to reveal his identity — his mask had come off during the fight. Advertisement     This is all to say that I didn’t get a lot of those big, emotional beats from No Way Home, even with that one significant and sad death. I’m sure my millennial nostalgia is a part of that — an unwillingness to accept this new version of an old, beloved character. But I don’t know, man.First off, No Way Home is just…doing a lot. The multiverse is a fun concept, and it’s cute to see all these different Spider-Men united in brotherhood, but I think I preferred it when Spider-Man hewed closer to that gritty New York realism. No Way Home, though it does have its darkness, feels very Disney: shiny, wholesome, sexless.
 


This could just be a me problem, but the logic of the movie also escaped me. When Holland’s Spider-Man is trying to rehabilitate the villains from other worlds, I couldn’t stop thinking: Why are you making gigantic, fundamental changes to universes that are not your own??? We all know how tweaking things in time and/or space can have disastrous consequences! What’s going to happen when these men who were supposed to have died go home and are alive and, I guess, also nice now? Holland’s Spider-Man says multiple times throughout the movie that these guys are not his problem, which we are supposed to judge as callousness, because his Aunt May and the movie overall insist that they should be his problem. But why exactly is that the case, especially when the other Spider-Men have already dealt with them sufficiently back at home? I guess it’s a bummer that they had to die in their original universes, but as Dr. Strange says, that’s their fate. Leave the complications of other universes alone! Advertisement     That brings me to my confusion about what the movie is trying to say about being a good person, which I’d love your thoughts on, Elamin. I found it pretty goofy on both a thematic and practical, logistical level that all the Spider-Men could create perfectly calibrated antidotes that would turn their respective villains back into regular men, at which point they would seemingly be worthy of redemption. While I appreciate that idea, and would be very interested to see more superhero movies take on ideas around justice and restitution — especially if we have to live in a world where most movies are superhero movies, ugh — I felt like No Way Home handled it all so clunkily.Something I admired about 2002’s Spider-Man is that the Green Goblin wasn’t evil just because he accidentally zapped himself with jacked-up superpower juice or whatever. Norman Osborn was already a power-hungry capitalist, making oodles of money by providing the military with horrifying weapons of mass destruction. He was also an asshole patriarch who was sexist toward Mary Jane and emotionally tortured his son, which in turn led to Harry’s own descent into supervillainy. This is a bad guy! Who dies, remember, in a botched attempt to murder Peter.Not to say that Norman isn’t deserving of restorative justice — I think we all are, supervillains included — but still, it felt pretty reductive to erase these specificities in favor of promoting the idea that all the bad guys were only or mostly bad because of the way they acquired special powers. Superhero movies work best when they’re allegories for our real-life structural problems, and No Way Home’s kumbaya approach felt kinda basic and bogus to me. I know this is a movie for children, but still!EA: OK, not only is it a movie for children, it’s also a movie about children — I’m really compelled by the way that Holland plays the idealism of Peter. His “I can fix it” attitude, his desire to just resolve the matter in the simplest way (“Let’s just make the bad guys good!”) is the most kiddish thing about him, and that’s what drew me in. In his world, he’s trying to apply the morality lessons of helping everyone, and he immediately realizes he can do that with the technological tools he has access to — tools that perhaps the other Spider-Fellas didn’t. And what’s more, they work. He’s seen evidence of this. Changes to other multiverses be damned, there’s good to be done here! Advertisement     That’s not to say this viewpoint isn’t challenged — he suffers some serious consequences for trying to maintain his little-kid attitude and his Pollyannaish energy, and he’s faced with a personal crisis. I mean, Holland is ready to kill in this film, before the Spider-Elders offer their perspectives and bring him back from the edge.What unites all the Peters is that moment where they rally around the idea of great power/great responsibility. They realize they all have this in common, but it applies differently in each of their lives: Maguire realizes that his angst over the responsibility that he’s been given is not for nothing; Garfield concludes that he is his Spider-Brothers’ keeper; and Holland realizes that there is a cost to his idealism, but it is worth preserving.One thing that I think is elegant about this film is the way it handily settles the debate between who is the “best” Spider-Man by saying: Actually, all of them deal with different tragedies, and you can’t compare them but you can resolve them, so each finds some closure.SK: You’re totally right that Holland’s can-do Peter feels appropriate, especially due to his age! As much as I didn’t love this movie, I am a little bummed that Holland’s time as Spider-Man is allegedly coming to an end — I’m genuinely curious to see how his idealism would evolve over time. Advertisement     The Spider-Elders hyping each other was obviously fan service, in a way that probably would have delighted me more if I were more of a real fan, as opposed to someone who isn’t that attuned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But I do really like that idea, Elamin — that this movie is weighing in on the debate about who’s “best” by sharing the love.OK, OK, I’m starting to give the movie more credit than I did initially. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend people who aren’t MCU fans drop into this one — especially in our era of Omicron — but catch it on an airplane in a few years? For sure. ●

President Joe Biden once again urged Americans to get vaccinated and condemned anti-vax misinformation on Tuesday afternoon, as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads rapidly ahead of the holidays.The president said that unvaccinated people have “good reason to be concerned,” while those who are vaccinated and boosted are far less likely to be hospitalized or become seriously ill. Advertisement     While telling vaccinated Americans that they should not panic, Biden addressed the 70.6 million Americans who are completely unvaccinated on Tuesday in strong terms, telling them that their choice not to get the shots “can be the difference between life or death” for anyone they have contact with.“Your choice is not just about you. Your choice affects other people. You're putting other people at risk, the loved ones, or friends, neighbors, strangers you run into. Your choice can be the difference between life or death. The longer the virus is around the more likely the variants from that may be deadlier than the ones before.”Biden also directly cited former president Donald Trump, who told supporters on Monday that he has had a booster shot of the vaccine, despite having driven anti-science rhetoric and downplaying the pandemic during and after his time in office.""I got my booster shot as soon as they were available, and just today former president Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on."" Advertisement     The White House’s plan to contend with the crisis involves increasing federal support for overrun hospitals, making testing more accessible to Americans, and increasing vaccination resources.Biden went on to blast the spread of misinformation on social media and conservative cable television, where anti-vax rhetoric has thrived throughout the pandemic.“Look, the unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media,” he said. “You know these companies and personalities are making money peddling lies, and all that misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters. It's wrong. It's immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now.”Biden said 1,000 military medical personnel will be deployed to help hospitals around the country cope with an increase of COVID-19 patients, and that hundreds of ambulances and staff will be available to transport people from overcrowded hospitals to medical facilities with open beds.“I don’t think anybody anticipated that this was going to be as rapidly spreading as it did,” Biden said, responding to a question on Tuesday about whether the government failed to prepare for how quickly demand for tests has increased in recent days.The federal government has purchased 500 million at-home rapid tests, which people will be able to order online starting in January, the president said, in addition to the 50 million they announced earlier in December as part of their pre-Omicron winter plan. Federally run testing sites will also be set up, starting in New York City this week, and expanded to other parts of the country where local health authorities request assistance.Biden plans to continue using the Defense Production Act to assist manufacturers in producing COVID-19 tests to keep up with demand.“We should all be concerned about Omicron, but not panicked,” Biden said in his speech.“The best thing to do is to get fully vaccinated and get your booster shot,” he said. “And no, this is not March of 2020. Two hundred million people are fully vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more.” Advertisement

“HE DIED FOR HIS FREEDOM”FLUSHING, QUEENSNEW YORK CITY — Overcast skies quickly transformed into heavy rain as Hurricane Ida made its way up the Eastern Seabord on the evening of Sept. 1. Hongsheng Leng and his family took shelter in their basement apartment in Queens.The National Weather Service blasted out cellphone warnings about life-threatening floods, but in English and Spanish only — to get public alerts in other languages, people had to actively enroll in local programs.Around 9 p.m., the flooding forced the maintenance hole covers near Leng’s house to erupt like small geysers, one bang after another echoing through the street. Homes on the ground floor of Peck Avenue were soon under 4 feet of water; their basements were filled. People trapped outside climbed on top of cars. Police waded through the area, asking if anyone needed help — but in the night’s chaos, no one came for the Lengs. Advertisement  Leng and his family were among a growing community of Chinese Americans excluded from the “model minority” myths — stereotypes that Asian people in America are upwardly mobile, quiet, and unaffected by racism — that often dominate political discussions. Instead, they are part of a population of immigrants who arrive in America as adults only to find that the systems in place to help people out of poverty weren’t designed for them.With limited English skills and professional credentials that carry little weight in their new country, they have limited work options and often end up accepting off-the-books jobs; these positions leave them ineligible for unemployment benefits and force them to start from scratch near the bottom of the income ladder. Having spent years of their lives working in their native countries, they lack sufficient 401(k)s and pensions that allow people to retire comfortably. They bring with them no inheritance to keep them afloat or to jump-start their children’s path to upward mobility. In a country where savings accounts and emergency funds are largely dependent on employment history and generational wealth, there is little to cushion their fall through America's tattered social safety net.In New York City, a quarter of Chinese immigrants live in poverty, according to the city’s calculations — a rate comparable to that of other Asian communities in the city and elsewhere in the country. Assumptions that Chinese immigrants and other Asian diasporas thrive in the US are not merely false but damaging; community advocates say the model minority stereotype is part of the reason predominantly Chinese neighborhoods receive a disproportionately small slice of the government funding meant to support lower-income households.The result is a human toll in plain sight but often overlooked in the world’s richest nation. An older immigrant couple collecting cans to survive as a wave of hate crimes sweeps their adopted country. A middle-aged man working under-the-table jobs until the pandemic hits. An enterprising son whose entrepreneurial ambitions only set him back. Grandparents waiting in line at a food pantry discussing their dreams for the next generation. A promising student who gets into a prestigious high school but struggles to get ahead. A reunited family living in a basement apartment that fills with water when the storm hits. Advertisement  Leng, a college-educated architectural designer and painter, was already in his 50s when he arrived in the United States on a temporary visa 26 years ago. His wife Aihua Shen and their daughter Ling remained in Wuhan. He overstayed his visa and became out of status (meaning he entered legally but remained illegally), presenting him with the same employment challenges facing the more than 100,000 undocumented Asian immigrants estimated to live in New York City.Leng had a dream of opening an art gallery in the US and did not want to face the shame of returning to China unsuccessful, his brother-in-law Libin Shen said. Years passed. Ongoing health problems, which required several major surgeries, ruled out jobs in restaurants and other positions that were physically demanding. And Leng spoke little English. Over the years, he got by on odd jobs, selling his art on the street and picking up gigs at a graphic design firm. In 2004, he applied for asylum, claiming that his political activities with the Chinese Democratic Party in the US made him a target for persecution if he returned to China.A decade later, his wife and daughter joined him. They made a home below ground, in one of around 50,000 illegal basement apartments in New York City, the country’s most expensive rental housing market.
 


The family occasionally scavenged to get by. A neighbor said Leng collected bottles and cans and tried to repair and sell electronics; the neighbor was irritated when he scattered unsellable items and broken parts in front of other people’s homes. Financial struggles were not rare in their neighborhood, Flushing, one of New York’s Chinese enclaves. In Leng’s zip code, where more than 70% of residents are Asian, 1 in 4 Asian residents lives below the federal poverty line. Many are Chinese, who make up about three-fourths of the Asian population there.City records show anonymous complaints were made about the building the Lengs inhabited, for which six violations were issued. The most recent complaint, filed in 2007, indicated that the building’s garage and basement had been illegally converted into apartments, but inspectors were unable to access the property. The complaint was closed after two inspection attempts. EW Escrow, the owner listed for the property, did not respond to a request for comment.Libin Shen said his sister Aihua wasn’t forthcoming about their circumstances. “She never told us anything negative when she was in America. She always said everything was fine,” he said. “Had I known about her living condition, as her brother, I would have immediately asked her to come back.”On Sept. 2 at 11:42 a.m., after the rains receded, police responded to a 911 call. Emergency responders found a basement apartment without the requisite second exit. The two-family house had been converted into a seven-family residence, according to Department of Buildings records. A man and two women were discovered unconscious and unresponsive inside the basement of the house. EMS pronounced them dead at the scene.Hongsheng Leng was 82 years old, his wife Aihua Shen was 65, and their daughter Ling was 31.
 


In China, the Shen family did not find out about their deaths until four days later, via a community organization in the US. Libin said he fell to the ground. He had heard a storm hit the New York area, but didn’t know the family lived in a basement apartment, and it never occurred to him they were in real danger, or that the city would have experienced what he sees as a breakdown in emergency services that night.Leng “had the freedom to go to the United States,” Libin said. “When I hear of the American dream, the only thing I would like to say is he died for his freedom.”Most of the 11 basement deaths from Hurricane Ida’s historic flooding were people of Asian descent, including Chinese, Nepalese, and Indo-Caribbean families.The Leng’s apartment was soon gutted, erasing the ruins of their lives in America. On the front door of the house, a faded sign remained bearing the Chinese character “fu,” meaning good fortune and luck.“A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK IS NOT GONNA CUT IT”HARLEM
 


Before the flood, Yao Pan Ma and his wife had lost their apartment in Chinatown to a fire. It had only been about a year since the couple left their children and grandchildren in China to come to the US in November 2018. With few options, they moved in with the wife’s older parents in a housing project in Harlem, a neighborhood where residents had faced the headwinds of racism and economic hardship for generations. When the pandemic shut down the city in March 2020, Ma, who had been a dim sum chef in China, lost his job in a restaurant in Chinatown, where he cooked and washed dishes.Ma, 61, had not worked enough to qualify for jobless benefits. His in-laws, who are in their 90s, receive less than $1,000 in combined Social Security benefits, but it wasn’t enough to support all four of them. “For four people, you can scrimp all you want, but at the end of the day a Social Security check is not gonna cut it,” Karlin Chan, a spokesperson for the family and community advocate, said.So in 2020, Ma and his wife began collecting bottles and cans to make ends meet, one five-cent deposit at a time.The pandemic hit recent Asian immigrants, as well as those with no college education, especially hard. In a country where retirement incomes are far more robust for those who work jobs with pensions or 401(k) plans, older Americans without such nest eggs rely on public programs that don’t always meet basic needs. Social Security payments, which are based on a person’s earnings history, penalize people who were low-wage workers or who arrived in the US later in life. The impact of this system on older people in Asian communities in the US is clear: Asian American and Pacific Islander men earn 14.5% less in annual Social Security income than men on average, and AAPI women receive 11% less than other women on average, according to Social Security Administration reports; 11.7% of Asian people ages 65 and older live below the federal poverty line, compared to 7.3% of older white people, according to census data. Advertisement  When the pandemic hit, reports of violent racism against people of various Asian ethnicities escalated. In 2020, an older Chinese man collecting recyclables in San Francisco was taunted, attacked, and robbed in front of a crowd of onlookers as someone said, “I hate Asians,” according to a video of the incident. A year later, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old from Thailand, died after being pushed. In New York City, 61-year-old Filipino Noel Quintana was slashed across the face on the subway, and then in Los Angeles, two people beat Korean American veteran Denny Kim while yelling “ching chong” and “Chinese virus.” In March, eight people, including six Asian women, were killed by a 21-year-old man in a series of spa shootings around Atlanta.Then on a clear, warm night, around 8:15 on April 23, 2021, Ma was attacked while out collecting bottles on 125th Street in Harlem. His assailant, a 49-year-old man, was recorded on video approaching Ma from behind and knocking him down. “I am not going to let you up,” the man thought, according to a statement he later made to police. He repeatedly stomped on Ma’s head until he lay motionless and bloodied. Medical personnel transported him to Harlem Hospital Center, where they found bleeding in the brain and facial fractures.The man arrested and charged for the attack, Jarrod Powell, said in a deposition that a “Korean” man and a “Japanese” guy had robbed and maced him. He suggested that one of them was Ma. He “did not provide any details relating to the description of the perpetrators of the alleged robbery other than that they were Asian,” according to court records. The NYPD counted the incident as one of 80 reports of anti-Asian hate crimes over the first three months of 2021. Powell and his attorney declined interview requests.
 


Ma remains in a coma. Ma’s wife, too fearful to continue collecting bottles, worked as a home health aide for a few months but is unemployed again. “She’s still in shock,” Chan, the family’s spokesperson, said.When Chan last saw Ma at the hospital, months of worsening dystrophy had turned the injured man’s body frail, nearly reducing him to “a mummy,” in his words. “His chances of waking up diminish by the day,” Chan said. “Every time I go visit him, this anger, this anger just wells up in me.”In early November, Ma was moved into hospice care. His wife still plays classical Chinese opera when she visits, hoping he can hear.Seeing the disappointments Chinese immigrants around him face every day, Chan said he couldn’t help but think about their predecessors who arrived in California 150 years ago, lured by rumors of gold mountains on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. “A lot of people, when they get here, they realize that the streets are not lined with gold, they’re lined with garbage and shit,” he said.“I THOUGHT I WAS COMING TO PARADISE”SOUTH BROOKLYN
 


Two years ago, a middle-aged man named Yu found himself in Brooklyn and squeezing out a living as a contractor with a Chinese-owned business doing home renovation. He earned about $100 a day, under the table, sometimes getting consistent gigs, sometimes working just one week in a month.Yu, his wife, and their daughter had arrived in the US in July 2019 after a 14-year immigration process. “I wanted to see what the rest of the world had to offer,” Yu said through a translator. “It was really a dream to see how things would go.” The family left the southern Chinese village of Toisan — where many people in earlier immigration waves had come from — for New York, where his sister was living.They settled into an apartment near Gravesend Bay. Yu and his wife took the one bedroom and their daughter the living room. Yu, already in his mid-50s, worked part time while his wife went through the state’s required training to become a home care worker. Their daughter stepped into New York’s public high school system, not speaking any English.They had barely settled in before the pandemic began. Yu — who wanted to only be identified by his surname, fearing consequences for working off the books during that period — quickly found he was ineligible for unemployment benefits as he hadn’t reported working by that point. His wife, who had just completed her training to start work as a home aide earning $15 an hour, quit the job as COVID killed hundreds of New Yorkers daily, worried she too would catch the virus. Her voluntary resignation made her ineligible for unemployment benefits. Their daughter attended school remotely, cutting her off from the social interactions that allow a person to adjust to their new home. Months would pass in which they rarely left the house. No one made any money. Advertisement  Financial stability can be tenuous for older immigrants like Yu. Many lack the generational wealth or even emergency savings to recover from an economic setback. To survive in the short term, many work off the books at the expense of benefits they’ll need to get by in the long term. Even those who report their income may find they are ineligible for public benefits they need like Medicare because they haven’t worked here long enough, according to a 2021 paper on older Asian Americans in Frontiers in Public Health. The pandemic has further split those who lacked the means to survive the upheaval from those who had the resources to thrive.Without income, the Yu family’s rent, $1,500 per month, was now unaffordable. Their sponsor, a retired family friend who agreed to be legally responsible for supporting them as part of their immigration application, has paid several months of rent for them. But without an income or access to government relief, the newly arrived Yu family did what all people in America do when there aren’t other options: They borrowed money. The Yus have no credit history, so the loan came from family. They spent as little as possible and ate free food distributed by the local public school.
 


When the city reopened, Yu’s wife returned to work six days a week as a home attendant for an older Chinese person, but it wasn’t enough to cover their expenses, let alone catch up. Yu also found work six days a week for a Chinese-owned window manufacturer.“When I first came here, I thought I was coming to paradise, but work is harder here,” said Yu, 58. “I didn’t have to work as many hours in China; both of us are working six days a week. It’s not what I expected.”Was life in America better in any way? “The air quality,” he said.Yu said he hopes to learn English, a pursuit that is difficult to make time for when you have just one day a week off. The city offers free English-language courses, but the programs do not have enough seats to meet the demand. Some programs have waitlists. Perhaps in time, Yu’s daughter, who is now 16, will help pull the family to where they imagined they would be. Like many other students learning English, she has struggled to keep up as the pandemic closed schools for most of her first year here.“We want our daughter to be like the phoenix and the dragon,” Yu said, “soaring to the heights.”“THE PROBLEM WAS ALWAYS THERE, BUT NO ONE TALKED ABOUT IT”CHINATOWN, MANHATTAN
 


The son of immigrants who had long carried an American dream, Patrick Mock grew up to become a businessperson. He managed a Chinese bakery and supplemented his income by going to trading card conventions, where he sells Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon cards. At 27 years old, he lives in the same tenement building in Chinatown he grew up in, where rent is $700 per month.He’s struggled like many young entrepreneurs, but with none of the family wealth that helps those who succeed.“My bathtub is still in the kitchen and my toilet is still in the hallway,” he said. The building, like other tenements in Chinatown, an ethnic enclave formed as a result of racist attacks and discrimination, is full of “glue traps and rat cages.”Though his parents had come to the US to provide a better future for the next generation, Mock said, “I’m still in the low-income bracket.”Mock’s father was a chef who traveled to Massachusetts for work and came home to New York one day a week. His mother worked at a daycare until she got breast cancer. He’s spent his life in lower Manhattan’s Chinatown, surrounded by people struggling to get by — from the older people who make ends meet however they can (some by selling the gambling vouchers casinos give to those who ride their shuttle buses) to the cashiers, cabbies, restaurant workers, delivery drivers, and home health aides who make up much of the city’s low-wage workforce. “The problem was always there, but no one talked about it,” Mock said.About six years ago, during his first year in college, he borrowed money from friends and family and sold some valuable trading cards to invest in Joy Luck Palace, a Chinatown restaurant. “My mom and dad didn’t have that kind of money. So I had to ask around,” he said. “You need credit. I don't have credit. How I got my personal loans was through friends and family.” Advertisement  “When you come from nothing, every opportunity you get to rise up, you try to take it,” Mock said.The plan didn’t work.When one of the business partners left the restaurant, Mock raised his hand to take over as CEO in 2018. But he soon found huge deficits on the books; the restaurant was out of money. Just months after he took over, utility companies came to shut off the gas and power during a lunch shift. That was the end of the business. The landlord and vendors came after him for payments. Then the workers sued the owners for unpaid wages.Mock was 24 — “young and dumb and naive,” he said. He was still in college and working a side job as a roadie for a DJ company when he was served the lawsuit. “I was scared out of my life,” he said. He couldn’t afford an attorney. He still had midterms and finals. The plaintiffs won by default when he and the other defendants didn’t appear in court. The workers said this year they still hadn’t been paid. Mock was also liable for the restaurant’s unpaid taxes.Mock still dreams big. “​​One thing about the American dream is they all tell you to ‘pick yourself up, dust yourself off,’” he said.Coming to the US was a decadelong journey for Mock’s father. He left China in the 1950s when the US still severely restricted immigration from countries outside of Northern and Western Europe. Instead, he traveled to Brazil and lived there for 10 years while some 30 million people in China perished in the deadliest famine in recorded history. He eventually became a naturalized Brazilian citizen in order to bypass the US’s restrictions and enter the country in 1964, just before the US opened up immigration to people from other regions. Mock’s mother came in the 1980s as the government made deeper cuts to social programs. Advertisement  When the pandemic brought everything to a halt, New Yorkers from Asian diasporas saw their unemployment rate soar to nearly 26% during the pandemic, the highest rate among all racial and ethnic groups and more than the overall rate of 20% for the city at large. One zip code that encompasses parts of Chinatown was excluded from a city loan program for low-income areas because it also covered the wealthy, predominantly white neighborhoods Soho and Tribeca — that Chinatown’s geographic adjacency to white neighborhoods was an obstacle for business owners seeking help seemed almost emblematic of the problematic perceptions of Asian Americans’ figurative adjacency to whiteness.Chinatown was economically devastated by the shutdown. Xenophobia caused by what then-president Donald Trump called “the Chinese virus” may have kept some customers away. People without jobs filled Columbus Park; some slept on cardboard at night. Laid-off restaurant workers from other cities trickled into Chinatown hoping to find new opportunities but found none.In the midst of the city’s gradual reopening, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the neighborhood in August 2020. Mock approached the mayor on the street, asking for “more hope, more confidence.” He wanted City Hall’s help closing off streets to cars on weekends to increase seating for outdoor dining, like in Little Italy, and adding decorative lights to help create a more festive environment. But in a moment caught on video, the mayor walked off midway through Mock’s emotional plea. This brief exchange triggered a local uproar — a sign of white America’s chronic indifference toward the people in Chinatown.Mock said the community has been coming together and finding other avenues of support. After securing funding from a private donor he met through Yuh-Line Niou, a member of the New York State Assembly, Mock has been distributing meals to people in Chinatown without homes. As high-profile hate crimes drew widespread attention to the plight of Asian communities, Google and the nonprofit Asian Americans for Equality also helped fund Mock’s efforts, including installing new lights on Mott Street, a historic corridor in Manhattan’s Chinatown lined with restaurants, groceries, and gift shops. Advertisement     As the pandemic pushed him to help the most underserved around him, Mock described being among today’s “donut hole class”: a large swath of working people who are falling straight through the middle of America’s safety net because they earn too much to qualify for public assistance. Mock views his setbacks as common in America, a place that has long drawn strivers willing to sacrifice for a chance at upward mobility. “It’s the land of immigrants,” he said. “We're all running away from something, wanting something better.”“WE ARE POOR AND WE ARE OLD”LOWER EAST SIDE, MANHATTAN
 


Not far from Mock’s tenement apartment, a long line had formed around the block outside of a food pantry near the Williamsburg Bridge by 10 on a warm September morning. Run by a nonprofit called UA3, the pantry serves up to 750 people per day, and almost everyone who lines up is an older Chinese person. Advertisement     One woman in the pantry line, Ge, 67, said she had just retired from her job as a home aide, for which she earned the minimum wage, $15 an hour over 27 hours per week. Twelve years ago, she was a rice farmer in southern China. Today in the US, she said, looking at the people waiting for food, “We are poor and we are old. That’s why we are here.” Like others who spoke to BuzzFeed News, she requested that she be identified only by her surname to protect her privacy. She is now trying to get by on the $540 per month she gets from Social Security as well as whatever help her daughter can offer. “I don’t even have enough to pay rent,” which is $900 per month, she said.Pantry volunteers work a fast-paced, nine-hour day hauling and unboxing heavy crates of food and pandemic supplies, such as hand sanitizer and masks. One of the volunteers, William Yu, lost his job at a community college during the summer and is recovering from a stroke. It’s harder to restart in your 60s, and Yu — who immigrated here five decades ago — is now dipping into his retirement savings to get by.
 


That morning, a procession of people — some with rolling carts marked with big corporate logos, resembling promotional swag, and some under hats and sun umbrellas — snaked down the sidewalk. Directly across the street, another line of mostly East Asian people wrapped around the block outside of a pantry run by Vision Urbana, a nonprofit that works with the area’s Latino and Asian residents. The mirrored lines kept moving through the day but never seemed to get any shorter.Some of the people using the UA3 pantry had come to the US in the 1980s, when China’s extreme poverty rate was above 80%; some came in the 1990s, when there were still some 750 million people in China living below the poverty line. Others arrived in the 21st century, as the country made a sharp turn and skyrocketed to become the world’s second-largest economy. But in a country of 1.4 billion people, millions were still left behind during this period of growth. Those who came to the US struggled without institutional support for people who come from rural areas and don’t speak English.The systemic failures harming immigrant families were clear early on to Sean Hong, a college student who is a UA3 cofounder and the son of the organization’s chair, Don Hong. He attended PS 130, a Title 1 school in Chinatown that serves a large number of students from low-income households and has an 88% Asian student population, according to federal data. Many of his classmates didn’t have computers or internet service, Hong said, so he and his father worked to raise money to buy devices for students who needed it.Another of the organization’s cofounders, Kin Wah Lee, 66, said she witnessed how institutional neglect harms immigrant communities during her 30-year career at the New York State Office of Mental Health. Patients who didn’t speak English were often misdiagnosed and held for too long in psychiatric facilities, she said. She cofounded the New York Coalition for Asian American Mental Health and urged the New York state government to meet the needs of immigrants from Asian countries. Advertisement     
 


UA3 has operated without any city government funding but obtained $10,000 from the Brooklyn borough president's office this year. Community-based organizations serving Asian Americans received just 1.4% of the city’s social service contract funding from fiscal years 2002 to 2014, according to the Asian American Federation, a research and advocacy group. AAF research and policy director Howard Shih said that language and cultural barriers contribute to a lack of awareness of public programs among many Asian immigrant communities, and that government outreach has typically been inadequate — perhaps in no small part because of false assumptions based on ethnic stereotypes. “We see the impact of the model minority myth on the availability of resources,” Shih said. “We have populations that need support and help.” Because of racist assumptions, he said, even when people do see signs of poverty, “they don't think of it as a widespread issue.”
 


This year the New York state budget included $10 million to combat anti-Asian violence and provide economic relief to Asian American communities during the pandemic — an influx of money that came after “decades of underfunding,” Niou, the state Assembly member, said in a statement. “Year after year, the AAPI community has been erased from the state budget.”One of the women in the pantry line, Chan, a perky 61-year-old, said she followed her son to the US five years ago and found work as a home attendant. She looks after two clients, one who requires 24-hour care three days each week. She gets paid for only 13 of those 24 hours because state law limits how many she can work in a day. “I only go home twice a week,” she said.Lum, an 88-year-old woman in line with a walker, said her family arrived in the US in 1985, but she and her husband and even their children struggled here. To help her kids get ahead, she spent the years watching over her five grandchildren. Lum and her husband now get $300 in monthly SNAP benefits. Their rent at the senior housing complex, which is subsidized, just increased to $300. The food pantry is essential for their survival. Like many other immigrants, she and her husband hope their sacrifices will serve as a stepping stone for future generations.“IT’S HOME”NEAR THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE
 


William Lam, 36, was one of the younger people in the pantry line that morning.Two decades ago, Lam was a student at Stuyvesant High School, a highly ranked Manhattan public school that is now a controversial symbol of the city’s unequal and racially segregated education system. The school’s student body is 72% Asian in a city where around two-thirds of public school students are Black or Latino. The majority of Asian students in specialized high schools come from low-income families, and the poverty rate among the specialized schools’ Asian students is higher than that of the overall student population in the city.Lam’s father owned a deli in Chinatown before he died of cancer when Lam was 2 years old. For the last 30 years, he and his mother — who worked as a home attendant and in school cafeterias — have lived in a housing project complex of 16-floor brick towers between the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges on the Lower East Side; 26% of residents in the development are Asian, according to the New York City Housing Authority. Rent for their one-bedroom apartment is $500 per month. Because their household’s income is low, they get a discount on their internet, phone, and TV plan, reducing their bill to $200 a month.High school was a difficult time for Lam. Classmates ""would throw paper at me,"" he said. ""They would throw chalk at me. And the teacher doesn’t do much.” He had an especially hard time in science classes. Then on Sept. 11, 2001, Lam was in gym class when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center just blocks away from Stuyvesant High School. “I heard loud noises, like airplane sounds. Fast. And loud. And a crash.” After the attack, he struggled academically and eventually dropped out. Advertisement     
 


These days, Lam occasionally works at a video game store but is supported mainly by $700 monthly payments of Social Security disability insurance, which he receives for reasons he asked not to share publicly.“It’s hard for me to find work,” he said.On an average day, Lam plays video games, catches up with friends, and watches Hong Kong dramas with his mother. “[My parents] wanted me to be happy,” he said. “They wanted me to graduate from school to get a job, of course. But there are a lot of things out of my control. Sometimes, I can’t fulfill their dreams.”Lam wants to open his own store but doesn’t have the money. His mother, who retired early after injuring her knees and is cared for by a home attendant, spends a lot of time in the apartment, where she can gaze at a nearby hospital and watch people walking by. “It’s home,” he said, adding that after 30 years, “it’s hard to imagine moving.” His mother is happy here, he said. “She said she is going to die here.” ●Jeremy Singer-Vine contributed reporting to this story.

KYIV — Falling snow clouded Marta Yuzkiv’s line of sight as she moved in formation with seven other fighters down a narrow road. Rifles at the ready and communicating with hand signals and whispers, they scanned their surroundings for the enemy stalking them in the nearby bushes.Then, without warning, an ambush came from behind the pine trees. A Russian team of saboteurs gunned down four of Yuzkiv’s comrades. She dropped to the ground. But within seconds, she was shot and killed, too. Advertisement     The fighters weren’t actually dead. The ambush was part of a series of war games held Saturday — on the grounds of an abandoned factory outside Kyiv — by veteran instructors overseeing a ragtag group of Ukrainian volunteers.Russia is massing some 100,000 troops and military equipment around Ukraine, possibly mobilizing 75,000 reservists to join them, and threatening its neighbor with another large-scale attack unless the Kremlin’s demands for the US and NATO to abandon support for Kyiv are met. And fighters like Yuzkiv fear they could soon find themselves engaged in guerrilla warfare with highly trained soldiers under Moscow’s command.“I know for sure that I will not leave Ukraine [if Russia invades]. I will not live under occupation. I will resist,” Yuzkiv, a 51-year-old doctor, wife, and mother of three who prefers gardening to unconventional warfare training, told BuzzFeed News. “I am a compassionate, empathetic person, but…” After taking a beat, she finished: “I would kill [to protect my country].”
 


The war games involving civilian volunteers demonstrate the lengths to which Ukrainians are prepared to go if President Vladimir Putin decides to attack. Such a move would be an attempt to alter the country’s increasing alliance with the West and could spark a land war of the likes not seen in Europe since 1945. A poll done this month by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that more than 50% of Ukrainians — some 20 million of them — are ready to resist in one way or another if Russia launches a new invasion, while more than 33%, or roughly 13 million people, would be willing to join in armed resistance.Thousands — from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv in the west — in recent months have joined the forces, which are composed of about 80,000 volunteers in 25 separate brigades, or one for every region of Ukraine as well as the country’s capital city. They gather to train one day each weekend.The fighters are civilians from all walks of Ukrainian society, including IT workers, bankers, doctors, taxi drivers, schoolteachers, shopkeepers, and more. They don hunting attire and mismatching uniforms from army surplus stores. Some of them wear sneakers better fit for the fashionable streets of downtown Kyiv than the battlefield. And not everyone has a working rifle. In fact, several wielded cardboard cutouts of Kalashnikovs at Saturday’s training.Technically, the forces fall under the command of the Ukrainian military, essentially making them part of the country’s reserve army. But that doesn’t mean the military provides them garb and gear, although officials have suggested that defense force troops could eventually be given arms from the country’s stockpile. For now, they are forced to purchase everything on their own.But what they lack in equipment, they make up for in determination.
 


Dmytro Ternovskiy, a 39-year-old physical therapist for the Kyiv Arsenal soccer club, is originally from eastern Donetsk but fled the Russia-controlled city for Kyiv in 2016. He told BuzzFeed News that he had seen firsthand how Russian warlords seized his city and brought death and despair to residents there. He joined the territorial defense force to help make sure the same doesn’t happen to Kyiv and because he was ashamed that he didn’t take up arms to fight off the Russians in 2014.“It was very embarrassing that I was not with [Ukrainian fighters] then,” he said.Ternovskiy is trying to make up for that mistake. He’s already spent nearly $4,000 USD on uniforms, a bulletproof vest, boots, an assault rifle, cartridges, ammunition, and shooting practice.Vasyl Hryhoryuk, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, has him beat. He said he’s put more than $10,000 into his own fighting kit, which includes an AR-15 assault rifle and a Zbroyar Ukrainian-made sniper rifle. “If the dudes come from [Russia] and try to tell me how to live on my land, fuck them,” Hryhoryuk said with an air of bravado as he showed off his AR-15.Hryhoryuk goes to a shooting range once a week and CrossFit and stretching courses twice a week. Every Saturday, he shows up at the abandoned factory grounds to train with his fellow defense force fighters in Kyiv. Advertisement     Hryhoryuk has some past military training; he was conscripted into the Ukrainian army in 2011, at a time when it was “wildly underfunded.”“Things are different now, These are professionals,” he said of Ukrainian soldiers. He hopes the defense forces will soon be as prepared and lethal.The Biden administration, NATO officials, and the central government in Kyiv have all said they don’t know whether Putin has made a decision to invade Ukraine for a second time since 2014. But the increasingly ominous messaging from Moscow has them all on edge. Intelligence has suggested that an attack could come in late January or early February when tanks would be able to roll quickly over frozen ground.In recent days, Russian officials have warned that Moscow will respond “militarily” if the US and NATO don’t back out of Eastern Europe and pull support for Ukraine — which officials in Washington and Brussels have said will not happen. On Tuesday, Putin clearly delivered that threat himself.“If our Western colleagues continue the obviously aggressive stance, we will take appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps,” he told Defense Ministry officials in Moscow. “Do they think we’re going to stand by and watch?”President Joe Biden as well as the UK and other NATO countries have either said explicitly or implied that they would not deploy forces to Ukraine if Russia invaded. Instead, as a senior Biden administration official told reporters Friday, they are prepared to enact “economic and financial measures, and we are prepared to consider a number of things that we have not considered in the past, and the results will be very profound on the Russian Federation, but I’m not going to go into details.”Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he wishes the US would be more explicit in what it’s willing to do so Kyiv would be better positioned to defend itself if an invasion came to pass. Advertisement     
 


“We know how to fight this war. Our soldiers have been fighting it for seven years,” Kuleba told BuzzFeed News in an interview last Tuesday. “But what our American and other partners can do is help Ukrainian soldiers fight this war. Which is strengthening our capabilities, supplying us with respective defensive weapons and military technologies now.”Specifically, he named American air defense and anti-missile systems as items topping Kyiv’s wish list.Ukraine’s army was demoralized and in miserable shape after decades of neglect when Russia invaded here in 2014. The country of roughly 40 million people had only an estimated 6,000 battle-ready troops. Volunteer battalions backed by oligarchs and crowdfunded by civilians filled the void but couldn’t completely repel the more powerful Russia-backed separatist forces.Today, Russia continues to occupy Crimea and control a swath of territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which are combined about the size of New Jersey. Separating them from the rest of Ukraine is a 250-mile maze of trenches and bunkers from which the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists wage a war of attrition that has killed more than 14,000 people since spring 2014.After years of Western help, Ukraine’s army is now one of the largest in Europe, boasting 255,000 active-duty soldiers, 900,000 reservists, and some 90,000 paramilitary members. Washington has provided $2.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine’s military over the past seven years, according to the White House. Among the types of assistance are Javelin anti-tank missiles, Humvees, communication systems, and counter-battery radars, as well as military training. Advertisement     But Ukraine’s army is still not strong and experienced enough to defeat Russia if Putin unleashes the might of his military, which has over 1 million active-duty personnel and powerful ground, navy, and air forces, analysts say.As part of its preparation efforts, Kyiv is testing air-raid sirens in the capital this week and reviving many of its nearly 5,000 bomb shelters, which include its central metro stations that were built on the orders of the Soviet leadership in the wake of World War II hundreds of feet underground. (The city also published a map showing the location of the shelters inside schools, spas, bars, residential buildings, and elsewhere.) The facilities could hold more than 2 million of the more than 4 million Kyiv-area residents for several days — but not long term.Ukrainian news outlets have published stories about packing survival bags. The independent Hromadske news site painted a scenario for readers in which “the Ukrainian armed forces are resisting, but the Russians are using aircraft, rocket-propelled grenades and [other heavy weapons]. The front line is rapidly approaching your city… What to do in such circumstances?”Stick tape to the window of your home to protect against flying shards of glass during artillery attacks, it said. And gather personal documents, cash, medications, as well as supplies, like bottled water, nonperishable food times, matches, batteries, flashlights, an ax, condoms, and more. Advertisement     And then there are the Territorial Defense Forces, made up of motivated and patriotic Ukrainians like Yuzkiv, as well her husband and oldest son.Training the fighters are some of Ukraine’s more experienced veterans. Among them is Serhiy Filippov, 60, who went by the call sign “Sedoy,” meaning “gray,” for the silvery locks that frame his grizzled face. He was a major in the Donbas Battalion, a volunteer fighting force that helped turn the Russian-backed separatist tide in 2014 and 2015.
 


“These guys are motivated. They come to learn and they are ready to be the first to die for this city,” Filippov said. But he wasn’t pleased with everything he saw.Yuzkiv’s group, who took part in the ambush scenario, he said, responded poorly and slowly. He then explained a better way to deal with a surprise assault that he learned while fighting Russia-backed forces six years ago. Advertisement     Filippov believes a new offensive from Russia is likely. “Putin gave his ultimatum [to the West] and it was rejected,” he said, adding that he doesn’t see the president as a man to retreat. “[Putin] must go further. It is very difficult to stop a car that’s moving.”If the Kyiv Territorial Defense Force fighters are ready and willing to fight in a new war, they hope they won’t have to.Oleh Steshin, 47, runs a small construction firm repairing the exterior of buildings and has expertise in ascending and descending large obstacles. He was born in Soviet Uzbekistan and has family spread around the former USSR, including in Russia.Russia’s threats of invasion bring up a deeply personal fear. He worries that someday he could be looking through the scope of his rifle and see the face of his brother, who lives in Russia and could be among the soldiers sent to attack Ukraine.“Can you imagine what that would be like?” he asked. “I try not to think about this. I really hope that he won’t be on the other end.”

Fiction
 


That So died so young and suddenly certainly adds to the eerie sense of promise and potential in his posthumous debut collection, but rest assured, So knew he was going to be a star and this collection proves it. From the first story about two sisters working at a donut shop and speculating on the customer who comes in late at night to a virtuosic screenplay rendering of a family wedding with secrets unearthed to the gut-wrenching final story based on So’s mother’s family history — the writing is electric and original. —Tomi Obaro
 


Those familiar with Rooney’s last two books, Normal People and Conversations with Friends — both since adapted for the screen, and both hailed as landmarks of millennial fiction (whatever that really is) — will find more classic Rooneyisms in Beautiful World: deceptively simple sentences that are a real pleasure to read, skinny, pale, and brooding characters figuring out adulthood in modern Ireland. This time, we meet Alice, a young Irish novelist, whose long emails exchanged with best friend Eileen reflect her anxieties and ambivalences about literary fame, modern culture, impending social collapse, and the role of religion in their lives.These emails, placed interstitially as chapters throughout the novel — which is otherwise written in a distant third person — are the only times we can really get in these womens’ heads. To some readers (at least, some of the friends I’ve had feverish debriefs with after we devoured the book), the emails are self-indulgent drags; I know at least two people who skimmed them. But I found the letters, loving exchanges between friends with (in typical Rooney fashion) major class differences and positionalities, to be lovely, moving, and even profound.To the extent the book is “about” anything, both Alice and Eileen have love interests; to me, though, they’re the least interesting bits. I loved spending time in Rooney’s characters’ heads — they’re frustrating and funny, petty and loving, fallible and human. —Shannon Keating
 


Though Swamy’s debut novel examines the lack of agency for mothers in 1960s and '70s Bombay — her protagonist’s struggles are equally relevant today. Vidya’s young life is defined by her mother’s mental illness and eventual suicide. Vidya’s mother was deeply unhappy with motherhood and the ways in which society controls women’s actions. After her mother’s death, Vidya vows never to have children and to devote herself to Kathak dancing instead. Dance feels like breathing for Vidya, but when she becomes pregnant later in the novel, she struggles with how to balance her art with motherhood. Swamy’s immersive and vivid writing comes across beautifully in Sneha Mathan’s narration of the audiobook. —Margaret Kingsbury
 


This novel follows a 9-year-old Syrian boy, Amir, who has washed up as the sole survivor of a refugee boat that sank near a small island. He’s rescued by Vӓnna, a local teenage girl, who seems to feel her own kind of displacement even at home. The chapters alternate between Amir’s life before getting to the island and the journey he and Vӓnna take toward safety. In a little more than 250 pages, El Akkad manages to write a book about family, masculinity, migration, language, humanity (or a lack thereof), and innocence. Every word feels essential, and every chapter is quietly devastating until you reach the novel’s conclusion, a chapter that I’m confident every reader will remember for the rest of their lives. The story is brutal but compassionate, one that humanizes migrants so often stripped of their humanity as soon as they become “migrants.” Advertisement     El Akkad is infuriating because his prose is perfect, and his characters are more vivid than some people I know in real life. It’s devastating and, at times, hopeful, and even when his characters act without compassion, El Akkad always rights the ship back toward tenderness. What Strange Paradise cements El Akkad as one of the best writers alive today: clairvoyant, heartbreaking, and exceptional. —Scaachi Koul
 


Although it’s been classified as historical fiction, when it comes down to the heart and soul of this beautifully written debut novel by Robert Jones Jr., it's a love story at its core. Jones explores the forbidden romance between two enslaved boys — Isaiah and Samuel — in the Deep South, who find solace and safety in one another, despite their circumstances and the negative forces trying to tear them apart. Darkness becomes their best friend — the only time when they feel secure enough to strip away from their reality and come together as one. Told from multiple perspectives, Jones seamlessly intertwines names and themes from the Bible with the merciless treatment of enslaved people to bring readers a story that’s equally uncomfortable as it is alluring. The multiple narratives can feel a little overwhelming at first, but it quickly becomes clear how these vivid characters and their various perspectives illuminate this tale. I appreciate how honest Jones is with his writing, because even during those graphic moments where I would’ve preferred to shield my eyes from the atrocities Isaiah and Samuel were subjected to, I ultimately knew how important it was for these truths to be told. It’s a powerful telling of a resilient love that will leave you starving for more. —Morgan Murrell Advertisement     
 


I nearly didn’t finish this book. Not because I found fault with the writing — Lockwood is a brilliant, hilarious, and truly original writer. But in mid-2021, when I first picked it up, I was interested in escaping the increasingly dystopian internet landscape, and I wasn’t sure if a fictionalized account of a woman achieving social media fame in something deemed “the portal” would offer me the kind of escapism I craved. Indeed, in the first half of the book, Lockwood’s narrator sinks further into the portal’s bizarro world of endless jokes and strange images as a dictator takes over and climate collapse looms. A little too on the nose for me! Advertisement     But just when I was about to set the book aside, something changed. The narrator receives two texts from her mother, asking her to come home — something has gone wrong with her sister’s pregnancy.What unfolds throughout the rest of the novel is nothing short of astonishing. Lockwood has fictionalized a true tragedy from her own family’s life, and the way she imbues her irony-pilled narrator with an ever-greater knowledge of what is good and right in true in an increasingly dark and chaotic world frequently brought me to tears. I’ve never read anything like it. —Shannon Keating
 


The poignant and poetic vignettes that comprise Somebody Loves You are at first startling in their interplay between fantasy and reality, but while Ruby’s child perspective may lend itself to the whimsical at times — and especially in the beginning — her narrative is steeped in the reality and traumas of life as a South Asian girl in England. When Ruby begins elementary school, she chooses to become silent, observing the world instead of letting her voice impact it. In Ruby’s small day-to-day observances, the reader sees a mother’s mental illness unfold, the devastating impact of a neighbor’s racism, and the fraught bond between sisters unravel and weave back together again. Lovely, funny, and heartbreaking, this liminal glimpse into a child’s life is unforgettable. —M.K. Advertisement     
 


In what might be a queasy premise in the hands of a less capable writer, Peters tackles the bogeyman of detransitioning and queer parenting in this thoughtful novel about an unconventional trio. Reese is a trans woman in her mid-30s who wants to become a mother and is feeling somewhat rudderless in a series of dead-end jobs with dead-end boyfriends. Ames, formerly known as Amy before he detransitioned, has just gotten his boss, Katrina pregnant. He reaches out to Reese, whom he dated before he detransitioned, to see if she might be interested in coparenting. It’s a premise that feels a little unbelievable, but it’s really a way for Peters to dig into the backstories of Ames and Reese, their relationships to themselves and their gender identity. Peters is so observant and shrewd about race, class, and intersectionality; she writes movingly about the ways sex can be used to disassociate. It’s a book I spent a long time thinking about after I read it. —T.O.
 


When an apothecary begins to secretly dispense poisons to help liberate other women who have been wronged by the men in their lives, things take a turn for the worse — that was the short synopsis I read about this book before officially diving in and it had me hooked! Once I actually cracked it open, it didn’t take long for me to become completely enthralled. Penner takes readers on an unforgettable adventure, traveling through time between the dark alleys of 18th-century London with Nella and her hidden apothecary shop to modern-day London with aspiring historian Caroline, who stumbles upon one of Nella’s old vials. While the story initially presents itself as a murder mystery, once you peel back the layers, it quickly unfolds into a tale of women reclaiming their agency and their sense of self. It was amazing to see women protagonists learning to put themselves first, despite the people they would have to leave behind in the process. The way the author weaves together the intricate historical details, while also remaining true to the social norms of those time periods, does not go unnoticed. The writing was compelling, fun, and with just the right amount of imagination to keep me engaged from beginning to end. —M.M.
 


It seems odd to call a book delightful when it tackles such decidedly undelightful topics: the pandemic, a ghost haunting, an indigenous woman wrongfully accused of a crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison, police brutality, the entire year of 2020. Yet this novel, with its spiky yet warm main character and homage to the world of bookselling and reading, is an utterly delightful read that doesn't shy away from 2020's misery and uncertainty. Much of the novel takes place in author Louise Erdrich's bookstore, Birchbark Books. When Tookie is released from prison after a much shorter sentence than she originally received, she begins working in the bookstore. She also reunites with the man who arrested her and the two marry. Shortly before the pandemic, a frequent customer, Flora, dies and begins haunting the bookstore, particularly Tookie. Flora was the kind of white woman who longed to be indigenous and frequently invented ties to the indigenous community, although she also donated to the community. At first, her ghost is content to wander amongst the shelves, idly flipping through books, but when the pandemic hits, the ghost becomes more sinister. Sentences in multiple forms play an essential role in the novel, from prison sentences to favorite sentences from books. While the novel does meander from its ghostly plot, the bookish odes and conversations, as well as Tookie's family life, are such a joy to read that the reader will hardly mind. The novel is likely to become the book to read about the pandemic. —M.K. (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")
 


In 2015’s The Sympathizer, Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize–winning debut novel, an unnamed spy documents the hypocrisies of the Vietnam War from his unique vantage point as a half-French, half-Vietnamese double agent. He’s embedded in a South Vietnamese operation based in California, while secretly working on behalf of the Communist North Vietnamese. After surviving torture in a reeducation camp, the spy sets sail for France on a refugee boat with Bon, one of his best friends and fellow South Vietnamese soldier, who doesn’t know about the spy’s Communist past.And that’s where The Committed picks up, as our unnamed protagonist joins Bon in a seedy drug-selling operation. In his spare time, he reads theorists like Fanon. Part action-packed thriller, part trenchant critique on myriad evils of imperialism, The Committed is an incisive and thought-provoking read. —T.O.
 


Mina, a physician who grew up in Beirut and is the trans daughter of a Syrian mother and Lebanese father, receives an invitation from a nurse friend to come to Lesbos to offer her medical and translation services. Her brother Mezan, the only member of her family she still speaks to, will meet her there as well. Advertisement     Written in short chapters and addressed to an unnamed acquaintance who, like Alameddine, is a gay Lebanese writer, Mina oscillates between her own memories: meeting her wife, Francine, her decadeslong estrangement from her family, and the stories of refugees on Lesbos. She meets a Syrian family whose wife and mother, Sumaiya, has advanced cancer and doesn’t want her children to know. Mina watches venal white volunteers ask for selfies and European journalists make racist assumptions about the people they interview. The refugee crisis has become the kind of slowly unfolding calamity that can invite a lot of overwrought trauma porn; Alameddine resists that temptation here, opting for nuanced and insightful reflections on ordinary people trapped in horrific circumstances often caused by the countries whose asylum they now seek. —T.O.

Like the best of Toews’ novels, Fight Night deals with weighty subjects — suicide, aging, illness, and mortality — with a keen sense of humor. Swiv, a spunky 9-year-old who has been suspended from school, writes letters to her absent father. The letters are mostly about her grandma, a chronically ill firecracker who loves to rile her daughter, Swiv’s mother, who is a struggling actor pregnant with a baby they’ve all dubbed Gord. When Swiv and her grandmother leave their Toronto apartment to visit relatives in Fresno, California, Swiv learns more about her family’s true fighting spirit. Like Toews herself, Swiv comes from a family of Mennonites, a minority Christian sect with strict gender roles for its dwindling populace. Her aunt and grandfather killed themselves and the shadow of that loss haunts both her grandmother and her mother, but they both cope, or fight as Swiv puts it, in different ways. As a narrator, Swiv is charming and hilarious, her grandmother even moreso. I laughed and cried reading this book; I can’t think of a higher endorsement. —T.O.

I think this is the essay collection I recommended the most this year. Miller, known primarily for his poetry, is just so smart and thoughtful and nuanced about all things, especially race and class and queerness. Experimental in form, his essays range from explorations of race and class in his native Jamaica to the surprising alienation of visiting Kenya and Senegal as a Caribbean man to the community of Black queer boys who he hangs out with in Kingston. Just a lovely, thoughtful read. —T. O. Advertisement     
 


An extension of the 2018 New Yorker essay of the same name, the book is part eulogy for her late mother and part love letter to Korean food and culture. Zauner (who fronts the indie-rock band Japanese Breakfast) writes with sobering clarity about her depression, her mother’s cancer diagnosis, and the food they ate together, with the titular Korean American supermarket at its core. She shares in elegant prose her experience growing up with a dual ethnicity and longing to feel at home; Oregonians, in particular, will enjoy reading about her upbringing in Eugene and her countless local references. It’s an evergreen tale of grieving, coping, and exploring the culinary palates that make up Zauner’s vibrant world. Like a home-cooked meal, this one should be savored. —Emerson Malone
 


It takes a talented writer to make a nonfiction book feel like a sweeping, multidimensional novel, but Keefe accomplishes it in his excellent Empire of Pain. Keefe, a New Yorker staff writer, follows the trail of the US opioid epidemic all the way back to the root, unraveling how one family caused massive amounts of heartache and destruction.It’s remarkable how Keefe is able to distill such a complicated story into one that really comes down to just a few people: the three Sackler brothers; one company, Purdue Pharma; and one drug, Oxycontin. In his telling, each brother is ambitious and hungry for attention and fame, but none as much as oldest brother Arthur, who Keefe paints as an almost maniacally ambitious man who set the stage for generations of his family to pursue money in the pursuit of literally anything else. Each subsequent cast of Sackler relatives, the cold and calculating Richard Sackler of the next generation, and the hypocritical and out-of-touch David Sackler of the next, shows how money and power can rot a family tree to its core. Keefe is able to so intimately describe each Sackler he profiles it almost feels like you are reading a transcript of their own inner monologues, a remarkable feat.Ultimately, this is a book about how a few misguided and greedy people can cause an outside amount of damage on the world and impact far more lives than they ever could have imagined. Isn’t that the perfect read for 2021? —Stephanie McNeal
 


In this memoir, Miller deftly tackles her life with Crohn’s disease while dissecting how the medical community treats people with chronic illnesses — especially women — and giving advice for those living with a chronic illness. Her writing moves from raw and sometimes grotesque bodily details to outrage at a US medical system that consistently fails the chronically ill and disabled community. Miller’s narrative is not that of a person who wants their story to be pitied. Rather, it’s an up-close glimpse into Crohn’s and the ways any body, not just Miller’s own, can revolt, and it’s a call for change in the medical community. As a reader with chronic illnesses, I found myself intensely relating to Miller’s impotent frustration at her body as well as her descriptions and advice about medical PTSD and the ways illness can trigger past traumas. —M.K.
 


When’s the last time a performance truly touched you? I mean, stopped you in your tracks, left your mouth agape, opened up your soul-type of performance? Abdurraqib, an occasional BuzzFeed News contributor, describes these euphoric instances of music and dance with such detail and elation, it almost feels like you’re listening to a friend pour their heart out about a night that changed their life. From televised dance marathons and blackface to Merry Clayton’s iconic background vocals on the Rolling Stones song “Gimme Shelter” to the Beyoncé effect, Abdurraqib not only speaks poetically of the impact these productions had on him, but also the historical and cultural significance they’ve played in society throughout the years. I found myself taking a deep dive on YouTube after every chapter, just so I could feel a slither of what he was chronicling. One of the most remarkable things about Abdurraqib’s love letter to Black performance is the unapologetic and brazen way he delivers his perspective while also dousing readers in the nuances of that same topic. And although art is subjective, he affirms just how liberating it can be.—M.M. Advertisement     
 


Radtke looks at the US’s unique brand of loneliness and the myriad ways we as a culture suppress it; it can weaken your immune system, make you hypervigilant, take years off your life expectancy, and perforate your reality. She considers what it means to be alone from an anthropological, biological, and pop cultural perspective; she asks what we can learn about longing and alienation from Emily Dickinson, Princess Diana, Don Draper, or Yayoi Kusama. The core American tenet of rugged cowboy individualism has unraveled into an epidemic of loneliness. The illustrations of Seek You are stunning, a complement to the sobering thought exercise in understanding one’s solitary position in the universe. —E.M.Read an excerpt here.
 


Donald Antrim’s newest memoir, One Friday in April, has stuck with me since I first read it earlier this year. With exceptional clarity and tremendous self-compassion, Antrim methodically recounts the moments that led up to committing himself to a psychiatric hospital for several months and the harrowing experience of trying to find the help he needed to bring himself back from psychosis, including treatments of ECT. It’s the clearest account of bringing oneself back from the brink of mental collapse I can remember. It’s also a masterwork of empathy. (Disclosure: Donald Antrim was my professor at Columbia University in 2009.) —Karolina Waclawiak
 


Chicago journalist Dawn Turner charts the divergent paths of three little girls — her younger sister Kim, her childhood best friend Debra, and Dawn herself — in this powerful memoir. Growing up together in a housing complex in 1970s Bronzeville, Turner is an ambitious student, while her younger sister Kim skips school and mouths off to their mother. Debra, meanwhile, is a class clown, who, as she ages, becomes more interested in partying and drugs. While Turner goes on to become an accomplished journalist, Kim, who has an alcohol addiction, dies of a heart attack at only 24, while Debra is eventually imprisoned for killing a man. How these girls — who grew up in the same building in a working-class neighborhood once famous for its Black luminaries but besieged by institutional neglect, violence, and drug addiction — had such different life experiences is the central question of this book. Turner provides no easy answers while passing no judgment. —T.O. (From “25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down”) Advertisement     
 


Albert Samaha’s Concepcion is probably the most satisfying first-gen immigrant memoir I’ve read in recent memory. As he reaches the age his mother was when she migrated to the US from the Philippines, Samaha investigates his mother’s beliefs that led her here, their family history, and whether a life in America was worth it after all. Samaha, who is half Filipino and half Lebanese, charts not just his family’s immigration story, but the story of countless others who came around that time too. Part-memoir and part-journalistic venture, Concepcion is both a time capsule about a family’s hopes and desires, as well as a history lesson for those who don’t know much about US immigration, Spanish colonialism, and the legacy of imperialism. It’s a personal story that only a reporter could write. (Full disclosure: Samaha is an editor at BuzzFeed News, and I also wrote a blurb for his book before its release.) Advertisement     The book is, at once, informative but approachable, heartbreaking but hopeful. It doesn’t matter where your family is from, where they ended up, or where you think you belong — Concepcion speaks to the inherently human desire to build something better. —Scaachi Koul (From ""25 New And Upcoming Books You Won’t Be Able To Put Down"")●

Nike Training Club app — free via NikeAfter a year of being noncommittal to exercising, I got serious and downloaded the Nike Training Club app (Nike made it free during the pandemic). It has hundreds of workouts, from yoga to strength training to nauseatingly painful cardio sessions, and you can go as hard or not as you want on any given day. The app also gives you “trophies” to mark milestones — three times a week, eight months in a row, Beast Mode when you’ve done five strength workouts, all of which means nothing except it may satisfy the part of your brain that craves reward. Blessedly, even 12 minutes of very light stretching is considered a full exercise on this app; when I had COVID, getting through that one was a tiny triumph for me, one that the app also acknowledged.Most importantly, Nike’s Training Club app has weekslong programs you can cycle through however many times you like, and you can feel how much stronger you’re getting the second, third time around. The app has self-care tips and healthy recipes, too, if you care about that kind of thing, but it’s best used as a workout app, not a lifestyle app. Advertisement  You may outgrow it after a year, maybe even before that. But if you’re thinking of getting serious about exercising, if you can only bear getting very sweaty in the privacy of your own home, and if you want a workout app that is good and FREE!!!!, I don’t think you can do better than this. —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


Weee — free at sayweee.comI live a decent hike away from the closest Asian grocery store, and while my local supermarkets are beginning to stock more and more of the basics I need, sometimes you need to go the whole hog. Weee brings “Asian and Hispanic” groceries to you and claims to be operational all over North America. I can't speak for that, but when the giant boxes of eel, scallop noodles, custard buns, and imitation crab arrived on my Brooklyn doorstep, I thought I would faint from happiness. The name is absolutely wild — founder and Larry Liu said it’s basically like the sound kids make when they're excited. I hope to never make that sound as an adult, but the feeling is there. —Estelle Tang
 


Seinfeld — $8.99 with Netflix subscriptionDespite my best attempts to live my life Seinfeld-free, I caved when Netflix brought on all nine seasons in October. Maybe I was bored, I was probably a little curious. But by “The Jacket” episode, something clicked, and, after years of declaring how boring and unfunny the few clips I was forced to watch were, I finally got it. Seinfeld is hysterical, it’s wacky, it’s even kind of raunchy??? These revelations shook me to my core. I’m not being dramatic when I say that of all the things I tried this year, Seinfeld is the one that changed me the most. My world expanded, I felt like someone whose life was full of possibilities, and I just can’t stop making slap bass noises now. —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


Peleton app — $12.99 per month (first two months free) at PelotonI don’t have a Peloton bike. I don’t have one of their treadmills either. But I do have their app on my phone, which I use at a gym much bigger than my apartment where both of those machines are available. Advertisement  The Peloton app is incredible. If you are someone like me who walks into a gym and just wants someone to hold their hand and tell them what to do, it’s a lifesaver.The sheer volume and variety of on-demand (or live, if you time it right) workout content is extraordinary. There are workouts set to every genre of music invented and set around specific artists. There are workouts for beginners and advanced athletes. They have strength workouts (arms, chest, butt, core) and running or cycling workouts (endurance, high-intensity intervals, tabata, hills). They have yoga you can do in the morning and meditations you can do at night. There are audio workouts you can run to outside if you are someone who hasn’t gotten sick of parks yet in the pandemic. There’s even a set of truly cursed workouts you can take on Sept. 11 when you want to run on a treadmill but also Never Forget at the same time.You won’t get the live stats or same metrics that the bougie bike owners do (although it can sync to your smartwatch), but you do get the same trainers and can thus participate in the increasingly prevalent conversations at parties where people gush about who their favorite is.Of course, everybody and their mom knows about Cody Rigsby. But did you know that Jess Sims is an even badder bitch and (unbeknownst to her) my best friend and will lead you through a 60-minute high-intensity bootcamp that will make you see the face of God? Or that Olivia Amato will be there for you on the days you want a small woman with demonic core strength to make you regret — for the duration of a 10-minute class — that you were ever born? Or that Matty Maggiacomo will run on a treadmill with you for 30 minutes and somehow be endearingly charming the whole time with not a hair out of place and will one day be my husband? No, you didn’t. But now you do. And so does he. —David Mack Advertisement  
 


Criterion Channel — $10.99/month at CriterionMy buoy through the last year has been the Criterion Channel, which has let me dig into decades of international cinema and which pound for pound has the richest and most rabbit hole–y library of any streaming service. Every time I open this app, dizzying horizons open up before me. I’ve gotten lost in Soviet sci-fi movies and French/Japanese/Czech New Wave and let time pass by with slow cinema from Belgium, Sweden, Iran, and the US.I wish it didn’t take a global pandemic for me to discover Nights of Cabiria (which woulda been great Halloween costume inspo had I thought of it before this moment) or The Seventh Seal (which whoops did not realize was gonna be a plague movie) or In the Mood for Love, but the last few months have just been lousy with new, beautiful discoveries.

Laundry TikTok — free at @jeeves_nyI fell hard down a TikTok hole of videos of a professional dryer cleaner showing how to get stains out of various fabrics. Zachary Pozniak is the charismatic face of Jeeves, a high-end dry cleaner in New York, and in these videos he shows you in dulcet tones how to get chocolate, red wine, or tomato sauce out of anything, and offers other tips like how much detergent to use or how to make your own stain spray. Have I used these techniques? No, I’m still too lazy to do a pretreat soak for my stains. But I did buy some wool dryer balls that he recommends using instead of dryer sheets. —Katie Notopoulos

It’s oddly soothing to watch someone who’s skilled with clippers create a flawless skin fade — buzzing off the back and sides of the head then meticulously blending it with the top to form a perfect gradient. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I like process videos. One TikTok creator, @12pell, is a New York City–based barber who specializes in Asian hair (particularly of interest to me because I’m a Filipino dude who’s been getting fades since he was a kid). Allow yourself to go down this rabbit hole. These folks are artists. —Richard Nieva
 


Audm — $4.99/month at AudmI listen to a lot of podcasts when I run. I love podcasts! But sometimes, they feel blathery and meandering and redundant, in a way that good writing never does. Sometimes, I want to listen to good writing instead of mediocre talking. And for that, there is Audm. Advertisement  I have run for hours through redwoods, happily distracted from my physical efforts by journalism from ProPublica and the New York Review of Books and the New Yorker and, yes, BuzzFeed News. Long car rides fly by when you’re listening to the Atavist. A Times Magazine feature is usually just the right length to fill the Saturday morning kitchen cleaning.This feels self-serving, because we are journalists — of course we think people should consume more journalism. But it’s an option that I think a lot of people don’t know they have! Remember, next time your favorite commentators start bloviating, you could be listening to their exquisitely edited words instead. —Emily Baker-White
 


Smartless podcast — free on SpotifyA friend had recommended this podcast to me a while ago but I refused to listen to it because I thought it would be another podcast of celebrities talking to their privileged friends. After all, the podcast is essentially Will Arnett, Sean Hayes, and Jason Bateman interviewing a mystery guest who is later revealed to be someone like Melissa McCarthy or Tiffany Haddish. But I finally gave it a try earlier this year and I laughed nonstop listening to Arnett make fun of his friend Justin Theroux's sleeveless T-shirts habit. Smartless makes you feel like you're joining a group of friends joking around with each other. It’s easygoing and fun and now I love Sean Hayes. —Eva Lee
 


The Libby app — free with a library cardThis free app lets you access ebooks and audiobooks through your local public library, making it effortless to accumulate more titles for your already mammoth TBR pile. BuzzFeed has plugged the Libby app a number of times already, but it is truly fantastic, so here we are writing about it again.While the Goodreads app will perpetually tell me that I’m five books behind my annual goal, the Libby app helps accelerate the reading process. The audiobooks download to your phone when you borrow them, so you don’t need to use data or a Wi-Fi connection to access the titles. In the last month, I’ve listened to My Year of Rest and Relaxation while on a long train ride, Annihilation on a bike ride in the wilderness, My Dark Vanessa walking around the city, The Underground Railroad on the subway, and Eating Animals reclined at the dentist’s office. —Emerson Malone
 


Department of Salad substack newsletter — free on SubstackThe Department of Salad is a newsletter by food writer Emily Nunn. It’s one of the rare, refreshing food newsletters that focuses on the love of the food instead of the personality of the food writer, and I love it. She interviews chefs and salad aficionados to get recipes from all different places — from a French salad from a New Yorker Magazine cartoonist to peach caprese, steak salad, to how to make that carrot ginger dressing you get on salad at the sushi place down the street. If you, like me, really only ever eat out so that you can steal the recipes of the place where you’re eating to make at home, then this newsletter is a voyeur’s dream into how to make the best salad of your life. —Pia Peterson-Haggarty Advertisement  
 


The Smoke Free app — free or $0.99 per week for premium at Smoke FreeAs of this writing, I can tell you that I haven’t had a cigarette in 8 months, 24 days, and 14 hours. And I feel fucking great about that. It was really hard. I quit cold turkey, but I did it with a plan that this app helped me come up with and execute. It can be a little cheesy at times, but if you too are motivated by earning little digital badges and completing challenges and logging things Smoke Free helped me a lot. And it’s kept track not only of how long I’ve gone without smoking, but how much money I’ve saved.As its name suggests, Smoke Free is free but you can also pay $0.99 per week for premium, and I really recommend doing so. The missions I got through premium every day in that first month really forced me to think through what I would do when I had bad cravings or faced a big trigger, like drinking outside with my friends. That’s what made the quit stick. —Sarah Mimms Advertisement     
 


Tribute.co group video card — $29 at Tribute.coWhen I got an email from a friend’s sister that she was asking friends to do a short video message wishing my friend a happy birthday, I was like, ugh this is going to be a pain. But you know what? It wasn’t. The sister was using Tribute.co, which is an app that makes it easy to collect a bunch of friends’ video messages and combine them into one nice longer video for the birthday girl (or whatever occasion).Sure, you could just email everyone and ask them to send you a video and edit it yourself together for free in iMovie. But you know what? That’s actually a huge pain in the ass. It requires nagging people who don’t understand deadlines and often getting people to understand things like Google Drive, which can be a total headache. Tribute.co manages all of this with an intuitive service that manages everyone’s uploads and lets you drag and drop them into a final video. It’s simple and great for a very lazy person comfortable with doing the bare minimum to celebrate a friend’s birthday. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Steezy app — $149.99/year subscription at SteezyI got bored of yoga apps during the pandemic but still wanted to move my body around. I love to dance, and am terrible at it — I have no coordination, left and right are a mystery, etc. The internet told me about Steezy, which has classes you can take from home, where you won't crash into other participants and might actually learn something. The programming starts out basic — and I mean BASIC, like shift-left-and-right, these-are-your-feet, this-is-a-beat basic, which is perfect for me, a grown adult. It’s pricey, but there are a LOT of classes on it for all kinds of dance activities so you can find what you like. —Kate Bubacz
 


Overcast.fm — free with ads or $9.99/year at OvercastApple’s podcast app has inexplicably sucked for years now. It is a nonintuitive asspain that almost seems intentionally bad by design. Overcast is the best replacement I’ve found for it. With a clean design and solid podcast management features, it’s easy to use and more importantly easy to set up and forget about. A premium subscription ($9.99/year in-app purchase) removes adds and unlocks additional features like the ability to upload audio files to your Overcast account. —John Paczkowski Advertisement     
 


Voice Intercom for Sonos — $1.99 at App Store or Google PlayWithin seconds of downloading this app, I was able to scare the shit out of my daughter bysaying “GET OUT” in my best Amityville Horror voice through a Sonos speaker in our living room. That alone makes this thing worth the purchase price, though I am sure there are many other uses for an app that lets you broadcast your voice through a Sonos system by speaking into your iPhone’s microphone. —John Paczkowski
 


Headspace — $70/year via HeadspaceI had been meditating for over three years without any guidance before I got this app. It was fine, I don’t believe there is any right or wrong way of sitting and breathing. However, after my 20 minutes of meditating, I frequently caught myself reflecting on how much of that time was spent thinking and not focusing on my breath. A friend told me about Headspace’s “Headspace 365” which has a new meditation for every day of the year. It had been working for him, so I thought I’d give it a shot! I’ve found that sometimes it’s quite lovely to have a guiding voice that helps me stay centered with my breathing and set good intentions for my day and life in general. —Derek Gardner Advertisement     
 


Forkist app — free via ForkistI struggle a lot with deciding where to eat. If I’m home, I can live off of rice, beans, and chicken, but whenever I have to make the choice outside, I take forever. I heard some college friends talk about Forkist and I downloaded it. It’s basically a food Instagram — literally just food suggestions and pretty food pictures. There are suggestions all over the country and the ratings are really easy to digest. I don’t post that much but I definitely enjoy seeing other people's quick reviews on food nearby. —Nicole Collazo Santana
 


Nike Run Club app — free via NikeYears ago, I downloaded the Nike Run Club app at the recommendation of a best friend from college who was on a thirtysomething *healing journey* that included therapy, yoga, and lots of YouTube natural hair care tutorials. I don’t remember what she said in her pitch for the app, but I do remember her talking about getting more in touch with her breathing, which sounded both mystical and a little corny. But I am easily influenced, so why not? I did my requisite handful of runs to my self-curated playlists loaded with high-energy, fast-octane hip-hop and dance music, bought a couple outfits to look cute as I did it, and then promptly quit.Fitness in general, and running in particular, always felt like a gesture toward another life rather than a commitment. And commitments were daunting. It took a pandemic for me to rethink commitment. Not as a goal unto itself, but a practice that can be as rugged and imperfect as the person who’s trying to do it.Pandemic life had forced a stillness on me that I found deeply unsettling. I was used to constant, aimless movement. Stillness forced me to reckon with everything I’d moved away from, and reconsider everything I thought I was trying to move toward. On a very basic level, I’d always wanted to become a runner, but was intimidated by the idea of running. I played sports in high school, but running was always the thing you did to condition your body for the thing you really wanted to do.As adulthood unfolded, though, I noticed that there was running and then there were runners. Runners had this magical way of moving and staying still at the same time. There they were, passing me by on Brooklyn’s Eastern Parkway, chins slightly leading their chests, thumbs resting on their middle fingers, eyes focused on a spot just ahead of them. They didn’t fight what their bodies were doing. They settled into it. They were patient. They looked calm and steady. They were, in a sense, still. Advertisement     June marked a turning point in America’s fight against COVID-19. Vaccines had arrived. Hope was on the horizon. For more than a year, my movement had been restricted by airborne pathogens and government mandates and my own endless anxiety. What would it mean for me to run toward stillness, instead of away from it?In June, I signed up to run a half-marathon the following November. I had no idea how to run a half-marathon. But there was my helpful Nike Run Club app, with a 14-week training course that included audio-guided runs from some of the world’s top runners. I’d expected the hard-charging, take-no-prisoners tone of other fitness apps I’d tried, but that’s not what I found. Instead, I virtually met coaches who preached patience.It also helped that the runs themselves were varied. There were days when my runs were 15 minutes. There were interval runs at different paces. There were bad runs and good runs and runs that I felt no particular way about at all and runs I quit halfway through. But I was running.I became a runner one afternoon in August, about two months into my program. I’d built up a tiny bit of confidence by then, managing to run once without stopping around Prospect Park, and I was at the point in my program where I was supposed to run three laps around in total. Advertisement     I was terrified, and expected to quit midway through. But something happened on the second lap. My brain quieted down and my body took over. The Nike coaches call this the moment when your training kicks in. I wasn’t thinking about running anymore.That’s when I realized that nobody runs a mile, or 10, or 26.2. They run a series of smaller races, one single step at a time. —Jamilah King
 


The Do!! You!!! Breakfast Show w/ Charlie Bones — $4/month at doyou.worldI always start my mornings off with music, but I can also be terribly indecisive when it comes to what I want to listen to. I explored various internet radio shows during the last year, and haven’t looked back after discovering Do!! You!!!.Every weekday morning, host Charlie Bones streams an eclectic mix of feel-good tunes from his London apartment, mixing in plenty of ’80s favorites like Sade and Prince alongside more modern underground fare. There are recurring listener-supported segments like “Jukebox,” where Bones cues up YouTube music links from the chatroom, and “Reader’s .wavs,” where he features unreleased music submitted by listeners.Since I live in Brooklyn, I’m asleep when the show airs at 9 a.m. GMT, but by 8 a.m. I get a ping that the new episode is available in the archive via the Mixcloud app, so it feels like I’m listening in real-time. If you’re still stuck cycling through the same old playlist every morning, you can’t go wrong handing over the aux to Charlie Bones. —Ben Kothe Advertisement     
 


The New York Times Crossword Mini via the designated NYT Crossword appThe Mini crossword is a tiny puzzle that can be done in just a few minutes (or a few seconds, if you’re having a “good Mini day”). It’s a fun, quick daily distraction, but the option to add others to a shared leaderboard is what brings me back every day. Facing off against a dozen or so friends for the fastest times has been a fun way to feel connected to people I don’t see often, and has led to plenty of heated group chat banter and bragging rights over the past year. —Ben KotheOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News

In a crucial ruling, a federal judge in Washington, DC, on Monday refused to dismiss conspiracy charges against Oath Keepers and associates of the group who stand accused of storming the Capitol on Jan. 6.Had Judge Amit Mehta granted the defendants’ motion, the largest and most serious of the cases against the alleged insurrectionists would likely have been gutted. Instead, Mehta, after more than six months of deliberation, issued a 49-page ruling that kept the charges intact, paving the way for the 17 defendants to face trial. Advertisement     As many as two dozen members and close affiliates of the armed extremist group Oath Keepers busted into the Capitol building in battle gear in a military-style “stack.”As Mehta noted, many of them had been summoned to Washington by a message the Oath Keepers’ leader, Stuart Rhodes, had posted on Jan. 4, urging them to “stand tall in support of President Trump’s fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are attempting a coup.” Some brought weapons, which they stashed in a hotel in Virginia, in case they were needed for a “quick reaction force.” And many joined an encrypted chat on the Signal messaging app to coordinate before and during the events of the insurrection.In the wake of the Capitol attack, prosecutors pointed to these and other actions as evidence of an organized conspiracy to disrupt an official proceeding, the certification of the Electoral College, which was among the most serious charges to come out of the sweeping Justice Department investigation.To date, at least three Oath Keepers who coordinated with the group have taken plea deals and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution. Another Oath Keeper who appeared to be in Washington on his own also pleaded guilty. Still, another 17 members or affiliates face decades in prison if convicted on a variety of charges. Advertisement     In mid-June, Thomas Caldwell, a retired Navy veteran who was not a dues-paying member of the Oath Keepers and did not enter the Capitol building but was in close contact with the group and stowed a .22 rifle at the Virginia hotel, filed the first motion to dismiss the charges.Other defendants filed similar motions and all 17 eventually joined the fight. Essentially, they claimed that the conspiracy charges should be dropped because they were vague, and because their actions on Jan. 6 amounted to First Amendment–protected free speech. They also questioned the idea that the certification of the Electoral College amounted to an “official proceeding” of Congress, and thus, any attempt to disrupt it wouldn’t count as a crime.In the 49-page ruling that included references to Supreme Court precedents and histories of legislation and Congressional intent, Mehta flatly disagreed.Noting that some of the defendants “entered with bear spray and assaulted police officers,” Mehta called their arguments “inaccurate,” adding that “their alleged conduct was no mere political protest or trespass.”After brushing aside numerous quibbles with the wording and intent of the language of the relevant criminal statutes, Mehta similarly cast aside the contention by the defendants that their activities on Jan. 6 were protected free speech. Donning paramilitary gear and supplies, barging their way past barricades and police to forcibly enter the Capitol building, and using encrypted messaging to keep their plans secret would not, he contends, be protected by the First Amendment.Because there are so many defendants in the case, and due to the huge volume of evidence presented by the government, Mehta has said he expects to try the case in two batches. The first is scheduled to begin April 19, with a second trial, if necessary, set for July 11. Advertisement

AirPods Max — $549 at AppleLook, Apple’s AirPods Max are some expensive headphones — like months'-worth-of-groceries expensive (Apple loaned BuzzFeed a pair to review.) And let’s be honest, your current earbuds probably sound pretty great and have more daily use cases. But if you feel you need over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max are a really good choice. They pump out clear, gloriously rich sound with solid separation. I am no audiophile, so I’ll not belabor this with “omg a unique magnesium cone!” minutiae. What I will say is that these headphones adeptly handled everything I threw at them, from the most annoyingly quiet Sufjan Stevens to colon-rupturing Swedish math metal. And they nailed the low note on Beastie Boys’ “Shake Your Rump,” which is the bass metric all headphones should be judged on. Beyond this, they’re thoughtfully designed, though their precious little charging purse is a bit much. So, yeah, if you’re intent on purchasing some high-end headphones, you’re not going to go wrong with these. But also: Groceries are a fun thing to have. —John Paczkowski
 


Casper Glow Light — $116 at CasperIt’s a very nice ambient light. You spin it to make it brighter or dimmer, which is both fun and handy. I use it as a bedside light and also as mood lighting in the living room when I watch TV at night. Then I can shut everything off and go to the bathroom or back to bed using just this light, which makes me feel like I’m in an old-timey movie using a candlestick. Convenient and pleasant! —Shannon Keating
 


Apple AirTags for my TV remote and rubber remote case — AirTags: $29 for one or $99 for four at Apple. Case: $7.99 at Amazon.The remote is by far the worst part of the older-model Apple TVs. It’s somehow super slippery in your hand and so light it feels hard to control. It’s super thin and small, the perfect size for losing between couch cushions. The newest 4K Apple TVs come with an improved remote, which is sold separately for $59, but that’s way more than I want to spend.So instead I put one of these rubber covers on my current remote. It makes it grippy and easy to hold, and the bright color is easy to find, which was great until my toddler decided it is her most coveted toy. Finding the remote very quickly became a daily, sometimes hourly issue. Either my daughter had run off with it, or an adult had hidden it from her to prevent that from happening. Advertisement  So I AirTagged the remote. The case has a special slot to accommodate Apple’s little item-tracking device. The “Precision Finding” feature in the iPhone’s Find My app makes it easy to find lost things like TV remotes with a visual tracking feature that approximates how far away an item is. And the extra weight the AirTag adds to the remote feels nice in the hand. If you’re only ever going to track a TV remote, you might consider Tile’s cheaper tracking device, but if you’re an iPhone person prone to misplacing more than one item (I wanted one for my keychain as well as my husband’s keys and one to stick in our car for the times I forgot where I parked), then the AirTag four-pack makes a lot of sense (Apple loaned me AirTags for review, but I liked them enough I bought my own.) —Katie Notopoulos
 


Janome 2212 sewing machine — $199 at AmazonAt some point last winter, I developed an itch for making things with my hands. I dreamed of becoming a DIY person, and that dream wore out my credit card. I bought paint, canvases, 10 balls of yarn, knitting needles, embroidery hoops, a hot glue gun that’s still sitting in my drawer, unopened. And in my frenzy, I also got a sewing machine, a Janome 2212 that Google led me to believe was “an easy sewing machine for beginners.” Advertisement  To my great surprise, it was not easy. Sewing machines have too many knobs and too many labels, too many sections to thread your string through and around, and yet are so finicky that you have to wonder why we’ve gone to the moon but can’t make a simpler, more efficient machine for sewing. It’s a messy and frustrating hobby, and it will fill up your room with scrap fabric and half-finished projects. I’ve lost entire days using this thing. I’ve made dresses, I’ve altered sweaters, and I’ve watched hours of YouTube tutorials explaining what the hell a French seam is and how to sew a zipper on. You have to follow instructions and be patient, two qualities I don’t care for. None of the clothes I’ve made have ever come out well; there’s always a loose thread somewhere and wonky stitching. But it’s also, somehow, meditative, and when you’re out in a dress you made and someone asks where it’s from, you get to say, “Thanks, I made it. Just don’t look too closely.” —Clarissa-Jan Lim
 


RadRover 6 Plus electric bike — $1,999 at Rad Power BikesI can’t afford the RadRover 6 Plus electric bike, but I was lucky enough to try it (Rad Power Bikes loaned BuzzFeed a bike to review) and, yes, I liked it. Loved it, actually. And I say that as someone who has never quite understood the electric bike phenomenon. But after this bike took me to a favorite fishing hole at 22 mph and then off-roaded me up a poorly maintained trail right to the water without requiring really anything of me or my rickety knee, I get it. I am not a bike expert. My last bike was stolen, and the one before that was a trashed Huffy Thunder Road. But I found the RadRover to be pretty amazing, though it is quite heavy and built like a small motorcycle. Great ride, good battery life, and very easy to use — even for e-bike Luddites like me. —John Paczkowski Advertisement  
 


Plasma Coil guitar pedal — $350 from Third ManThough you undoubtedly know Jack White best for his guitar work in bands like the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, he's doing some equally amazing things with Third Man Records, an independent label and, most importantly for the purposes of this review, a purveyor of a guitar pedal called the Plasma Coil. This is an apt name for a pedal that distorts the notes you play on a guitar by expressing them as a electrical discharges *you can see* courtesy a xenon gas–filled tube. Designed by Gamechanger Audio, the Plasma Coil literally amplifies audio signals to 3,500 volts. It sounds as badass as it looks — like a 50-pound wasp nest. It’s pretty much lightning in a box and an absolute blast to play. And if you dig the Plasma Coil, it’s worth noting that a few of Third Man’s other pedals are equally impressive, including the Bumble Buzz, (a sick fuzz box) and the Triplegraph (a digital octave pedal with individual octave-up and octave-down channels that make your guitar sound like a noise in a science fiction movie). —John Paczkowski
 


The Fantasy Trip: Legacy Edition role-playing game — $119 at AmazonSince I was (a) locked down at home and (b) no longer commuting, I had extra hours and nostalgia for the role-playing game of my adolescence — a criminally simple and fun one called the Fantasy Trip. Popular for its single-player adventures back in the 1970s and perfect for the pandemic era, the game was revived two years ago by its original designer in a legacy edition. A throwback to the mayhem-flavored era of pen-and-paper games, the easy but elegant rules allow for intriguing match-ups against monsters represented by cardboard square game pieces that evoke the era when light beer was new. Anyone who’s bored stiff at the thought of learning the latest gaudy Dungeons & Dragons rules but wants to bump off a band of bugbears, or who’s middle-aged enough to try to entice (force) your kids to do so with easy-to-learn rules, might give it a shot. I managed after a few tries to get my band of paper bravoes through a death test dungeon after a few weekends of on-and-off playing, and it has been a solace on rainy weekends ever since. In a nice mixture of old and new, I now play it over Roll20.net with an old high school buddy now living in Germany. —Dan Vergano
 


Lamicall metal phone stand — $9.99 at AmazonIn 2021, this became an essential part of my workstation. It allows my phone to act as a second screen (technically a third screen, since I already use a laptop plus a monitor). I previously had a flat wood stand that held the phone in a way that completely covered its speakers and microphone, making it impossible for video calling. This metal style also allows you to charge while on the stand. —Katie Notopoulos Advertisement  
 


Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K projector — $699 at AmazonWho needs a TV when any flat surface in your home is a screen? Anker’s Cosmos projector is remarkably good at playing movies on bare white walls with a clarity of picture and sound that will satisfy most everyone but AV aficionados. With Dolby Digital Plus 360° theatrical audio and a sharp 1080p resolution, a 900 ANSI Lumen autofocus display that can be recalibrated almost instantly and sharpened with the press of a button, the Cosmos solidly and accurately plays everything from home movies on a bedroom wall to Aliens on a bedsheet in your backyard. It runs Google’s Android TV, so it supports Netflix, YouTube, and a host of other apps right out of the box (Anker loaned BuzzFeed a projector to review.)—John Paczkowski
 


LectroFan white noise machine — $45 at AmazonFour mammals live in my home, and we all need our beauty rest. The busy New York City block we live on poses challenges: barflies late at night, trash trucks first thing in the morning, and every other imaginable city noise in the hours between. That’s why we swear by white noise machines. My wife and I share one. My 18-month-old falls asleep to one. Even my dog, my sweet, neurotic Chihuahua-dachshund, has a white noise machine on top of his crate. He gets scared, OK? —Joe Bernstein
 


Facebook Portal Go — $199 at PortalYes, there’s an irony that despite everything that BuzzFeed News has reported about Facebook over the past few years, I am recommending a Facebook product. If you want to feel truly pure about not supporting Meta, Facebook’s new parent company, well, go ahead and delete your Instagram account. It probably makes more money off showing you ads than the company would off a hardware purchase. I’ll wait.The truth is, the Portal is a great video chatting device. The smart camera follows you around the room and can accommodate more than one face at a time. It’s great for connecting distant grandparents and small kids, particularly the rechargeable Portal Go, which can be carried from room to room. My kid loves taking Grandma out into the yard to show off his toys and adventures. Advertisement  When I first tested the Go (Facebook loaned BuzzFeed a Portal to review), my one big complaint was that there was no way to fully disable the “Watch Together” function during a call, which can be an issue if you want to control the videos your kids watch. Meta’s head of VR and Portal promised to fix this. So starting in December, you can block Watch Together completely during calls. —Katie Notopoulos
 


Vilo mesh Wi-Fi routers — $70 for three at AmazonYou may have heard of this “mesh Wi-Fi” thing from your friends who have bigger houses and more tech smarts than you. The Vilo is the mesh router for everyone else. The idea is that instead of one crappy router you stash under your bed, you evenly space three futuristic white bricks throughout your house. As you walk from room to room, you’ll always have a clear, strong Wi-Fi connection. Why would someone who lives in a small Brooklyn apartment need three Wi-Fi routers? The obvious answer is: Why the hell not? Vilos are about $70 for three and surprisingly attractive for a router. By comparison, a fancy mesh system from Google is $349. Wirecutter’s “budget pick” is still $130. I loathe spending money, but these guys just make sense. —Scott PhamOpening illustration by Raymond Biesinger for BuzzFeed News
