1898,"Amidst all the fist-pumping and Bono-goofing yesterday, one piece of information was conspicuously absent: The Apple Watch's battery life. What's the point of strapping a tiny computer to your body if it needs constant charging? According to Re/code, even Apple hasn't quite figured out the battery dilemma yet.

After Tim Cook mentioned charging Apple Watch ""every night"" on stage, John Paczkowski confirms today that a source within Apple pins the charge-by date at nightly—which would imply that the Apple Watch has a battery life of less than a day. Apparently, Apple is still working to improve that number before release. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging,"" an Apple spokesperson told Paczkowski, seemingly confirming the source.

This isn't just Apple's problem. As a paradigm, smartwatches still have quite a few kinks that need working out before they'll seem truly functional—and battery life is one of the biggest. On Monday, Gizmodo's Brent Rose reported that the Moto 360's battery life, while not as bad as expected, was only about 24 hours.

That's not terrible, but it does present some problems from a user experience perspective. The main selling point of many smartwatches is that they will constantly track your activity, from sleeping to working out. If your device needs to be charged for even a few hours every day, that's lost data, as information designer Nicholas Felton pointed out yesterday on Twitter:

Also sad that the watch charging solution means unbroken health stats are impossible. Not necessary for everyone, but important for many.

— Nicholas Felton (@feltron) September 9, 2014

Sure, not everyone cares about tracking things like REM cycles. Not everyone will mind taking off their watch for a few hours every day. But the ideal use case for Apple Watch, just like a regular watch, is effortless omnipresence. It should just work—and for periods of time longer than 12 hours. [Re/code]"
1899,"An Israeli-Canadian woman who traveled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurds there earlier this month has been abducted by Islamic State fighters, Hebrew media reported Sunday, citing Syrian jihadist-linked media.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, was captured by jihadists near the flashpoint city of Kobani in the past few days, reports said. The former IDF soldier and Canada native was taken after the jihadists launched three suicide bombings in the area, and her condition is unknown.


The reports were not initially confirmed by the Islamic State group. In Israel, the Foreign Ministry said it was looking into the reports while stressing that the websites that carried the information were “of dubious credibility.”

Two Kurdish fighters quoted by Israel Radio cast doubt on the reports. One, an American fighter, said Rosenberg was never in Kobani. Another soldier on the ground said that he had heard nothing of her alleged abduction.

In her last Facebook post to date, Rosenberg wrote on November 20 that someone would be managing her profile for two weeks, and asked that people not message her “as this is not me.”

IS launched an attack Saturday on the Syrian border town of Kobani from Turkey, a Kurdish official and activists said, although Turkey denied that the fighters had used its territory for the raid.

The assault began when a suicide bomber driving an armored vehicle detonated an explosive device on the border crossing between Kobani and Turkey, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria’s powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party.

The Islamic State group “used to attack the town from three sides,” Khalil said. “Today, they are attacking from four sides.”

The Islamic State group claimed three suicide attacks in Kobani’s border crossing point, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. The group, quoting Twitter accounts linked to the militants, said the suicide attacks were carried out by a Saudi and a Turkmen, adding that one of them was driving a Humvee.

The first foreign woman to join the Kurdish forces, Rosenberg set out from her home in Tel Aviv on November 2, stopping in Amman before flying to Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

Rosenberg told Israel Radio that she wanted to do her part for the Kurdish national struggle, and that she was hopeful her experience in the Israel Defense Forces would be useful to the Kurds.

According to Rosenberg’s Facebook page, she served in the IDF’s Home Front Command.

Rosenberg has posted pictures of herself in mountains of Iraq and Syrian Kurdistan.

“In the IDF, we say Aharai – After Me. Let’s show ISIS what that means,” she wrote, using an alternate acronym for Islamic State.

In 2009, Rosenberg was arrested in a joint Israeli police and FBI operation on suspicion that she had been part of a ring that cheated elderly American citizens out of their money by posing as lottery officials and convincing the unsuspecting seniors to pay for fictive services, according to the Walla news site. The members of the ring, which included 11 other Israeli citizens aside from Rosenberg, were said to have stolen up to $25 million.

Rosenberg was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to four years in a US prison, though her term was eventually shortened and she was deported to Israel instead, Channel 10 reported.

The Islamic State group began its Kobani offensive in mid-September, capturing parts of the town as well as dozens of nearby villages. The town later became the focus of airstrikes by the US-led coalition against the militants.

Kurdish fighters slowly have been advancing in Kobani since late October, when dozens of well-armed Iraqi peshmerga fighters joined fellow Syrian Kurds in the battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of fighters on both sides over the past two months.

If confirmed, Rosenberg would be the second Israeli captive held by the jihadist group. Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by the Islamic State group in early September. Sotloff went missing in Syria in August 2013, and the jihadists were reportedly unaware of his Jewish heritage and Israeli citizenship until after his death.

1900,"He’s being called a hero for shooting a rampaging gunman dead on Parliament Hill — and it may mark the first time Sergeant-At-Arms Kevin Vickers has ever fired a gun in the line of duty.

“This the first time in his career that he’s shot anyone,” said Erin, Vickers’ niece.

A retired RCMP officer who once served in Calgary, 58-year-old Vickers is known to most Canadians as the symbol of order at the House of Commons: a grey-haired man in a black hat and robes, often carrying the ceremonial sceptre of Canada over his shoulder.

On Tuesday, Vickers reportedly showed just how serious his role really is, the head of security for Canada’s government killing a gunman who charged into the Centre Block on Parliament Hill.

“To all in Ottawa, stay safe & strong. Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our Cdn security forces. True heroes…” Tweeted Minister Peter MacKay.

Julian Fantino, Canada’s Minister of Veterans Affairs, added his own Tweet of gratitude.

“I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”

After the shooting, Vickers immediately contacted his family in New Brunswick to tell them he is safe — “I’m doing okay,” he said — but that hasn’t stopped them worrying about the emotional trauma that will follow, having being forced to pull the trigger for the first time.

“We’re always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him — he had to make a very serious decision today,” said Mary, Vicker’s older sister.

“He’s always a natural leader — he would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can’t stress that enough — but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.”

Raw footage of the Centre Block attack show officers and guards moving cautiously down the hall, before gunfire suddenly erupts, with dozens of shots echoing in the distance.

Various witnesses have credited Vickers with leading the security response and killing the infiltrator, a man who may have been the same cold-blooded murderer who gunned down an unarmed solider outside the national cenotaph moments before.

Anyone who thought Canada’s Sergeant-At-Arms role was an archaic novelty now understands the man holding the sceptre has a deadly serious job.

“It’s not ceremonial at all, and he has tremendous responsibility — and he wears it well,” said Mary.

In an RCMP career spanning 29 years, Vickers rose up the ranks from a constable in the Northwest Territories to serving ten years in Alberta, and then to chief superintendent in Ottawa.

After retiring from the force, he took the Sergeant-At-Arms job on Parliament Hill, and was once famously photographed escorting a protestor masquerading as a page from the House of Commons.

His niece Erin says her uncle is a calm, gentle man — but someone who handles pressure with utmost calm.

“He’s a thoughtful and considerate person — he’s halfway to a saint in my opinion,” she said.

“He’s a very capable human being.”

1901,"Ryan Roche, 32, of Levi, was coaxed into participating in the competition at his office's holiday party. Though he shattered the contest record, an infection started in his lungs and he spent three days in the hospital.

His competitive Christmas spirit nearly killed him.

After being pressured into an eggnog-chugging contest at an office party, a Utah man nearly died from an infection that started in his lungs.

A YouTube video shows triumphant Ryan Roche down a carton of eggnog in a record 12 seconds, shattering the previous record of 22 seconds. For his victory, he received a gift card to a local steak house - and a trip to the hospital.

Roche told the Daily News he was actually about to leave the Dec. 10 holiday soiree with his family when the organizers broke out the eggnog.

A colleague called him out, and the competitive Roche refused to walk away.

Without even sparing time to taste it, the sales manager finished the quart of eggnog in record time -- but Roche said he immediately knew there was a problem.

The Lehi resident had done other chugging competitions in the past without incident, but as soon as this one ended, he couldn't breathe. In the video, he's seen bending over after finishing the drink.

Afterward, he coughed a lot and had trouble breathing as the thick holiday drink blocked his airways.

A few hours later he decided to go to the hospital.

""Initially I felt very nauseous and pretty sick,"" he said. ""After I was put on antibiotics and an IV I was no longer nauseous.""

But Roche spent three full days in the hospital. Because he'd breathed in the eggnog, the liquid caused an infection in his lungs.

""The next few days my body would change from having a fever to shivering nonstop,"" he said. ""It was like every hour on the hour it would change.""

About a week after being discharged from the hospital, Roche said he was back to full strength and feeling good.

His unusual illness also made him a celebrity inside the hospital.

""I can't tell you how many doctors or nurses would walk into my room and say, 'Eggnog, huh?' Then they'd say, 'Well, at least you won,'"" he said.

And the experience has not completely soured him on eggnog.

""I was never a big fan of it to begin with,"" he said. ""I could drink it again, but it's not my drink of choice.""

And though he is proud of his record, Roche said he will not be defending his title at future parties.

""No chance,"" he said. ""Even if someone challenged me to do it, my wife wouldn't allow it.""

1905,"NEW YORK — Pope Francis has given hope to gays, unmarried couples and advocates of the Big Bang theory. Now, he has endeared himself to dog lovers, animal-rights activists and vegans.

Trying to console a little boy whose dog had died, Pope Francis told him in a recent public appearance on St Peter’s Square that “paradise is open to all of God’s creatures”. While it is unclear whether the Pope’s remarks helped soothe the child, they were welcomed by groups such as the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

In his relatively short tenure as leader of the world’s one billion Roman Catholics since taking over from Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, 77, has repeatedly caused a stir among conservatives in the church.

He has suggested more lenient positions than his predecessor on issues such as homosexuality, single motherhood and unwed couples.

Theologians cautioned that Pope Francis had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.

Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America, a Catholic magazine, said he believed that Pope Francis was at least asserting that “God loves and Christ redeems all of creation”, even though conservative theologians have said paradise is not for animals. “He said paradise is open to all creatures,” Rev Martin said.

The question of whether animals go to heaven has been debated for much of the church’s history. Pope Benedict said during a 2008 sermon that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on earth”.

Ms Christine Gutleben, senior director of the Humane Society, said Pope Francis’ apparent reversal of his predecessor’s view could be enormous. “If the Pope did mean that all animals go to heaven, then the implication is that animals have a soul. And if that is true, then we ought to seriously consider how we treat them because they mean something to God,” she said.

Ms Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA, one of the most activist anti-slaughterhouse groups, said the Pope’s remarks could move Catholics away from consuming meat. But there are differing views.

Mr Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said in an email that it “certainly does not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin”. THE NEW YORK TIMES"
1906,"LONDON -- A pickup truck once owned by a plumbing company in Texas has somehow found its way to the front lines of Syria's civil war and been converted into an anti-aircraft weapon for Islamic militants.

A photo posted to Twitter on Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, an Islamic extremist brigade seemingly comprised largely of Chechen fighters, shows the Ford F-250 with a militant standing in the bed firing the anti-aircraft gun.

Speaking to CBS News Tuesday morning, a representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said the vehicle was sold to the AutoNation dealership in Houston in Oct. 2013, and that's the last they knew of it.

The company has been besieged by phone calls -- including threats -- since the photo appeared online, clearly showing the company's name and phone number. CBS News is not identifying the company due to the nature of some of the attention it has received.

They have employed an attorney and intend to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo from the Internet.

Reached by CBS News Tuesday morning, a person identifying himself as a manager at AutoNation would not comment on the sale history of the vehicle in question, saying ""we can't give information like that over the phone,"" before hanging up the phone.

The representative of the plumbing company in Texas City said they would ""most definitely"" be removing their logo from all vehicles sold in the future.

Ansar al-Deen Front has been fighting in the complicated Syrian war primarily around Aleppo, Syria's largest city and formerly the economic powerhouse of the nation.

It has been the scene of some of the most vicious fighting between Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and the myriad rebel groups trying to topple him, but is largely controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

Singh was charged with conspiracy involving the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and several female followers claim he sexually assaulted them but he has never been convicted.

The current case was brought by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, who accuse Singh of grievous bodily harm.

1911,"In the days leading up to Apple's big event next week, which is rumored to be focused on the Apple Watch, a new detail about the company's first wearable has been leaked.  Along with all other features mentioned during Tim Cook's unveiling of the smartwatch in September, the device will also come with a feature called Power Reserve, according to The New York Times.

The report, which cites an anonymous Apple employee, claims that the unannounced feature will allow the watch operate in a mode that only shows the current time on its display, presumably to preserve battery power for other functions.

A standby mode for a wearable isn't particularly innovative, but given the questions surrounding the battery life of the Apple Watch (about a day, according to Apple), a Power Reserve feature dedicated to preserving battery life could be the device's saving grace. (Particularly when figures like $5,000 are being tossed around the rumor mill as the price for the top tier model.)

Another surprising detail revealed in the report is that during field testing of the Apple Watch, engineers disguised the device with a fake casing to make it look like a Samsung smartwatch. So if you've seen Apple employees walking around with what looks like a Samsung Gear and wondered why, you now have an answer to the mystery.

That last detail will probably come as a surprise to Samsung, a company often accused of following Apple's lead when it comes to mobile devices. But it also highlights the fact that Apple is entering a space already packed with smartwatches, so the success of the Apple Watch isn't a foregone conclusion, solid battery life or not.

1912,"Security forces investigating the role of municipal police in clashes in this southern city a week ago found a mass grave on the edge of town, raising fears the pits might hold 43 students missing since the violence that also resulted in six shooting deaths.

Guerrero Gov. Angel Aguirre said the victims had been “savagely slaughtered.”

Jesus Lopez, the father of one of the missing students, told The Associated Press that a delegation of family and school representatives would come to Iguala on Sunday to get information about developments in the case from authorities.

“We cannot say anything. We are very nervous, but until they inform us, there is nothing,” said Lopez, whose 19-year-old son, Giovani, hasn’t been seen since the violence last weekend.

Separately, a group of students and relatives of the missing young people said they planned to march Sunday from Aytozinapa Normal school to the state capital of Chilpancingo to demand information in the case.

Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the school protested outside the governor’s Chilpancingo residence. They threw Molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state authorities told them they would not allow them to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates.

Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco did not say Saturday night how many bodies were in the burial pits uncovered on a hillside on Iguala’s outskirts, and he declined to speculate about whether the dead were the missing students.

“It would be irresponsible” to jump to conclusions before tests to identify the bodies, Blanco said. Officials said the federal Attorney General’s Office and the National Human Rights Commission had sent teams of experts to aid state authorities in identifying the remains.

About 100 soldiers, marines and federal and state police on Saturday cordoned off the area where the grave site was found in the poor Pueblo Viejo district of Iguala, which is about 120 miles (200 kilometres) south of Mexico City.

Blanco said eight more people had been arrested in the case, adding to the 22 Iguala city police officers detained after a police confrontation with student protesters last weekend set off a series of violent incidents in the city.

The prosecutor has said state investigators had obtained videos showing that local police arrested an undetermined number of students after the initial clash and took them away.

He said some of the eight newly arrested people were members of an organized crime gang, adding that some of them had given key clues leading to the discovery of the mass grave.

Blanco said his investigators had found that “elements of the municipal police are part of organized crime.” He also said his office was searching for Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and had alerted officials across Mexico to be on the lookout for him.

The governor had charged earlier in the week that organized crime had infiltrated the city government.

State prosecutors have said the first bloodshed occurred when city police shot at buses that had been hijacked by protesting students from a teachers college, killing three youths and wounding 25. A few hours later, unidentified masked gunmen shot at two taxis and a bus carrying a soccer team on the main highway, killing two people on the bus and one in a taxi.

Violence is frequent in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory.

The Aytozinapa Normal school attended by the missing students, like many other schools in Mexico’s “rural teachers college” system, is known for militant and radical protests that often involve hijacking buses and delivery trucks.

In December 2011, two students from Aytozinapa died in a clash with police on the highway that leads to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. Students had allegedly hijacked buses and blocked the road to press demands for more funding and assured jobs after graduation. Two state police officers were charged in the shootings.

During that confrontation, students apparently set fire to pumps at a gas station on the highway when federal and state police moved in to quell the protest, and a gas station employee later died of burns suffered in the attack."
1913,"A blast near the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua on Saturday night was most likely caused by a meteorite plummeting to Earth, creating a 40-foot-wide crater.

A piece of the 2014 RC asteroid that passed close to Earth on Sunday, the meteorite dug a 16-foot-deep hole, Nicaraguan government scientists said. Miraculously, no one was hurt.

The 60-foot-wide asteroid was passing 25,000 miles from Earth on Sunday but posed no danger to the planet, NASA said.

Authorities have yet to determine whether the meteorite is buried or whether it disintegrated when it hit the ground. At first, locals believed the blast was caused by an earthquake, a regular occurrence in the country, Reuters said.

“All the evidence that we’ve confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,” said Jose Millan of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies.

The explosion on the outskirts of Managua, near the city’s airport, took place at around 11 p.m. and left a crater the size of a house.

“It could have come off that asteroid because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” said Humberto Garcia, a Nicaraguan volcanologist.

Calling it a “fascinating event,” Nicaragua’s first lady, Rosario Murillo, said the country would work with the U.S. Geological Service to find out more about what happened, The Daily Telegraph said."

The recording was taken by an unidentified local who was engaged in, and recording, another discussion at the time of the shooting, the man’s attorney Lopa Blumenthal told CNN.

The outlet’s Don Lemon said that “CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape,” noting that they “reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording.”

PHOTOS: Most Shocking ‘Not Guilty’ Verdicts

Paul Ginsberg, an expert on audio forensics, said he heard 10 shots on the recording, first a series of six, then four more.

Blumenthal said the pause between the sixth and seventh shots fired could figure as key evidence into the ongoing investigation of the incident.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” Blumenthal, said the FBI has perused the recordings, told CNN. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson, triggering more than a week of rioting in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, and bringing race relations to the forefront of the country’s consciousness. Wilson’s actions in the deadly incident remain under scrutiny from both a grand jury and federal investigators.

“We’re not anti-police — we respect police,” Sharpton said at the proceedings. “But those police that are wrong need to be dealt with just like those in our community that are wrong need to be dealt with.”

1917,"Apple originally planned for the Apple Watch to have a whole range of exciting health-tracking features, but the company had to cut many of them before its anticipated release this April, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Apple Watch was meant to feature a system to track how stressed you are by measuring the conductivity of skin. You sweat more if you're nervous, and that makes your skin more conductive.

The Watch also included an electrocardiogram feature that measures a user's heart rate (that's more in-depth than simply measuring a pulse). But Apple couldn't get the health-tracking features to work in the way it wanted. It found that people with hairy arms or dry skin had trouble using the health monitors. And the watch didn't work properly on people who wore it too loosely around their wrist.

Other features that didn't make it into the final Apple Watch were blood-pressure and blood-oxygen-level tracking, according to The Journal. Those would have been tricky for Apple to include because providing medical advice or guidance from that data comes under the regulation of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the US. We do know, however, that Apple secretly met with the FDA in 2013 to find out which features would come under the agency's regulation.

Apple was forced to cut the advanced health-tracking features from the Apple Watch because it simply couldn't get them to work. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to add them back in future versions of the device, though.

Elsewhere in its article, The Journal says the Apple Watch was known at Apple by the name ""black hole"" because it kept drawing in more and more resources. Development of the device reportedly took over four years."
1918,"MEXICO CITY — Rumors about the death of Fidel Castro — an age-old ritual for Cuba-watchers — once again began circulating on and off the island this week.

It’s true that Castro hasn't been seen in public in about a year, and it’s been a few months since one of his last columns were published. Castro, 88, has not said one public word about the historic announcement by President Obama last month about his goal of moving toward normal relations with Cuba after a half-century Cold War stand-off.

Twitter went wild Thursday night with speculation about his demise. Why? There are rumors about that, too. One of them is that another Fidel Castro, this one the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died a few days ago (Fidel Castro Odinga of Nairobi), and maybe this was all a social media mash-up of mistaken identity.

Also, an Argentine Web site reported that foreign press in Havana had been summoned to a news conference — presumably to announce the huge news — but this turned out to be false. On the island, there was more talk this morning that Fidel’s brother, current President Raul Castro, would be speaking today at noon, but that came and went in silence.

Instead, Cuban state media has been promoting a round-table interview with the three members of the “Cuban 5” who were released from U.S. custody as part of the prisoner swap.

The Cuban government hasn’t spoken one way or the other about Fidel Castro’s health in recent days."

New York City officials are considering issuing tickets for possession of small amounts of marijuana instead of arresting people, officials said.

The new guidelines would allow people with low-level marijuana possession to be issued a court summons rather than requiring them to get handcuffed, arrested, and brought into the precinct for finger-printing, the New York Times reports.

1921,"The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.

Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.

The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.

The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.

“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.

He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.

In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.

The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.

Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.

1922,"Updated Dec. 31, 2014 11:30 a.m. EST.

This video proves that a person's integrity goes far beyond what meets the eye.

In a video uploaded to YouTube, prankster Josh Paler Lin gives $100 to a homeless man and secretly follows the him to find out how it's spent.

The homeless man is seen on camera buying food and giving it to strangers in the park. The sight turns Lin's perception of homelessness on its head.

Lin says he is ""stunned"" and admits he thought the man might buy alcohol.

""You just touched my heart,"" Lin told him.

While the gesture left the prankster so emotional that he decided to donate another $100, he also had something to offer Lin:

""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance,"" the homeless man told him. ""And they didn't go homeless because they're lazy ...It could be a divorce, and one thing leads to another. A man sells his boat, his home, and all of a sudden he finds out he has no money. There's a lot of good people that are homeless.""

Update: Taugan Tan Kadalim, a passerby to the scene, told Vocativ that he witnessed some of the filming of the video and that the incident appeared to be staged. Kadalim told the site that Lin and the homeless man arrived at the liquor store in the same car. In response, Lin told HuffPost that Vocativ's allegation is ""false.""

1923,"Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's ""spiderman"" might not be all it seemed.

Perth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.

Earlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing ""a really burning sensation like a searing feeling"" in his abdomen.

Dylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.

Thomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a ""tropical spider"".

But it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was ""almost impossible"" for the culprit to have been a spider.

""If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,"" he said.

""We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.""

Dr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case ""bizarre"".

""I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,"" he said.

""Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.

""Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.""

Dr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.
""We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,"" he said.

""None of those are true, they're just made up stories.

""They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.""

Something which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do ""live on humans"".

""We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,"" he said.

""They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.""

Dr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.

""It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,"" he said.

""If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.""

Dylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.

1925,"YouTuber Josh Paler Lin – better-known for his hilarious pranks – was feeling the holiday spirit and decided to give a homeless man in California $100 to see what he would do with it. 

He followed the man, Thomas, with a camera to see how he spent the money. His first stop was a liquor store, but not for the reasons some might think: He bought bread and then headed over to a park, where Lin filmed him distributing the food to other homeless people. 

When Lin approached him at the park, Thomas explained his story. He quit his job to take care of his sick parents, only to lose his home after his parents died within two weeks of each other. He's been on the streets for four months. 

""I feel I owe you an apology,"" Lin told Thomas after hearing his story. 




Thomas explained that he simply wanted to use the money to help others in his situation. Lin gave him another $100 and has even started a crowdfunding campaign to help buy Thomas clothes, food and get him on the road to a job. He's already surpassed his $10,00 goal and raised over $60,000. 

""There are things money can't buy and I get happiness out of what I'm doing,"" Thomas told Lin. 

""And I honestly truly understand what he meant right after because as I've helped him I feel so happy,"" Lin told TODAY."
1926,"NBC's lead anchor defended the meteorologist and explained that he had lost contact with the control room and was trying to call them with his cellphone. Seidel was unknowingly placed on live television Saturday night while his back was turned to the camera, fueling the incorrect rumors.

After hundreds of mentions on social media the past two days, NBC News anchor Brian Williams slammed those who speculated they caught meteorologist Mike Seidel relieving himself live on air and said they owe him an apology.

The anchor for the network's “Nightly News” program chose to squash the Internet rumors on Monday's broadcast that Seidel was caught ""writing his name on the snow"" when reporting from a major snowstorm in North Carolina Saturday.

""Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology,” Williams declared.

On Saturday’s broadcast, anchor Lester Holt said they were going to the station's No. 1 meteorologist for a report.

Seidel appeared to be, well, a wee bit busy, as his back was turned to the camera and he was slightly hunched forward. A few seconds after he was introduced he could be heard asking ""Why?"" and then turned around and put on his gloves.

The strange television blooper from Sugar Mountain, N.C., fueled speculation that he was relieving himself behind some trees.

The segment also led to some teasing for the weather professional.

I think mike seidel was writing lester holt in the snow... how embarrassing got to love east coast live tv pic.twitter.com/KmKn27Fgc2

""Oh, to pee on Sugar Mountain With the barometers and the weather balloons @MikeSeidel peed on Sugar Mountain But @NBCNews cut away too soon,"" tweeted the fake Brian Williams account.

The social media analytics site Topsy reports Seidel had more than 250 mentions since Saturday's broadcast.

But the speculation was incorrect and Williams wanted to make sure his audience of about 8 million nightly viewers knew the real story.

""The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation,"" he said on the telecast.

He then explained Seidel had lost cellphone contact with the control room and couldn't hear through his attached earpiece, he didn't know he was on the air and took off his gloves so he could call them with his phone that was tethered to his ear. His phone had lost its signal, a network spokesman told the Daily News.

""That's when the rumors hit the Web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,"" Williams said. ""It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.""

A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing http://t.co/MoogDLa3z1""

Seidel tweeted the video of Williams' statement Monday night with a thank you to his anchor.

""A BIG thanks to Brian Williams for having my back! M/T ""He cleared up internet rumor about what I was REALLY doing,"" he tweeted.

Of course, it was seeing Seidel’s back that started this whole thing.

1931,"There are conflicting claims about ISIS being at the border, but there are reasons not to trust reporting that the claim is false."
1933,"At least not anytime soon

The internet has been salivating at the prospect of getting stoned and eating fried chicken this week, after reports circulated that KFC is to become a marijuana dispensary as well as a restaurant.

A story on Racket Report claimed that with tax revenue from sales of the drug being so high in Colorado, KFC wanted a piece of the action, with the added benefit that its chicken would see a boost in sales thanks to the munchies.

It looks to be false for several reasons however:

- Racket Report has carried a lot of hoax stories in the past

- KFC hasn't mentioned marijuana on its official news page

- Marijuana sales are currently cash only which would make things tricky for the chain

- Marijuana is still in somewhat of a legal grey area and probably not crystal clear enough for a giant brand to start slinging it

- KFC doesn't even sell alcohol, so they'd really be jumping in at the deep end

While weed might not be hitting KFC any time soon, with sweeping legalisation in the US this sort of thing is inevitable.

Only yesterday, Ben & Jerry's said they'd be up for creating cannabis-infused ice-cream once it's completely legal.

Update: KFC confirmed it. Not happening."
1934,"New audio has surfaced that allegedly captures the moment when Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on Aug. 9.

CNN aired the unverified recording on Monday night. Six shots can be heard, followed by a pause, then several more. A private autopsy performed on Aug. 17 at the request of Brown's family found that the 18-year-old was shot 6 times, including twice in the head.

A man who lives near the scene of the shooting says he inadvertently recorded the shots that killed Brown, his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN. The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.

Brown was shot on Aug. 9 after he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking in the street and were stopped by Wilson. Johnson, said that Wilson attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked Wilson, and said that Wilson was injured after the altercation. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.

Police released footage on Aug. 15 that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Wilson was not aware that Brown was a suspect in a robbery when he stopped the teen, though Jackson later said that Wilson ""made the connection"" during the course of the stop. The family's attorney accused police of trying to ""assassinate the character of Michael Brown"" to divert attention from his death."
1936,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was attacked in prison and left blinded and paralyzed, a satirical website claimed in a story that quickly went viral this weekend.

On Saturday, the site Empire News posted a story claiming that the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was found lying in a pool of blood in his cell in Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts. The story made the rounds on the internet, with thousands of shares on Facebook and other social media and many welcoming the news.

But there is one problem — the incident never happened, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is still safe in his cell awaiting trial. Though the story fooled many, others noted that Empire News is a site dedicated entirely to satire, like a lesser known version of The Onion.

Those who browsed the site a bit found that out. Empire News has posted other stories including “Former Vice President Al Gore Arrested For Indecent Exposure,” and “It’s Official: New York Jets Moving To Los Angeles, Construction Of Los Angeles Stadium Begins.”

The details of the story itself gave readers reason for doubt.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

The story went on to say that Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was actually attacked in prison by members of the Aryan Nation prison gang.

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

While Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was not attacked in prison, the Boston Marathon bombing suspect could still be killed for his crimes. He may face the death penalty if convicted."
1938,"An 85-year-old woman in Waco, Texas has been been arrested for allegedly kidnapping neighbor’s cats and making them into fur coats.

Local residents couldn’t figure out where their cats were disappearing, so one or more residents decided to hire a private investigator. Some even thought they saw their own cats as a part of her fur coats. Eventually, the investigator successfully videotaped the woman stealing a neighbor’s cat.

According to World News Daily Report, the woman admitted in court that she tried to raise her own cats, but became too attached to them.

Prior to being caught on tape, the woman denied all allegations.

Prosecutors allege that the retired fashion designer skinned the cats in her basement. The following is a photo of the woman wearing one of her fur coats:

Investigators estimate that a total of 30 coats were required to make a single jacket. Additionally, they report that 20 skinned cats were found at the crime scene.

If found guilty, the unnamed woman could spend up to 18 months in prison."
1939,"British man suspected of appearing in videos of hostages being beheaded

The British Isis militant suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages has been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi from London.

The Washington Post published a lengthy article naming the masked man known as Jihadi John, who spoke in the videos with a British accent.

Emwazi, believed to be aged 27, was known to MI5 as a ""person of interest"" in 2011, according to the BBC. It reports that his name was not revealed at an earlier stage for ""operational reasons"".

One of Emwazi's friends was quoted by The Post as saying: “I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John.""

The Post claims that Emwazi is from an affluent family in west London and graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in computer programming. It says he is believed to have travelled to Syria in 2012 and later joined Isis.

An international manhunt led by the FBI was launched in August 2014 when he was thought to have appeared in video footage showing the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said there was an ""extremely strong resemblance"", between the militant in the videos and Emwazi. Mr Qureshi says he was in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria.

Foley's death was followed by the brutal killing of four more UK and US aid workers and journalists, all of whom were shown in footage next to a balaclava clad militant dressed in black, believed to be Jihadi John.

He is thought to have been featured in videos threatening the lives of Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed by the extremist group.

The name 'Jihadi John' came after it was reported that hostages referred to the militant as 'John' during their time captive.

Emwazi is reported to have started to become radicalised after a trip he planned to Tanzania. He and two friends were detained by police overnight after landing in Dar es Salaam and eventually deported.

It is claimed that Emwazi told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabaab operates.

Mr Qureshi says he met with Emwazi in the autumn after he returned from this trip to discuss what had taken place. “Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,” Mr Qureshi told The Post.

The Post reports that Emwazi then moved to Kuwait, his birthplace, and returned to London twice before being detained by counterterrorism officials in Britain, who took his fingerprints and searched his belongings.

He was allegedly prevented from returning to Kuwait, telling Mr Qureshi in an email: “I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started, but now I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.""

Mr Qureshi last spoke to Emwazi in 2012 when he contacted him for advice. He felt “actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions"", according to Mr Qureshi.

One friend said he believed Emwazi had wanted to teach English in Saudi Arabia but had been unsuccessful shortly before he disappeared.

“He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out,"" the friend was quoted as saying.

The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

The Home Office said it would neither confirm nor deny reports at this stage."
1940,"A hoax report filed by website nationalreport.net claimed the infamous artist had been arrested in London during a raid on his art studio.

The website – which describes itself as ""America's No.1 independent news source"" – said a man named Paul Horner from Liverpool had been nicked.

To complete the tale they quoted ""London police chief"" Lyndon Edwards who apparently held a press conference to announce the arrest. A press conference apparently attended by no reporters or TV crews.

HOAX: The false report claiming Banksy had been arrested [NATIONALREPORT]
Most hilariously of all the article was written by one Darius Rubics who has ""won numerous awards for journalism including a Peabody Award and a Pulitzer Prize"".

Despite the ludicrous nature of the article some fell for it hook, line and sinker.

Former Tory MP Louise Mensch, never shy of sharing her opinion with the world, said: ""You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy?

""There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?""

She did later apologise after being duped.


There are so many problems with the hoax we've decided to list some of the best ones for you.

– The article claims Banksy is from Liverpool when all known evidence strongly suggests he is from Bristol.

– Other articles by Darius Rubics include: Dennis Rodman leaves US to talk with leaders of ISIS and Obama declares November national Muslim appreciation month.

– London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards doesn't exist. The top cop in London is Sir Bernard Hogan Howe.

– The article suggests Banksy was nicked in Watford which actually falls under the catchment of the Hertfordshire Police.

– In Britain police do not release mugshots of people after they have been arrested.

– Banksy's PR Jo Brooks, despite apparently being quoted in the original story, has tweeted saying it is a hoax."

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of E. Meyer Blvd. was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas."

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. “I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,” he said. “I have no doubt about its authenticity.”

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren that he had “asked Border Patrol” about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

“I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” he said on the program.

Hunter’s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman’s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly “confirmed” the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter’s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn’t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about “foreign nationals” being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter’s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.–Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

w.soundcloud.com

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named — making it difficult to verify."
1948,"Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012.

The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said that the slaying came in response to the airstrikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago.

Isis, whose chief spokesman came under State Department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video, the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder.

Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime.

A Facebook message from a support group, Free James Foley, urged patience “until we all have more information,” and asked that readers “keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it, adding a metatextual debate to a depiction of a man’s violent death.

Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity.

A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.”

In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.”

Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement.

Messages left with the Foley family were not returned.

A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.”

Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken."
1949,"There it was in the middle of a field, baking in the sun: a cache of grenades, rockets and guns. The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”

News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.

In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”

Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”

Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”

The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”

It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.

One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”

So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.

It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.

That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work."
1950,"Mounted with a cannon and leaving a trail of shells in its wake, a black pickup truck in the hands of jihadists in Syria has brought woe to a family of Texas City plumbers by way of the insignia on its driver-side door: “Mark-1 Plumbing”.

On Monday a Chechen-led group linked to the extremist group Ansar al-Deen, a sometime ally of Islamic State (Isis) and al-Nusra fighters, tweeted a photo of the black Ford F-250 in action near Aleppo. Since then, Mark Olberholtzer and his family near Houston have received hundreds of phone calls with questions and threats.

Attempts to call the Olberholtzer family, who own Mark-1 Plumbing, reached only a recorded message or a disconnected line. On Tuesday Mark Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News he was mystified: “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.” His son Jeff similarly expressed bafflement to KHOU local news: “We had no intentions or idea that this would happen.”

“To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror – it’s crazy. Never in my life would I think something like that,” the younger Olberholtzer told KHOU.

The Olberholtzers sold the truck in October 2013 to a nearby Houston dealership run by AutoNation, confirmed Marc Cannon, senior vice-president of AutoNation’s corporate communications. Cannon told the Guardian that AutoNation sent the truck to the Adesa auction house in Houston.

The car was sold on the auction block to a local used car dealer, though Adesa has not yet responded to requests to identify the dealer. An operator at the auction house told the Guardian the company has been bombarded by calls, and that she was surprised that neither the plumbers nor the jihadis had simply removed the logo.

From the port of Houston the Olberholtzers’ old F-250 likely made it to a dealership in eastern Europe, Africa or the Middle East, and within a few months changed hands several times before it finally reached a jihadist sympathizer. The truck then likely passed through Turkey’s porous border, which lies only a few hours’ drive from Aleppo and the chaotic battles so far removed from south-eastern Texas.

About erasing the logo, the elder Olberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News that AutoNation or one of the other middlemen “were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it”. The plumber of 32 years said his family has received death threats and that some of the callers “are really ugly”.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families,” his son told KHOU. “We have nothing to do with terror at all.”

His father had a message to the broader world: “I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth.”

A representative of Mark-1 Plumbing told CBS News that they plan to pursue legal action to force Twitter to remove the photo. The person said that sold vehicles would “most definitely” have the logo removed henceforth.

Auction houses, which make more profit the faster they turn products, usually sell used cars quickly, and exporters are often keen to pick up unwanted vehicles from lots. Those exporters then ship used cars into the sizeable market in developing nations, where a battered Ford can find a long second life, or where scavengers can resurrect a lemon or dismantle it for parts."

1956,"Islamic State fighters fed the mum cooked meat and rice before telling her it was the remains of her kidnapped son, a British dad who went to fight IS has revealed

Sick ISIS militants fed a desperate mum the mutilated remains of her son - after telling her it was cooked meat and rice, it was claimed today.

The son had been captured and taken prisoner by Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq.

The worried mum then bravely visited the terror group's headquarters in a bid to speak to her loved one.

ISIS fighters told the mum she should eat before seeing her son because she had travelled a long way.

However, after giving the mother cooked meat, rice and soup, she was horrified to be told she had just eaten her son.

British dad Yasir Abdulla, who left his home in Keighley, West Yorkshire to fight against ISIS, said he joined the battle against the terror group after being told this story.

He said: ""The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

""But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, 'You've just eaten him'.""

And after witnessing the horrors of the terror group up close, Yasir says they have 'hijacked Islam'.

""ISIS are wrong. They behead, burn and get those they are against do dig their own graves before they execute them,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to get captured by ISIS, that would be the worst thing. If I was defending I would fight to my last bullet and use that on myself.""

Yasir is aware of Brits joining ISIS but has not encountered any in battle. ""I have seen what Jihad John has done and I think that person needs to be captured and executed,"" he said.

The incident is the latest atrocity from the terror group.

It emerged this weekend that Islamic State militants blindfolded a 'gay' man, threw him from a roof then stoned his corpse in Syria.

Horrific images revealed by ISIS show the barbaric killing in front of a baying crowd carried out at a building in Raqqa.

It is believed the man was sentenced to death by a sharia court.

The man was described as being a 'child of Lot' and accused of committing acts of sodomy, according to the Daily Mail.

'Lot' is a reference to a prophet of God whose story in the Qu'ran is used to demonstrate Islam's supposed disapproval of rape and homosexuality.

The images appear to show the man was blindfolded and had his feet tied before being hurled onto rubble from a tall building.

Crowds then gather round and pelt the corpse with rocks.

It was the fourth time in a few weeks that the jihadist group has used the brutal execution method for alleged homosexuality .

Fighters from group Libyan Dawn have posed for pictures with aircraft

U.S. officials warn planes could be used to carry out terror attacks on 9/11

September 11 also marks anniversary of attack on US embassy in Libya

Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month.

Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera.

U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month.

A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport.

Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August

Officials have been warning for some time about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011.

'There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.'

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya.

Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS.

However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group.

Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya

Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn.

Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes.

Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army.

Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital.

Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

Fears: Nearly a dozen commercial planes are missing in Libya after a radical Islamic group overtook the international airport in the capital of Tripoli late last month.

Aftermath: Tripoli International Airport was overtaken by the group Libyan Dawn last month and now 11 aircraft for Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways are missing

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera television after the airport attack that the planes had been taken by another Islamic group, the Masked Men Brigade.

Mekkaoui said there is 'credible intelligence' that the Masked Men Brigade 'is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.

Sebastian Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, told the Free-Beacon that the planes could be used in two ways to strike North Africa or even as far as the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.

'The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,' Gorka, the Maj Gen Charles Horner chair at the Marine Corps University, said.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added.

U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down.

Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists, like Syria.

1959,"A man had his penis cut off by an angry mob for attempting to rape a teenager in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The incident took place after shocked members of the public saw the man in an alley, pinning a terrified girl to a wall.

  
(Representational Image).Reuters
The 40-year-old man, recognised as Suresh Kumar, soon found himself being dragged away by the hysteric mob while they decided to punish him in their own way, the Daily Star reported posting pictures of the incident and a severed penis thrown on the street.
The mob took the man to a local butcher shop, where he was beaten with sticks for more than an hour. Thereafter, they hacked his penis off with a meat cleaver and dumped the severed organ in the middle of the street. The man -- bloodied, bruised and unconscious -- was abandoned with no one willing to show any mercy, the Daily Mirror reports.
The Daily Star online, which first reported the story with a censored photograph of the cut penis, claims that its reporters have seen the picture but could not show it due to its graphic nature.
""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"" the tabloid quoted a local man Aamir Dhawan as saying.
""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hanged, and molested, and it's time it stopped,"" he said adding that the incident sent out a strong message to people with perverted mindset.
The police have condemned the attack, warning locals not to take law into their hands and telling those people who cut the man's penis to hand themselves in.?
 

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice,"" one police officer was quoted as saying."
1965,"The proliferation of online news outlets has democratized newsgathering, but it’s also updated the famous adage that “there’s a sucker born every minute” for the Internet age. And no circus attracts the suckers quite like the Arab-Israeli conflict. Not only will people believe anything about Israel; their editors will let them write it. And as we learned yesterday, pretty much every year someone will fall for the impossibly preposterous accusation known as the “flood libel.”

There are moments when biased coverage of Israel goes beyond mere opinion. Last year, the good folks at Vox, a notoriously error-ridden site, declared the existence of a bridge connecting the West Bank and Gaza. It was not a maddening mistake; it was, rather, kind of endearing. It was adorable, in its own way. But that such a bridge does not exist is an easily verifiable fact.

Same goes for New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren’s claim in 2012 that prospective Jewish construction in the West Bank would bisect the West Bank and make physical contiguity impossible. As was subsequently pointed out (and corrected accordingly), this was not even close to being true and Rudoren would have known as much had she glanced at a map.

And this week we were treated to another version of this story, though it’s one we hear often enough. It’s a bit of a hazing ritual: the Palestinians find someone they haven’t yet sold this particular lie to and watch the magic unfold. The lie is this: that flooding in Gaza was caused by Israel opening dams in the South. Easily the most important part of this story is the fact that there are no such dams. They are the Gaza-West Bank bridge of this story. And yet, the story just keeps appearing because the Palestinians never run out of Western suckers.

One of the suckers this year was Vice News. To try to hide its ignorance, Vice offered up several paragraphs of false accusations from the Palestinians followed by this attempt at “balance”: “Israeli officials categorically denied they were to blame while speaking to VICE News on Monday.”

Other outlets were more honest and ethical in the aftermath of publishing the flood libel. As HonestReporting notes, the Daily Mail went with a bit of false balance but also, crucially, added a straight correction and admission of error: “An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country, causing flooding in the Gaza strip. In fact, there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues. We are happy to clarify this.”

According to HonestReporting, the Daily Mail piece also contained the following amazing sentence: “The flooding was today compounded after an Israeli power company cut electricity to two of Gaza’s major West Bank cities.”

And according to CAMERA, both Agence France Presse and Al Jazeera (shocking, I know) passed along the flood libel. AFP pulled its video, and Al Jazeera went the Vice route by pretending the existence of magical dams is somehow in dispute.

The flood libel is proof that sometimes people refuse to learn from others’ mistakes. See this post from Jonathan Tobin in December 2013 for a reminder that the flood libel is neither new nor surprising. IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss understandably would rather news organizations first locate their unicorns before blaming those unicorns for goring the neighbor’s ox:


So why does this keep happening? Part of the frustration with reporters stems from their absolute laziness. The Internet has put so much information within arm’s reach, and yet reporters are taught that when it comes to Israel, the facts are optional. And that’s because the facts favor Israel.

If you were to draw a map of Israel, using Western news organizations’ reporting, you’d have one that showed Israel bisecting the West Bank while connecting it to Gaza via a bridge and holding parliamentary meetings in its capital of Tel Aviv. None of that is true, but that’s the picture that emerges from the media’s “reporting.”

There also appears to be a kind of modified Stockholm Syndrome at work. These reporters and the outlets they represent are constantly made to look like fools by Palestinian propaganda. But they also seem not to mind, because they sympathize so strongly with what the propagandists and terrorists are telling them.

If what I’m describing to you sounds an awful lot like an activist, not a journalist, well–that’s about right. And such activists play a key role in disseminating grist for the anti-Semitic mill. The first headline is the one that makes waves, especially in the Arab world and in Europe. If the follow-up is not a full retraction or correction, but rather a “balanced” piece in which Israel is permitted to deny the existence of things that plainly don’t exist, then it casts the Israeli government as a powerful entity engaged in a cover-up.

It would be bad enough if we were forced to admit that our media just can’t get the story right. But that’s naïve. The truth is, much of the time our media just won’t get it right. And that’s why the flood libel returns, year after year."

1967,"Palestinian officials say hundreds of Gazans were forced to evacuate after Israel opened the gates of several dams on the border with the Gaza Strip, and flooded at least 80 households. Israel has denied the claim as “entirely false.”

In the wake of a recent severe winter storm in the region, Israeli authorities opened the floodgates to discharge the accumulated water, Palestinian officials say. Residents of eastern Gaza reported injuries as well as deaths of livestock and poultry, caused by the Israeli action which allegedly came without prior notification, Gaza's Civil Defense Directorate (CDD) said Sunday.

Photos of the Gaza Strip flood have appeared in social networks, but the date when they were taken can't be independently verified as yet.


“The [Israeli] army opened the floodgates of a canal leading to central Gaza, which resulted in the removal of sand mounds along the border with Israel,” the CDD announced, according to Palestinian News Agency WAFA.

“Opening the levees to the canal has led to the flooding of several Palestinian homes, and we had to quickly evacuate the afflicted citizens.”

No casualties were reported as a result, but more than 80 families had to flee after their homes filled with water levels sometimes reaching more than three meters, the Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement.

In a letter to RT regarding the issue, Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) maintained that“the claim is entirely false.""

""Southern Israel does not have any dams. Due to the recent rain, streams were flooded throughout the region with no connection to actions taken by the State of Israel,” COGAT said.

The flood reportedly forced the closure of the main road connecting al-Mughraqa district and Nusseirat refugee camp south of Gaza city, leaving hundreds of Palestinians trapped in the floods, a difficult prospect for approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel’s assault last summer.

Evacuated families were taken to UNRWA-sponsored (UN Relief and Works Agency) shelters in the al-Bureij refugee camp and the al-Zahra neighborhood.


""Israel opened water dams, without warning, last night, causing serious damage to Gazan villages near the border. More than 40 homes were flooded and 80 families are currently in shelters as a result,” chief of the civil defense agency in Gaza, Brigadier Gerneral Said Al-Saudi, told Al Jazeera.

Local agriculture was also affected, Al-Saudi said. “We are appealing to human rights organizations and international rights organizations to intervene to prevent further such action.”

Further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams, warned Gaza Civil Defense Services (CDD) spokesman Muhammad al-Midana, as cited by the Ma'an news agency. A fast-moving water stream is currently flowing from the Israel border through the Gaza valley and into the Mediterranean Sea, he said.


The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) used to be a unique wetland ecosystem located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It flowed from two streams, one running from near Beersheba, and the other from vicinity of Hebron. There’s not much water left in Wadi Gaza, as water being mostly used upstream in Israel and the stream running through the Gaza Strip consists mainly of untreated waste from Gaza City, which pumps up millions of liters of sewage into the riverbed.

According to media reports, this is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the floodgates to their Gaza Valley dams to discharge massive quantities of excessive water that accumulated during heavy rains or snowfall."

Tony Zobl, 35, told the Canadian Press news agency that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl said.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

CBS says that Michael’s full name was Michael Abdul Zehaf Bibeau–and that he dropped the Michael after converting to Islam. At other times he apparently dropped the Abdul.

1971,"HUNTINGTON BEACH (CBSLA.com)  —  The viral video of a homeless man buying food for friends with $100 he had been given warmed the hearts of many of the more than 25 million people who clicked on it.
Donations came pouring in for the homeless man named Thomas. More than $130,000 donated from around the globe in about a week.
Josh Paler Lin, the YouTube personality who uploaded the nearly five-minute video, is telling everyone within earshot that the heartwarming viral video is real.
The homeless man’s brother, however, said that his brother is being scammed. Meanwhile, an eyewitness to the filming also believes the entire thing is a hoax.
The eyewitness told CBS2’s Stacey Butler that he saw Thomas in Lin’s car when Lin purported the man didn’t know he was being filmed. During the video, Lin can be heard telling his shooter, “Make sure he doesn’t see you.”
The homeless man’s brother also spoke to Butler.
In the video,  the homeless man is tracked to a convenience store that sold liquor. He buys food for other homeless people with the $100 he was given by Lin.
Lin later confronts the man and gives him another $100 because he said he assumed he was going to buy alcohol with the money and he couldn’t believe he was so generous with his friends.
In another eight-minute video, Lin takes Thomas out for a couple of meals, including shabu-shabu on Christmas Eve, provides him with a hotel room and a surprise makeover. Lin insists none of the videos were staged or scripted.
With hits to his YouTube channel (he joined in 2009), it’s already estimated that Lin made $52,000, not counting the Indiegogo fundraising  page he said he set up for Thomas. Lin’s channel also gained him nearly 15,000 new fans.
Critics have already pointed out that Thomas would have had to have walked  for at least 34 minutes to the Liquor Mart, passing cheaper supermarkets along the way. They also point out that a homeless and begging Thomas had a rather blase reaction for someone who had just received $100 from a stranger.
The eyewitness to the filming told Butler he knew Lin from his many prankster videos and said he definitely saw Thomas in Lin’s vehicle during set-ups.
“I was there,” says Taugan Kadalim, “they didn’t ‘follow’ him. They drove him there [to the liquor store.]
Kadalim believes Thomas, 56, is really homeless but that the entire video was staged.
“I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful,” Kadalim says, “And dishonest.”
Thomas’ brother, Kevin Nickel, reached out to CBS2.
“This isn’t right,” he said.
“In a surprising twist,” Butler reported, “he says his brother’s real name is Kenny Nickel. He said his brother is an alcoholic and lived with their parents until both died last summer.”
He said his brother was arrested for public intoxication and put in jail. Butler was unable to confirm his arrest record.
His brother also says Kenny is actually not broke. He is due $150,000 from his parents’ estate.
“He’s sitting on money,” Kevin said, not sure if his brother is even aware of the Indiegogo money being collected on his behalf. “But this is a scam. This money needs to go to people who really need it.”
Kevin fears his brother is being manipulated and that if he does get the money he uses it to get help."
1972,"Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, has become so fat while in office that his ankles have fractured under his own weight, it was reported on Tuesday.

The 31-year-old, who has looked increasingly portly since taking power, had to undergo a hospital operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a gruelling round of official engagements.

The treatment has also been linked to his unexpected failure to attend a recent session of the Supreme People's Assembly, according to a Pyongyang source who spoke to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper in neighbouring South Korea.

Unlike other members of North Korea's political elite, for whom a sudden absence from public life often means they have been killed or imprisoned, in Kim Jong-un's case it is said to be down to Elvis-style weight gain as a result of his unhealthy diet.

He is now believed to weigh at least 20 stone as a result of his fondness for heavy drinking and imported Swiss cheese, which he gained a taste for while at school in Switzerland.

His ankle injuries are said to have resulted from a long tour of military bases and factories while wearing shoes decked out with Cuban heels, which boosted his 5ft 9ins height but proved difficult to walk in. He is said to have suffered sprains on both feet first and then compounded the injuries by walking more, leading to the fractures.

Bodyguards have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he is now being treated. ""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" said the source. There was also speculation that a team of private European doctors had flown in to treat him.

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state television which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill."
1973,"(ANTIMEDIA) The KFC Corporation just acquired a Colorado licence to legally sell cannabis within the state.
According to some reports, nearly half of the KFC franchises in the state Colorado began selling cannabis last month.
“In order to be successful, a deep understanding of the market is critical to success. It’s all about evolution and we are ready to serve the needs of the people of Colorado,” KFC spokesperson William Rausch said in a statement.

 
Customers who want to buy cannabis with their genetically modified fried chicken will still need to prove that they are at least 21 years of age, with a valid government issued ID.
Interestingly enough, this weird phenomenon is something that “South Park” predicted years ago. In one episode of the hit comedy show, Randy Marsh gives himself testicular cancer with a microwave in order to get a prescription for medical marijuana. In the episode, all of the KFC locations in the town become marijuana dispensaries.
With this bold move, KFC becomes one of the first major fast food chains to offer this extra service, and it is possible that many others will follow in their footsteps. Fast food has been suffering financially in recent years, as consumers become more health conscious. While KFC may not be the best place to eat, the addition of cannabis to their menu definitely signals the beginning of a new era."
1974,"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola.

According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.

While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.

Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reports

UN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.

Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'

The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever

Mosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.

According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.

The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.

In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.

The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.

It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.

Yesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said.

The action in Syria included 17 strikes near the cities of Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani. A variety of Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units were hit.

In Iraq, 12 strikes targeted Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units near the cities of Mosul, Fallujah and Sinjar.

1975,"Video clips circulated online Tuesday that purported to show that Saudi state television blurred out First Lady Michelle Obama at a meeting between President Barack Obama and the new Saudi king.

However, observers of the live broadcast — including a Wall Street Journal reporter in the country — said that there was no blurring of Mrs. Obama, and that the broadcast showed her shaking hands with King Salman.

The Saudi embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement provided to Bloomberg View, the embassy’s information director said: “Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.” Various clips posted of the ceremony elsewhere show no blurring of Mrs. Obama or of her handshake with the new king.

The Obamas made a stop in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday on their way back from India to pay respects to the late King Abdullah and to meet with the new leader of a longtime American ally. The visit came amid continued criticism of Saudi Arabia’s policies regarding women’s rights, which served to put the interactions between the first lady and Saudi officials under a spotlight.

Mrs. Obama dressed conservatively, with long pants and long sleeves. The first lady didn’t wear a headscarf in the conservative Muslim country — a standard part of Saudi Arabia’s state-mandated dress code. But covering the head isn’t required for foreigners, though only 3% of Saudis believe that a women without a headscarf is appropriately dressed in public, according to a 2014 study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.

Her appearance drew notice on Twitter. Social media users tweeted using an Arabic hashtag that translates to #MichelleObama_NotVeiled.


 


 

Others wondered why she had covered her head on a previous trip, to Indonesia. The photos used were from a 2010 visit to the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta.

1976,"Sources in the Kurdish underground in Syria denied Sunday night that Canadian-Israeli Gill Rosenberg, 31, had been in the Kobane region, as claimed by Islamist and Palestinian websites that reported she was captured by ISIS during the fighting in that area. The report about Rosenberg's capture has not been confirmed by ISIS.

An American who is fighting in the ranks of the Kurds told Voice of Israel that Rosenberg was not in the Kobane region. “She was never in Kobane, that's not reasonable that she was captured,” he said. The head of the station's foreign news desk, Eran Sikorel, said that he, too, had information that Rosenberg had been stationed in eastern Syria and not in the Kobane region, which is in central Syria. 

Yisrael Hayom quotes a senior Kurdish source who confirmed that Rosenberg joined the Kurdish resistance in Syria and said she was the first western woman to join its fighters. The source added that ten other western citizens who are not of Kurdish origin have also joined the Kurdish fighters in recent days.

Earlier on Sunday, the monitoring group SITE said Islamic State (ISIS) jihadists claimed a ""female Zionist soldier"" had been captured in the embattled Syrian border town.

Some jihadists said the woman might be Rosenberg, who had served in the Israel Defense Forces and had volunteered to fight with the Kurds, the monitoring group said.

""The Government of Canada is aware of reports that a Canadian citizen was kidnapped in Syria,"" a foreign ministry statement said, according to AFP.

""Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels to seek further information and officials are in close contact with local authorities,"" added the statement.

Israel, too, said it was following reports about Rosenberg."
1978,"A Led Zeppelin reunion tour, backed by an astonishing amount of money put up by British billionaire Richard Branson, will never happen — because singer Robert Plant ripped up a contract that would have paid him about $300 million to play 35 concerts with the the legendary band in just three cities.

The information about the aborted Led Zeppelin reunion tour came from an exclusive report in Britain’s Daily Mirror newspaper, which said that the 66-year-old Plant — who during the 1970s heyday of Zeppelin was one of the world’s most successful and recognizable rock stars — simply didn’t believe it was “the right thing to do.”

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” said an anonymous source said by The Mirror to be close to Robert Plant. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

According to the Mirror story, the other two surviving members of Led Zeppelin — guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, and 68-year-old bass player/musical arranger John Paul Jones — had already signed their mega-contracts and were ready to set out on the tour, which would have taken them to London’s O2 Arena as well as Berlin and New Jersey.

But Plant just wasn’t into it.

Jason Bonham, the 48-year-old son of original Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, has also signed on to play drums as a salaried musician on the Zep reunion tour.

Led Zeppelin formed in 1968 and were considered the biggest rock act in the world through the early and mid-1970s. But they broke up in 1980 after John Bonham died in his sleep at age 32 following a heavy drinking binge.

Jason Bonham played drums with Led Zeppelin for the band’s one-off reunion performance during the Ahmet Ertugun Tribute Concert in 2007. Ertugun was the record label boss who signed Led Zeppelin to Atlantic Records, sight unseen, launching the then-unknown band’s meteoric career.

Branson, according to the Mirror, guaranteed the band more than $900 million to be split among the three original members, for the proposed Led Zeppelin reunion tour.

Plant’s share alone would have nearly tripled his current, already-formidable net worth, which is reported at $170 million.

According to the Mirror’s source, Page, Jones, and Bonham were stunned by Plant’s refusal to take part in the tour.

“It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock,” The Mirror quotes the source as saying. “There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Led Zeppelin fans can still get their dose of the legendary band through an ongoing series of remastered reissues of the original Led Zeppelin albums, a project being coordinated by Page."
1979,"Perth | A 600-pound woman has given birth to a 40-pound baby at Perth’s King Edward Memorial Hospital, a record breaking weight that could possibly make the newborn the largest baby ever born, reports the Western Australian Herald this morning.
The baby of gigantic size surprised doctors and staff members who were not fully prepared for such an event but miraculously managed to give birth to the 40-pound (18 kilos) baby who remains in a healthy state, has confirmed a hospital spokesman.

The single mother who’s delivery necessitated a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen and uterus was done to prevent any harm to the baby and mother’s health and was undergone without any complications.

The 600-pound woman was brought in emergency by ambulance, her family unable to carry her in an automobile
The doctor who practiced the cesarean section first believed the woman to be pregnant with twins or even triplets.

“I have dealt with other women suffering from obesity before but this birth will stick with me until I die” he told reporters with a large grin. “I truly believed there was two or even three babies in there” he commented laughingly, “but no, it was just one big sturdy guy. He obviously has a career as a future rugby player” he added with humor.
The largest recorded baby in the world was previously thought to be a South African baby who is believed to have weighted 38 pounds (17.2 kilos) and was born in 1839. The young boy of Zulu origin is reported to have grown to an impressive 7’6 feet or 2.28 meters high before he reached his 18th birthday."
1981,"A man caught allegedly attempting to rape a teenage girl was set upon by a vigilante group who hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver.

These horrifying pictures show Suresh Kumar, 40, after he was beaten with sticks for an hour before being castrated in the city of Ganganagar in India.

He was then left bleeding in the road next to his penis and testicles. He was later taken to hospital in a ""critical"" condition.

The girl was treated for shock and is being given counselling.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.  ""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.  ""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""

India has been plagued recently for a string of brutal sex attacks against women and public anger has swelled considerably following an number of high-profile cases.

Despite this, police have called for those responsible for the castration to come forward.

A police spokesman said: ""People cannot take the law into your own hands.  ""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them."
1982,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — Al-Shabaab’s top leader was traveling in one of two vehicles hit Monday night in a US military strike, a member of the Somali Islamic extremist group said Tuesday.

The spokesman would not say whether al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was among the six militants killed.

The two vehicles were heading toward the coastal town of Barawe, al-Shabaab’s main base, when they were hit, Abu Mohammed told the Associated Press. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions in the strike.

Al-Shabaab attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people, a year ago this month, and the US targeted planners of the bloody assault. US commanders were waiting to determine the attack’s outcome.

“US military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabaab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,” said Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the US strike in a forest south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the US and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

“Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,” said Mohamed Ali, who lives in the Sablale district. “They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.”

A senior Somali intelligence official said a US drone targeted Godane as he left a meeting of the group’s top leaders. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is the group’s spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al Qaeda. In 2012, the US offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest.

The Somali official, speaking on condition of anonymity since he was not authorized to speak to the media, said intelligence indicated Godane “might have been killed along with other militants.” The official said the attack took place 105 miles (170 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, where al-Shabaab trains its fighters.

As government and African Union forces were heading to a town in the district, they heard what sounded like an “earthquake” as the al-Shabaab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told the Associated Press.

“There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,” Nor said.

The US has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A US missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabaab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a US strike that killed al-Shabaab’s top explosives expert.

The latest US action comes after Somalia’s government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabaab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu’s Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia’s intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabaab had attacked the mall in Nairobi last year in retaliation against Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the attack was carried out in retaliation for the West’s support for Kenya’s Somalia intervention and the “interest of their oil companies.”

Al-Shabaab is now mostly active in Somalia’s rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabaab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting."
1983,"While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It's thought that the $350 price applies to the aluminum model of the watch. Certainly, $500 for the stainless steel version feels about right by comparison. The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

The iGen.fr sources also claim that Apple is hoping to release the watch as soon as possible—though other rumors claim we may have to wait until Spring of 2015. Either way, we have longer to wait before we find out more than we'd like. [iGen.fr via MacRumors]"

So much for idle millennials: a 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School student known around campus for spending his lunch breaks flipping stocks has reportedly amassed a $72 million fortune.

The student, Mohammed Islam, is profiled in this year’s edition of New York magazine’s annual treat, “Reasons to Love New York.” Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants, and he and a few other pint-size, hobbyist traders and poker players appear to have created a cool nerd gang for the ages—dining at Morimoto and Mari Vanna, where they toss back apple juice and caviar. They want to make a billion dollars next year (stay tuned). “But it’s not just about money,” Islam said. “We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers.”

One of Islam’s friends, whom the magazine describes as “the son of a Kazakh oligarch,” peppers the profile with references to The Wolf of Wall Street and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, but Islam seems to have a decent head on his shoulders, Koch brothers identification notwithstanding. He’s also somewhat of a comeback kid: after losing some money trading penny stocks at age nine, he swore off trading until he felt well versed in the principles of the game. Now look at him."
1988,"American photojournalist Luke Somers, held by al-Qaeda militants following his abduction in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in September last year, was killed during a failed rescue attempt early Saturday, according to his sister.

Lucy Somers said she learned of her brother's death from the FBI. ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" she said. Lucy Somers gave the comments to the Associated Press.

The claim nonetheless seemed to contradict a statement on the Yemen defense ministry's website carried by Reuters that suggested Luke Somers had been freed following a suspected U.S. drone strike Saturday in Yemen that killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants.

The drone struck at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, hitting a suspected militant hideout, according to an official who spoke to the AP. The official did not elaborate and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity as he wasn't authorized to brief journalists.

There was also no immediate comment from U.S. officials, who rarely discuss their drone campaign in Yemen.

Following the strike, the Al Arabiya news organization tweeted that ""reports suggest U.S. #journalists held in #Yemen freed,"" but there was no immediate confirmation of that report or the originating source.

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Somers, 33, says is certain his ""life is in danger.""

The video features an al-Qaeda official and a brief message from Somers — dressed in a purple shirt and with a shaved head — at the end. He notes that he was born in England but has American citizenship and lived in America for most of his life.

Josh Lin watched -- and filmed -- as the subject of his experiment entered a liquor store. Then he got a surprise.

What Lin witnessed left him stunned. The amateur filmmaker has made a name for himself on social media with pranks that capture the public’s reaction to unexpected situations. But in this case, Lin was the one caught off guard.

Al-Budairi held Anbar's operations chief Rashid Falih and new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi responsible for failing to immediately send army backup to the district.

ISIS, which already controls parts of Syria, has extended its reach into Iraq since June 10.

Violence conducted by the ISIS militants has claimed more than 1,400 lives in Iraq, and caused 1.2 million Iraqis, including Turkmens, Arabs, Christians and Ezidis, to flee their homes."
2003,"The New York Post is reporting this morning that the World Health Organization is looking into whether ISIS fighters in Iraq have Ebola. Yes, that’s two catastrophes combined.

And it’s not just the Post, Mashable had a piece earlier this week about reports from the Iraqi media that ISIS militants have contracted the disease. Their report, however, does contain some response from people with knowledge of whatever’s going on.

Firstly, a WHO spokesperson told them they’ve had “no official notification” from the Iraq government about the cases. And secondly, a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry called the reports “incorrect” and “unfounded,” citing, for one, the the lack of “diagnostic capablities” for doctors in Iraq to confirm cases of Ebola.

Suresh Kumar castrated in India

However, these Indian lynch mobs took laws into their own hands after they caught 40-year-old Suresh Kumar trying to rape a girl in a dark area in Ganganagar city of India.

He was severely beaten by lynch mobs who heard the girl's scream for help as Suresh attacked her.

After he was mercilessly beaten, Suresh was dragged to a nearby butcher's shop and a meat cleaver was used to chop of his manhood.

2009,"Twitter is abuzz with rumours that Cuba's former communist leader Fidel Castro has died, although the timing is suspiciously close to the death of another high-profile person who shares his name.

While reports of the death of Cuba's 88-year-old former leader could be true, there has been no official confirmation and his death has been mistakenly claimed on social media many times in the past.

Also casting doubt on today's rumours is the possibility it has been confused with the recent death of the son of Nairobi's opposition leader, named Fidel Castro Odinga, 41, who died only days ago.

Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, pictured during a speech in 2003. Twitter is abuzz with rumours he has died, but it remains to be seen if they are correct

However, speculation is rife that the former leader of Cuba has died after Venezuelan media reports the Cuban Government has called for a press conference with the international media today. Venezuela and Cuba have fostered a close relationship for decades.

The report in the Diario de Cuba, didn't specify a time or subject for the press conference, saying that the Cuban government's press office wouldn't give out the information..

It has also been claimed Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has rushed to Havana, adding some substance to the rumours that Castro's death could be announced.

Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to his brother Raul in 2008, was announced Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state.

Cuba's Fidel Castro (pictured left in 1976 and right in 1978) ushered in a long period of communism to the tiny island in what developed into a highly antagonistic relationship with the U.S.

He has lived in increasing seclusion from the outside world ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering.

It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants.

Today his former Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Perez Silva told various outlets: 'Fidel is waiting for the right moment, because he is a great prophet who knows the right moment to say what needs to be said.'"
2010,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video."

Doctors of the Carlos III hospital confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first case of human death caused by the ingestion of genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died from anaphylaxis after eating some recently developed tomatoes containing fish genes, which provoked a violent and lethal allergic reaction.
This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the 31-year old Spanish man who died  at the Madrid hospital in the beginning of January. The young man’s health rapidly deteriorated after he suffered an unexplained allergic reaction, and all the drugs used to refrain the anaphylaxis were entirely inefficient. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that the genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.
Mr. Ramos was working as a clerk in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, when he started feeling ill just after lunch. A number of symptoms started to manifest themselves, including a violent itchy rash, some serious swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected himself some epinephrine, but his health condition continued to deteriorate.
The young man was rapidly carried to the hospital by co-workers, but the medical staff was unable to identify the cause of his allergic reaction in time and none of the usual treatments or drugs seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was confirmed dead just over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

2015,"A Texas plumber was left bewildered after a truck he sold last year resurfaced this week — in the hands of Syrian rebels.

One of Mark Oberholtzer's old work trucks appeared in a photo tweeted by a Syrian rebel group, prompting an influx of threatening phone calls to the plumber.

His truck, with its original decal for ""Mark 1 Plumbing"" and a phone number for the business, is reportedly being used by the militant group to transport an anti-aircraft gun.

The original tweet, below, was posted to an account associated with the Jabhat Ansar al-Din militant group based in Syria. Oberholtzer traded in his truck to a Texas dealership that then placed it up for auction in 2013.

""We had no intentions or no idea this would even happen,"" Oberholtzer said in the video by local television station KHOU. ""Something that we would use to pull trailers and things like that, I mean, to now a truck to be used in terror, I mean that's crazy.""

In an interview with KHOU, Oberholtzer said he's had to take his phones off the hook due to angry and threatening calls from across the United States.

His phone number appears on the bottom of the truck, while the the full company logo and name remains on the side.

It is unclear how the car ended up thousands of miles away in the Aleppo province of Syria. Jabhat Ansar al-Din is an alliance of smaller militant factions established in July 2014 that functions in the hotly contested Aleppo area.

According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, the group is made up of the Green Brigade, Jaish al-Muhajrin, Sham al-Islam and Harakat Fajr al-Sham, which includes both local and foreign fighters.

2016,"Since the U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State, Republicans have frequently connected the terrorist group to border security in the U.S. In August, Texas Governor Rick Perry called it a “very real possibility” that fighters from the Islamic State had already crossed into the U.S.

On Tuesday night, Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California, took those comments even further. Appearing on ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren,"" Hunter said, “At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.” When Van Susteren asked how he knew that, Hunter replied, “Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.”



I asked the Department of Homeland Security if Hunter’s comments were true. They weren't.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” said DHS spokesperson Marsha Catron. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

UPDATE: Hunter isn't backing off his comments, claiming they came from a ""high-level source"" at DHS.""The Congressman was conveying what he knows—and what he was told,"" Hunter's spokesperson told The Huffington Post.

2017,"Actor Christian Bale is in talks to play the leading role in the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic being produced by Sony, reports Variety. Leonardo DiCaprio was originally in talks to play Jobs, but withdrew from negotiations earlier this month.

Penned by Aaron Sorkin, the Steve Jobs biopic was originally set to be directed by ""The Social Network"" director David Fincher, who was said to be in talks with Sony earlier this year, but the director title went to Danny Boyle instead, who also directed the hit movie ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

When David Fincher was still attached to the project, he reportedly was hoping to cast Christian Bale in the lead role due to his undeniable resemblance to the former CEO. Christian Bale is also known for his ability to adapt to roles, shedding and gaining weight as necessary to accurately portray characters.

Ashton Kutcher famously starred as Steve Jobs in the ""JOBS"" movie that focused on the former Apple CEO's younger years, but the Sony film will be quite different, using material from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography. The film, which has yet to receive a release date, will focus on three separate 30-minute scenes depicting three of Apple's product launches."

2022,"A newspaper report that Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized for ankle surgery has fuelled new theories about the North Korean leader’s long absence from the public eye.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. Since an event with key officials in July, he has been seen walking with a limp. In an unusual acknowledgment last Friday, North Korean state television said he was experiencing “discomfort.”

Details from the Hermit Kingdom on Kim’s state of health are scarce and hard to verify, but the new details reported by the Chosun Ilbo newspaper paint a broader picture of what may have happened to him. Here is what is suspected so far.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. He is shown below in photos released by the Korean Central News Agency on Oct. 9, 2010, at left, and July 28, 2014, at right:

Kim is believed to be between 5-foot-2 and 5-foot-9, possibly weighing 280 pounds. Chosun Ilbo cited a recent visitor to North Korea (whom it did not identify) as saying that Kim’s weight gain, combined with an intense tour schedule of factories and military bases, as factors in his ankle injury.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the source cited by Chosun Ilbo said. The source said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society. “It’s unusual but it’s possible,” Hepburn said in a telephone interview. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.

North Korea observers speculate Kim’s weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. “Based on his gait, it appears he has gout – something [due to] diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,” said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn’t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

“Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,” said Hepburn of the U.K. Gout Society. “It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flareups, which cause more pain.”

Chosun Ilbo’s report also said that Kim was believed to be wearing shoes with Cuban heels, a style of two-inch high-heeled men’s footwear, to make him taller and give him a more authoritative appearance. Kim is shown below wearing such shoes in a 2012 appearance with his wife, Ri Sol-ju:"
2024,"The artist posted a poignant image in the wake of the shooting that killed 12 at the offices of the French satirical magazine in Paris yesterday

Thousands of Banksy fans have shared this strong pictorial response to the terror attack at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Masked gunmen stormed the offices in Paris, claiming the lives of 12 and leaving five more seriously injured, yesterday.

Among the dead were four of France’s most celebrated political cartoonists, Jean Cabu, Stephane “Charb” Charbonnier, Bernard “Tignous” Verlhac and Bernard Maris.

The following image was posted via this Instagram yesterday, which has since been shared by over 100,000 people:

However, a spokesperson for Banksy told The Independent: ""We can confirm this is not by Banksy.""

The account is actually one of many fakes (Twitter handles @Banksyofficial and @therealbanksy are also fake) set up in the street artist's name.

The drawing appears instead to be the work of illustrator Lucille Clerc:

His reaction follows that of Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who released this statement.

“Very little seems funny today,” he concluded.

Gerard Biard, Charlie Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: “I don’t understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.”

Barack Obama, David Cameron and Angela Merkel have all condemned the “barbaric” killings and vowed to stand up for freedom of expression.

Seven of the gunmen suspected of being involved in the attack have since been arrested. An 18-year-old accomplice also handed themself in to a police station.

2025,"With the threat of an ISIS terror attack becoming ever more real, Iraqi media reported yesterday that some of the group’s militants have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, although World Health Organization officials have yet to confirm the reports.

An International Business Times article from today confirms that three Iraqi news outlets reported that Ebola showed up at a hospital in Mosul, a city 250 miles north of Baghdad which has been under ISIS control since June 2014.

Christy Feig, WHO’s director of communications, casted doubt on the report though, telling reporters, “We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.”

On top of that, it isn’t clear whether any disease experts or doctors in Mosul are even able to test for the Ebola virus. A Kurdish official, who was convinced the cases are Ebola, told the Kurdish media outlet Xendan that the militants’ symptoms were similar to those of the Ebola virus.

Nonetheless, Ebola symptoms, like nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding, are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses, and the Marburg virus.

Iraq’s pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, reported that the disease arrived in Mosul from “terrorists” who came “from several countries” in Africa.

According to a Washington Post report, the majority of the ISIS’ African fighters came from Tunisia, while others came from Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia — none of which reported any Ebola cases in 2014.

Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst with the Levantine Group, said that over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul.

“U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,” he said.

Decker added, “In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.”"

We’re told by several insiders that staffers at the fashion bible are still seeing rodents at Condé Nast’s new 1 WTC digs, which are still under construction.
A source told us editors spotted at least one critter this week under a desk, and immediately notified Anna Wintour.
“They were petrified, and told Anna, ‘We found rats under our desk,’” a source claims. “One said, ‘There’s a rat on top of my desk.’”
But Wintour replied, “I don’t want to hear about it,” according to our source. A different source also told us there’s “still a rat problem” at the office.
But a Vogue insider insisted there’s no rat issue and Wintour did not dismiss employees’ concerns. “That conversation never happened,” the source sniffed.
Vogue was one of the first glossy titles to move into Condé’s new downtown headquarters, but the rodents seemed to have beaten Wintour and her team to the tower’s 25th and 26th floors.

2032,"Kim Jong Un, North Korea's young dictator, sits at the top of a nation that for decades has enshrined the ruling Kim dynasty as demigods. The personality cult that surrounds the hermit kingdom's leadership is one of the strange realities of this pariah state, spawning eerie totalitarian spectacles and the most vigorous displays of clapping the world has ever seen.

It also leads to whole ranks of the population having to surrender their names.

According to a new report on a South Korean TV station, North Korean authorities issued a directive in 2011 — when Kim Jong Un came to power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il — to reject birth certificates of newborns named Kim Jong Un and to revise the official documentation and identity cards of those who still had that name.

“All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong Un … and train them to voluntarily change their names,” read the document, which was revealed by the KBS TV station on Tuesday.

“Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip … regarding this project,” it said.

The document had been obtained by a North Korean defector who reached South Korea in 2008. As is often the case with these sorts of revelations, its authenticity cannot be independently confirmed.

But the order, if true, should not come as a surprise. Both Kim's father and grandfather Kim Il Sung instituted the same vanity project, insisting on being the first and last holders of their names. The practice has echoes in the deep history of East Asian kingdoms but, like much else in North Korea, really ought not have a place in the 21st century."
2033,"Adding to Apple's iOS 8 launch troubles, a report on Monday claims the operating system's ""Reset All Settings"" feature for hardware wiping user preferences also deletes data stored in iCloud Drive.

As discovered by MacRumors, the issue presents itself when iPhone and iPad users attempt to reset preferences via the device's Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings option. The feature allows users to troubleshoot possible iOS issues by reverting all system settings back to factory baselines.

As OS X 10.10 Yosemite, and subsequently iCloud Drive, is not yet available for consumer download aside from Apple's public beta testing program, the effects on consumers are non-existent. However, with a large number of untrained public beta participants opting in to the service with iOS 8, the problem could become serious.

According to the report, one iPad user performed the reset and found his local iWork documents deleted, which consequently wiped those same documents from the cloud when the tablet synced to iCloud. It appears only data from first-party apps connected to iCloud Drive are affected by the bug, though not all users are seeing the issue play out as described.

In some cases, files are being delete upon syncing with iCloud, while other data remains untouched. It is suggested that users back up iCloud Drive documents to a local computer prior to performing the Reset All Settings operation.

iCloud Drive is Apple's solution to cloud storage, syncing and collaboration. The system allows seamless file transport and storage across iOS, OS X and Windows, while enabling advanced features like document editing, asset tagging and drag-and-drop data management.

2037,"The Canadian woman who was reportedly kidnapped by ISIS has said she is fine, and that rumors of her capture spread on jihadist websites are untrue.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, joined the ranks of the Kurdish peshmerga fighting force this year, which has elite all-female units.

ISIS sources reported Sunday that Rosenberg was captured in the contested town of Kobane, on the Turkish border, and were gleefully debating whether to execute her or try to negotiate a prisoner swap.

But now Rosenberg, who leaves sporadic updates about her campaign against extremism on Facebook, has posted to clarify that she is in fact alive and well.

She wrote: 'Guys, I'm totally safe and secure. I don't have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security.

'I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bu*****t news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured.'

Sources in the Kurdish militia also confirmed that she is unharmed and was not captured.

Idris Nassan, an official in Kobane, said he had been told by peshmerga members she is fine, and dismissed the reports of propaganda..

Even when the initial reports came out, some sources were sceptical and said Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobane in the first place.

Rosenberg, a joint citizen of Israel who served in the Israeli Defense Force, went to fight against the so-called Islamic State earlier this month, while they were locked in combat over Kobane, a town on the Turkey-Syria border.

She had earlier posted on social media explaining her decision to go and fight, declaring she sympathized with the Kurds, whose territory has come under heavy assault.

Her position in the Israeli military is thought to have been a non-combat role.

After the reports over the weekend of her capture, Canadian and Israeli government sources said they were investigating the possibility.

IS jihadists began advancing on Kobane on September 16, hoping to quickly seize the small town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border, following advances it made in Iraq.

At one point, it looked set to overrun the town, but Kurdish Syrian fighters, backed by coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, have held back the group.

""Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots,"" said Gurman.

The new 12-inch MacBook Air is said to be smaller than its 13-inch sibling and a bit thinner than the 11-inch version. It is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller than the latter, which allows it to keep a slightly bigger display. The bezels around the display have also been reduced, giving the front part of the machine a brand new look.

Much of the larger proportion of the machine's usable area will be occupied by the display panel and the keyboard. Apple has noticeably deviated from the standard keyboard of the MacBook Air by cramming the keys in order to decrease the spaces in between.

Other key changes include the transferring of the power button from the upper left-hand corner to the left side of the escape key and the removal of the travel on the track pad as a way to keep the laptop's slim build.

The new MacBook Air is also a minimalist when it comes to ports as it will only be sporting two, namely the headphone jack and a USB Type-C port. This means that fans of the machine will have to do away with the Thunderbolt connection and the MagSafe charger.

However, the specs of the new USB indicate that the Type-C can support driving displays and device charging.

""The new USB Type-C connector is smaller, faster, and more capable than the standard USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports on existing computers,"" added Gurman.

Apple is yet to make an official announcement on the new MacBook Air. The laptop is speculated to ship in mid-2015 and is expected to use one of the new dual-core Broadwell chips from Intel."
2042,"There's a story currently making the rounds about an Australian man who, upon returning from a trip to Bali, discovered that a spider burrowed under his skin and traveled up to his chest. Freaky? Yes, but it's also not plausible.

Rest easy, arachnophobes. You do not have to worry about Charlotte weaving her web beneath your flesh. The supposed story goes like this: Dylan Thomas (a 21-year-old man, not the dead poet) was on vacation in Bali and woke up one morning to discover a red ""trail"" of irritation running from his navel to his chest, a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day.

Thomas says that, after initially being sent home with antihistamines, he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin. Supposedly, they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar. According to Thomas, his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body. Thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days.

It's the kind of story that has a lot of people saying, ""NOPE,"" and a lot of arachnologists saying simply, ""No, that didn't happen."" Thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh, but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did.

""I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible,"" Christopher Buddle, associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, told us in an email. ""Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.""

Dr. Charles E. Griswold, Schlinger Curator of Arachnology (Emeritus) at the California Academy of Sciences, said he couldn't comment on this particular incident, but was similarly skeptical. ""[I]n general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that,"" he wrote.

Could it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from Thomas' body? Maybe, but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen. Buddle told us, ""Other arthropods (e.g., ticks/mites/perhaps some insects) could 'possibly' be 'associated' with something like this… perhaps... But certainly not a spider.""

Marie Herberstein, Head of the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in New South Wales, doesn't fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider, though she writes, ""I have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature (there are no parasites amongst spiders)."" But she also suspects it may be a different animal. She told us, ""My initial reaction is that this is a mite (also 8-legged) rather than a spider, and mites are renown[ed] for this type of behaviour, such as in scabies. Let's see what the identification brings.""

2043,"A woman dumped by her boyfriend spent an entire week sitting in a KFC eating chicken wings.

Depressed Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, decided she needed some finger licking good comfort food to get over her ex and turned to what she enjoyed most - Kentucky Fried Chicken.

She said: ""I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

""I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

""I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.""

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to get concerned.

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: ""We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through. At first no one really noticed her.

""But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

""When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think. And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.""

He said the woman wasn’t doing anyone any harm so they let her stay.

He added: ""She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.""

Story continues below the slideshow:

After a week Shen decided she’d had enough when local media turned up and decided to write about her.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: ""I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.""

2044,"A married TV actor who met a young woman and kissed her in a sauna woke up to find his testicles had been stolen.

Dmitry Nikolaev, 30, is believed to be the target of a gang – including a doctor – which may be harvesting organs to sell on the black market.

Nikolaev had a drink with a young blonde woman he met at a bar in a Moscow theatre before she invited him to a sauna, reports MailOnline.

A police source told the website: ‘They kissed and had some more beer and after that the actor remembers nothing.’ They believe Nikolaev’s drink was spiked.

He woke up the next day at a bus stop in acute pain and noticed blood on his trousers.

At the hospital staff told him that his testicles had been removed and that it appeared the operation had been done by a medical professional.

Police believe the gang is stealing human organs to sell on the black market.

2045,"Amazon has warehouses — hundreds of them, miles of them. It has lockers and pop-up shipping containers. But it's never had a true, physical retail store, at least not until now. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Amazon plans to open its first physical store, and that it will be located in midtown Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City. It'll be located on 34th Street, right between the flagship Macy's store and the Empire State Building.

In a way, the store will reportedly be just an extension of what Amazon already does in its physical spaces. Amazon will accept returns at the location, and will use it as a mini-warehouse particularly tuned for same-day delivery of products in New York. You'll also be able to pick up online orders at the store, meaning you'll be able to buy online and get items even faster. Amazon may also use the store to show off its Kindle and Fire products, which seems like a spectacularly obvious thing to do but is evidently still only being considered.

Of course, there's potential to do much more. Amazon's been building to this: the company launched a tool for identifying products, a card-reader for buying them, and much more that suggests it could quickly build a full-fledged physical retail space. It's been rumored for years that Amazon would do this, and even now Amazon tells the Journal that this is just an experiment.

The store is apparently slated to be open in time for the holidays, and could be the beginning of an entirely new branch of competition between Amazon and its biggest brick-and-mortar competitors."

2052,"It’s been a tough month for factchecking. After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled, readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news. And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is —to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview—”not true.”

Monday’s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market. Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number, “Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the “’high eight figures.’” The New York Post followed up with a story of its own, with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline: “High school student scores $72M playing the stock market.”

And now it turns out, the real number is … zero.

In an exclusive interview with Mr. Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov, the baby faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean. Swept up in a tide of media adulation, they made the whole thing up.

Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm, 5WPR and handled by a phalanx of four including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell&Mermelsein, Mr. Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader—a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC.

Here’s how it happened.

Observer: What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter?

Mohammed Islam: “My friend’s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me. Then she [Jessica Pressler] called me.”

You seem to be quoted saying “eight figures.” That’s not true, is it?

No, it is not true.

The Post trumpeted the boys' investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)
The Post trumpeted the boys’ investment success, as did New York magazine. (screencap)

Is there ANY figure? Have you invested and made returns at all?

No.

So it’s total fiction?

Yes.

Are you interested in investing? How did you get this reputation?

I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades.”

If you had been playing with real money, would you have done really well?

The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S&P.

Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the $72 million figure?

I honestly don’t know. The number’s a rumor.

She said ‘have you made $72 million’?

[I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades.

At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law & Order style objections. A conference outside the room ensued. Back into the room came Mr. Islam.

All I can say is for the simulated trades, I was very successful. The returns were incredible and outperformed the S&P.

Damir, tell me where you fit into this.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Well, I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey, let me get on board. I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica.

But you guys are pals outside of this?

We go to social gatherings and friends’ places.

Are you into stockpicking as well?

I haven’t been into it but I’m interested.

Mohammed, you’re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school. Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance?

Mohammed Islam: In my immediate family, just me.

So what did your parents think when they’re reading that you’ve got $72 million?

Mohammed Islam: Honestly, my dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she’d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. … They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven’t spoken to them since.

You haven’t? Where did you sleep last night?

Mohammed Islam: At a friend’s house. But we didn’t sleep.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We stayed awake all night. We’ve been checking out news all over the world.

Are your friends blowing up your phones?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn. All the friends shared it.

Mohammed Islam: It was hyped up beyond belief.

Damir Tulemaganbetov: We were at CNBC. That’s why we’re dressed up. But we were there and literally in the building stressing out. We had 20 minutes. Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk?

[The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance.]

Where do you go from here?

Damir Tulemaganbetov: Socially, people will be mad about it. But we’re sorry. Especially ot our parents. Like my dad would read this and be like ‘Oh My God’ because he’s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father.

Mohammed Islam: At school, first things first. I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused. The people I’m most sorry for is my parents. I did something where I can no longer gain their trust. I have one sister, two years younger, and we don’t really talk.

 

So that’s that. There was no $72 million, no “eight figures,” not even one figure. The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York’s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible. New York has now altered its headline to back away from the $72 million figure but the story itself remains. Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796% over the three years since. C’mon, man.

It’s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York, which placed Mr. Islam’s alleged acumen at No. 12 in its 10th annual “Reasons to Love New York” issue. Ms. Pressler quoted him saying, “It’s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers …” Yep, nothing says success—or search engine optimization—quite like “Koch brothers.”

No one asked for my opinion, but I’m going to provide it anyway, having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day. They got carried away. They’re not children. But they’re not quite adults, either, and at least Mr. Islam was literally quaking as we spoke. So yeah, they probably should have known better. But New York and the New York Post probably should have, as well. This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men—and a couple reporters—some embarrassment.

2053,"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN.

South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said.

At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking.

Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule.

After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him, in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district.

Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera. Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills.

He skipped important anniversary

Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea.

Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation.

Since his reappearance, North Korea has released several photos of Kim, but has yet to release video.

According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She said both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress.

After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have swollen due to painkillers. She also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea.

2054,"After a disastrous iOS 8.0.1 rollout and a ton of publicity surrounding Bendgate, saying that Apple had a bad week is an understatement.

Unfortunately for Apple, things aren't looking much better this week, as MacRumors reports on a particularly nasty iOS 8 bug, which could potentially erase the iWork documents stored in your iCloud drive.

According to the report, the option to ""Reset All Settings,"" found under Settings — General — Reset in iOS 8, also deletes documents from the iCloud Drive — permanently.

The option, which normally resets settings to factory defaults, clearly states that ""no data or media will be deleted."" However, after some users on MacRumors' forum complained about the bug, MacRumors tested the option out, and indeed, all the iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive both on the iPhone and on iCloud.com were gone.

Even worse, after iCloud synced with a Mac running OS X Yosemite, the documents were deleted from the Mac as well. Some of the documents — including Preview and TextEdit files — were untouched, but all iWork files seem to be affected.

In some scenarios it's possible to retrieve these files from a backup folder, or via Time Machine, but nothing is certain at this point, and Apple still hasn't publicly acknowledged the bug. For now, iOS 8 users who have iCloud Drive enabled should probably avoid using the ""Reset All Settings"" option.

2058,"INNOVATIVE might not be the first word that comes to mind when describing US telephone and cable company Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due?

Let’s face it, after a harrowing 18-minute customer service call went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for — it had reached peak horrible. Yet, if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer’s employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.

The full story in all its sadistic glory is at Consumerist, but here’s the SparkNotes version. A customer named “Conal” started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren’t applied. Conal considered cancelling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he’d never ordered.

This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast’s billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal’s employer — a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.

It’s hard to know who’s telling the truth here. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That’s a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company’s name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring “for quality assurance purposes.” If you want it done right, record the call yourself.

2060,"The two biggest news stories of 2014 collided Wednesday when Iraqi media outlets reported that members of the Islamic State group -- also known as ISIS -- had contracted the deadly virus Ebola. But later updates from the World Health Organization and Iraq's Ministry of Health indicate the stories may be just rumors.

""We have no official notification ... that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, director of communications for WHO, told Mashable, though WHO has contacted Iraqi officials to offer help.

Iraq's Ministry of Health also denied that anyone in Mosul had contracted the Ebola virus, which broke out in March in West Africa. Spokesman Ahmed Rudaini told news site Al-Maalomah that Mosul doesn't even have the technological capability to diagnose Ebola cases -- only Baghdad does. Therefore, he said, the reports that Ebola has infected anyone in Mosul are ""incorrect"" and ""unfounded.""

The discussion started with an article in Iraq's official newspaper, Al-Sabah, that said ""terrorists"" brought Ebola to Mosul. ""Many diseases and epidemics have spread among residents of the city of Mosul,"" it read. ""Two Ebola and 26 HIV/AIDS cases were registered.""

Ebola is primarily a threat in West Africa, where its latest outbreak has killed nearly 8,000 people. Mashable reported ISIS has not recruited fighters from any countries severely affected by the disease. Its African members are primarily from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia.

In the event ISIS does have Ebola, the militants could use it as a biological terror technique, Forbes reported in October. Members could contract the virus on purpose and then go to foreign countries to infect others. “The individual exposed to the Ebola virus would be the carrier,” national security professor Al Shimkus told Forbes. “In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn’t take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.”

ISIS, a body of militants labeled a terrorist group by the United States and European Union (among others), has controlled Mosul since June. Iraq's second-largest city is also ISIS' largest stronghold. The group began spreading across the Middle East last summer, taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria through brutal tactics."

2062,"Holy crap, Batman -- look what happened to a a once-distinguished news organization.

The CBS Detroit broadcast group's website posts a 10-paragraph article, if that's the right word, about something that may or may not have happened:

A website is reporting that the Batmobile, from the upcoming Batman v. Superman flick, has gone missing in Detroit and is presumed stolen.  

Sounds serious and dramatic. And yet no other local media outlet has a word about it. 

Further reading suggests why.

""Presumed stolen"" refers to a presumption by the anonymous writer of a four-paragraph post at Bleeding Cool, an Illinois site for comic book fans. Its brief item begins:

The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen. 

That site adds: ""Warner Bros representatives did not respond to inquiries.""
The CBS Detroit writer, Evan Jankens, also makes a nod to verification:

Our brother station WWJ put a call into the Detroit Police Department to see if there is any truth to this. (Update! As of 4 p.m., police were saying they hadn’t heard about this, but were looking into it).

Members of the broadcast group are WWJ-TV (Channel 62), WWJ Newsradio 950 and two sports radio stations.

Absent any confirmation, Jankens riffs speculatively on the notion of a possible Batmobile-jacking:

If this is true I could only imagine seeing it driving down 696 in rush hour.
Seriously, how the heck could someone steal this car? . . . No, it’s the BATMOBILE! It has machine guns in the front.
Does this person — if the rumor is true (we don’t know how credible the source is) — think that he or she can just go cruising around in this car no one will notice?
Hey, we like Friday afternoon playfulness as much as the next keyboard jockey, but stay on the other side of publishing a story from someone else's anonymous source that requires disclaimers such as ""if the rumor is true"" and ""we don't know how credible the source is.""

That wouldn't slide past a high school student publication adviser and it seems like a disservice to readers of CBS Detroit, which didn't share the wispy piece on its Facebook pages and presumably not on its newscasts.

The contrasting tweets below show two approaches to the Bleeding Cool short. The first was sent by CBS Detroit's writer to the film director after publication, while the second was posted instead of a preliminary article."

Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, no longer wants to enter the building because of its rat problem.

Vanity Fair Editor-in-Chief Graydon Carter said rats continue to occupy the new Conde Nest offices at One World Trade Center.

""A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,"" said a different source. ""They ate through his rug to fit under his door.""

2067,"President Barack Obama denounced Islamic State (Isis) militants for murdering an American journalist in retaliation for US air strikes in Iraq, showing an anger he has rarely displayed in remarks about the Iraq conflict.

“No just god would stand for what they did yesterday and every single day,” Obama said Wednesday in brief remarks from Edgerton, Massachusetts, where he is vacationing.

Hours after US intelligence authenticated a gruesome Isis videotape showing the execution of captive journalist James Foley, an act committed with the goal of deterring future US strikes on Isis, Obama said that Isis “has no place in the 21st century,” and called on allies to help defeat a “cancer so it does not spread.”

Obama did not announce any intensification of his bombing campaign, now in its thirteenth day. US Central Command has yet to announce any new strikes since the Tuesday appearance of the social-media-borne Foley video, although sporadic reports from Iraq have indicated some may have taken place Wednesday.

An emotional Obama ran through a litany of Isis human-rights abuses, from rape to enslavement, calling them “cowardly acts of violence.” In a vague reference to Americans held captive by Isis or near its path in Iraq, Obama said the US would “do everything we can to protect our people,” a formulation that has preceded US military action in the past.

With the death of the first American in Iraq since the US military withdrew in 2011, pressure is mounting on Obama to expand his already growing and amorphous air war against Isis.

The stated purpose of nearly two weeks of bombing has moved from the rescue of mostly Yazidi Iraqi civilians at risk of genocide to providing air cover for Kurdish and Iraqi forces wresting the strategically vital Mosul Dam away from Isis. Aides to Obama pointed out from the start that threats to critical infrastructure would likely prompt a US reprisal.

Buffeted between calls to destroy Isis and criticism of their shifting rationale, Obama and the Pentagon have strenuously objected to a charge of mission creep. They point out the consistency of the goals Obama has articulated since 8 August: preventing humanitarian catastrophe and protecting US personnel in Iraq.

Yet both are broad enough to encompass aerial protection of Iraqi Kurdistan and the destruction of Isis vehicles, artillery and fixed positions from Mount Sinjar to the Mosul Dam. The murder of Foley – delivered after he gave a statement at knifepoint blaming the US for his death – and Isis’s threat to kill another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is also testing Obama’s goal of safeguarding US nationals in a country overrun by Isis.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Wednesday that the video showed both Foley and Sotloff.

Leaders from the UK, France and other countries lined up to excoriate Isis for the slaying. British prime minister David Cameron called it “shocking” and cut short his summer holiday to chair meetings on a response. A particularly acute concern for the UK government is the British accent heard from Foley’s masked killer. US intelligence believes hundreds of westerners, including Americans, have joined Isis.

In the UK, Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, launched an investigation into the video as leading linguistics experts said the man sounded like he was from London or the south-east of England.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said of the video: “All the hallmarks point to it being genuine. We’re very concerned by the apparent fact that the murderer in question is British and we are urgently investigating – agencies on both sides of the Atlantic – are first of all looking to authenticate the video, to make sure that it is genuine, and sadly it appears to be, and then to see if we can identify the individual in question.”

A spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel called Foley’s murder barbaric. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said it exposed Isis as the “caliphate of barbarism”. French president Francois Hollande told Le Monde that a global effort “beyond the traditional debate of intervention or non-intervention” was necessary to confront Isis, and proposed an international meeting next month.

With a brutality so severe it prompted al-Qaida to divorce it from the terrorist franchise, Isis has fulfilled a jihadist aspiration to carve out a state. It flies a flag, sets up internal police to govern its subjects’ adherence to its interpretation of Islamic laws and customs, and maintains financial viability through the control of seized oil assets. While other jihadist entities employ terrorist and insurgent tactics, for which infiltration of another’s populace is central, Isis has mustered a highly mobile army that seizes and holds territory.

Foley’s killer emphasized in a propaganda video that Isis is a state, not a terrorist group, a distinction that is fundamental to the group’s prestige. On Wednesday, Obama repeatedly called Isis “terrorists.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists said the murder of Foley, 40, who went missing during a reporting trip to Syria in 2012, “sickens all decent people”.

“Foley went to Syria to show the plight of the Syrian people, to bear witness to their fight, and in so doing to fight for press freedom,” Sandra Mims Rowe, the group’s chair, said in a statement.

In a Facebook message attributed to her, Foley’s mother Diane said: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” She also asked the media and the public to respect her family’s privacy.

Obama hailed Foley, who he called Jim, and said he had called Foley’s parents.

Foley’s murder, Obama said, was “an act of violence that shocks the conscience of the entire world.”"
2068,"Islamic State leaders in Syria and Iraq are training their fighters to fly captured fighter jets in the hope of establishing an air force, it has been claimed.

The terror group are understood to have been carrying out test flights the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, according to a British-based organisation monitoring the Syrian Civil War.

Having captured three fighter jets from the Syrian military, ISIS are using Iraqi pilots who were once officers in Saddam Hussein's air force to train Syria-based militants to operate the warplanes.

The news comes as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula sought to mend its strained relations with ISIS, urging all jihadist groups operating in the Middle East to unite under the common cause of fighting against Western 'crusader' armies.

Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured)

Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces

Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year

ISIS' alleged test flights over the Aleppo countryside are understood to be the first time the terror group - which seized control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq earlier this year - has taken to the air.

'They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for Saddam Hussein,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

'People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,' he said, citing witnesses near al-Jarrah military airport.

The airport, which was seized from the Syrian regime earlier this year, is approximately 45 miles from the Turkish border.

It is not clear if the jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to be Soviet-built MiG 21 or MiG 23 models.

Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured)

Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year

Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying.

The extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said.

As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent.

The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre.

But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days.

They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town.

News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes.

ISIS' alleged test flights come despite American and Arab warplanes carrying out dozens of bombing raids against the group in Syria.

The terrorists have regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and have overrun several military bases but this was the first time it had been able to pilot warplanes.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats.

News of the test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's group.

In a statement released today, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the notorious terror collective's Yemen-based franchise - urged jihadists throughout the Middle East to put their differences aside, according to Charlie Winter, a researcher on jihad at counter-terrorism think-tank Quilliam

The document is understood to have called for Al Qaeda - who are represented in Syria by the Nusra Front and Khorasan terror groups - to stop fighting with ISIS, adding that the militants should instead focus on attacking Western 'crusader' forces and carrying out strikes on American targets.

Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year.

Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year

Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city

Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants

'We urge all Muslims to back their brethren, with their souls, money and tongues, against the crusaders,' the Al Qaeda statement reads.

It also urges Muslims to support 'whoever can weaken the Americans to weaken them militarily, economically, and media-wise.'

Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city.

Sabah Karhout, the chairman of the Anbar provincial council, says the curfew began at midnight this morning as part of an effort to limit movement in and out of the city.

ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants.

Two Iraqi military officials, speaking anonymously because they are not authorized to brief the media, say major operations are underway in Salahuddin province to retake key areas from the Sunni militants around Tikrit and the Beiji oil refinery.

ISIS and allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year.

The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the more than eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Iraq's second city of Mosul and much of the north.

Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups.

Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS.

The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control.

Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS

The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi.

'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,' Shahid said in the recording.

There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group.

Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi."

2072,"Anna Wintour reportedly has a major rat infestation at her Vogue office in New York City.

According to Radar Online, some of the dirtiest rats have decided to move into Anna’s new office for herself and Vogue staffers at the Freedom Tower.

Insiders claim that rodents invaded the beloved accessories closet, leaving an abundance of rat droppings all over their pricey couture, computers, and desks. Further reports claim that the decision to put Kanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue magazine may have something to do with the infestation.

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover. There was so much backlash, and now this!”

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, critics were not very happy with Anna Wintour and the Vogue staff making the “disgusting” decision to place the reality starlet and her husband on the cover. The couple was photographed for the April 2014 cover by Anne Leibovitz.

Vogue and Condé Nast relocated from Times Square to One World Trade Center. However, the rat infestation has not made the Vogue relocation as smooth as they would have liked – especially since reports claim that the rats are only located on the Vogue floors of the building.

“There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into… The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in. Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes…and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Even though Anna Wintour usually allows employees to eat and drink inside of the office, reports claim that a strict policy restricting food and drinks has been issued and enforced until the infestation problem is resolved.

Gawker, the media outlet that initially broke the story, reports that Anna Wintour refuses to even enter her office until it is in pristine condition and completely freed of its rat infestation.

Anna Wintour has made headlines recently by expressing how she felt about the Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover shoot experience. Huffington Post reports that Wintour even hopes that “another Kim Kardashian comes along this year.”

In her own words, Anna Wintour did not feel that the cover photo was “disgusting” at all. On the contrary, she believes that it was touching and charming."
2075,"It's what national security organizations have feared since day one-the World Health Organization (WHO) announced last week that they are evaluating jihadist militants associated with ISIS, who may have contracted the virus responsible for Ebola. While the WHO has yet to confirm whether or not the fighters are exhibiting symptoms, the current evaluations of a Mosul hospital 250 miles north of Baghdad are prompting concerns that the fringe extremist group ISIS may in fact be able to obtain a biological weapon unlike anything the world has seen before.

Like Us on Facebook 

Though Mosul has been under ISIS control since late last June, the Iraqi health ministry has issued a press release denying reports from Iraqi news outlets that claim the soldier are definitively infected and seeking treatment in Mosul.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus"" spokesperson for the health ministry Ahmed Rudaini says. ""They are incapable to detect it.""

Over the past several months, the world has watched as threats from extremist group ISIS have come true, from the beheadings of captured prisoners of war to the mass murder of children's schools. And with the possibility of a global pandemic looming over our heads, many are demanding action be taken to isolate the potential vectors as a worst case scenario. Yet, as conflicting reports abound, international health organizations and the WHO are unable to assess the health concern on site, and treat the patients as their own.

WHO director Christy Feig told reporters early this weekend that "" We [the WHO] have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.""

While that may be true, the possibility that the militants may have contracted the virus causes a problematic situation for the WHO, in that ISIS does not believe in modern medicine and an outbreak in an ISIS-controlled area like Mosul could be a breeding ground for the ever-mutating virus. But worst of all, aside from the possibility of possible infection of Iraq, should ISIS isolate the virus for themselves, the entire western world may find soon enough that the Ebola virus could be the worst weapon known to man.

""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" intelligence analyst for Levantine Group, Benjamin T. Decker says. ""In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul."""
2076,"As a chuckling baby, Jess Smith was one of the most familiar faces on British television in the 1990s.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun – who featured in all 365 programmes – is now 19 and a university student.

At the age of nine months, Jess Smith was selected to be the giggling Baby Sun who looks over Teletubbyland.

The news will come as no surprise to people who have known Jess for a long time, but she said it is not something she really talked about as she was quite a shy child and “everyone knowing would have been a bit scary”.

The former Chatham South and Horsted Primary School pupil made the decision to tell people during her first week at university, when they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, now aged 19
She said: “I thought I may as well tell them as I’m going to be spending the next three years with them.”

Jess, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, then broke the news on Facebook.

She wrote: “So I’ve recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I’ve decided it’s time to tell everyone. I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I’ve gained the confidence to come out with it.

“I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be ‘the sun’ but only I could tell you the real story.”

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess’s name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: “It was just something a bit different to do and we didn’t expect it to be as big as it was.

“They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad. We didn’t hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she’d been picked. It was really weird seeing her on television.”

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

2080,"(CNN) -- A member of the Sugarhill Gang, whose pioneering hit ""Rapper's Delight"" brought hip hop to mainstream audiences 35 years ago, died Tuesday of complications from cancer.
""Big Bank Hank,"" whose real name was Henry Jackson, died early Tuesday in Englewood, New Jersey, according to David Mallie, who manages the two surviving Sugarhill Gang members. The New York native was 57.
A beefy, boisterous presence onstage, Hank handled vocals in the early to middle portion of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which despite its extended length -- one version was more than 14 minutes long -- became the first rap song to reach the Top 40 on the U.S. Billboard charts.
Jackson traded rhymes with bandmates ""Wonder Mike"" Wright and Guy ""Master Gee"" O'Brien and spoke some of the song's catchiest lines, including ""Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn/If your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend.""
Wonder Mike and Master Gee issued a statement Tuesday:
""So sad to hear about our brother's passing. The 3 of us created musical history together with the release of Rapper's Delight. We will always remember traveling the world together and rocking the house. Rest in peace Big Bank.""
The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records.

Released in fall 1979, ""Rapper's Delight"" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit ""Good Times.""
""Rapper's Delight"" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from ""Good Times,"" prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song.

The Washington Post and TIME magazine both posted the video, apparently believing it.

The Post issued a correction, saying that “a bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday. The video appears to have been a hoax.”

TIME wrote: “A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.”

The Associated Press update:

Obama, Putin discuss Ukraine, missile treaty

WASHINGTON (AP) — Capping a week of aggressive action against Russia, President Barack Obama pressed Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday for a diplomatic path out of Ukraine’s struggle with Moscow-backed pro-Russian separatists. Putin countered by calling U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia counterproductive.

Obama later conceded that pressure from recently imposed U.S. and European measures to squeeze the Russian economy “hasn’t resolved the problem yet.”

In an Obama-initiated phone call Friday, the U.S. president also raised concerns that Russia violated a key Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty, the White House said. In a letter this week from Obama to Putin and in an administration report released this week, the United States said Russia violated a 1987 treaty that bans all U.S. and Russian missiles of intermediate range, meaning those that can travel between about 300 miles and about 3,400 miles.

Putin in the call said the sanctions seriously damage bilateral cooperation and general global stability, according to a Kremlin report on the call.

It was the first conversation between the leaders since the U.S. and Europe slapped the new round of economic sanctions on Russia and since Obama’s letter claiming a breach in the missile treaty.

“I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, we’ll also do what we say in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position,” Obama told reporters later.

The Kremlin said both Obama and Putin underscored the urgency for bringing an end to fighting in eastern Ukraine and spoke positively about a meeting that took place the day before in Minsk, Belarus, among members of a diplomatic “contact group” pursuing an end to hostilities. That group includes representatives from Russia, Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe."
2084,"The Force may be with us a little sooner than expected as the latest Star Wars: The Force Awakens buzz seems to indicate that the much-awaited sci-fi's release date may be advanced, presumably amid mounting clamor by impatient fans. While different sources suggest conflicting release dates, they all indicate a much earlier premier than the originally announced December 18.

Rumor has it that director J.J. Abrams is getting fed up with the constant plot and image leaks, The Telegraph said quoting yet other industry sources. Disney has, for its part, started to go after those illegally releasing content from the film, when it asked a judge to subpoena a website that displayed a blurred image of what appeared to be a ""Sith Lord"" last week, the same report stated.
There are apparently very real fears that the story may become public knowledge even before the movie actually hits theaters before yearend. So, advancing the release date may be the director's idea of averting a potentially costly, not to mention embarrassing catastrophe, by mounting a Death Star-level pre-emptive strike on spoilers!
With a quick search of You Tube, fans can watch a one and a half minute ""official trailer"" supposedly released by Disney last November. This particular video clip begins with a helmetless Storm Trooper wandering about what could possibly be the desert of planet Tatooine. However, there could also be dozens of unofficial material floating about the Internet today!
The big question, therefore, is exactly when will the Force Awaken? Speaking at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 recently, director Abrams was quoted as saying that he is pushing for a summer release date for Star Wars Episode 7, according to MoviePilot.
If Abrams and Disney make good on a summer release, this would put the latest Star Wars flick head to head against other much-anticipated films such as Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, Ant Man and Jurassic World, the report added."

“I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings. But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think,” Shen said. “I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.”

Luckily for Shen, the place where she camped out is open for 24 hours. At first, the lovesick woman went unnoticed by employees since they work in different shifts.

""At first no one really noticed her. But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar. Then I realized we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left,” Jiang Li Lung, a KFC employee said.

Shen ordered more wings and fries and continued to stay in her booth. After a week, local media reportedly started flocking to the restaurant so Shen decided it was time to leave.

""I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents. I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving,” Shen said.

But her best line ever?

""And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.""

Ah, the woes of the heartbroken."

Now, there's #HairGate. A 9to5Mac community post reveals that iPhone 6 customers are complaining on social media that their new phones keep ripping out chunks of their hair when they hold the phone up to their ear to take a call.

Twitter users say their hair is getting caught in the seam between the glass screen and aluminum back of the iPhone 6.

My hair keeps getting caught in the microscopic seam between glass and aluminium on my iPhone 6

@9to5Community My iPhone 6+ was pulling my hair too; I returned it, it was underwhelming:(

The seam on my iPhone 6 where the aluminum meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out. #seamgate

Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it during calls. #hurts #beardgate

@EmilyDreyfuss No, its my head hair. I have long hair so it happens when there's a seam on the front of a phone like the iPhone or HTC One.

This news follows #GapGate, which focused on the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Customers complained to Samsung that their new Android phones had a gap between the screen and the case. It's unknown whether Samsung customers are also experiencing hair loss when taking calls on their phones, as some iPhone 6 users are now reporting.

21 amazing Apple Watch apps 

Reports are coming in that Apple is hurrying key app developers in order that there's an impressive selection by 9 March. No wonder if it's aiming for a whopping 100,000 Apple Watch apps at launch.

After attending six Apple WatchKit hackathons, analyst Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research has made the eye-widening estimate that there will be 100,000 available apps to download when we get our hands on the Apple Watch. He estimates that users will download an average of 100 apps in total, versus 65 apps for the iPhone.

2091,"The Department of Homeland Security has received serious and credible information indicating that an extremist splinter group of Al Qaeda, now going by the name Bhakkar Fatwa, is planning multiple attacks against American consumers as they wait in line for stores to open on November 28th: the day known as Black Friday.

Bhakkar Fatwa is a small, relatively unknown group of Islamic militants and fanatics that originated in Bhakkar Pakistan as the central leadership of Al Qaeda disintegrated under the pressures of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and drone strikes conducted around the world. The group has since branched out and begun aggressively recruiting throughout the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Within the last year the group has come under increased scrutiny by both the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security as they have begun actively recruiting on American soil.

Jeh Johnson, Director of the Department of Homeland Security, has referred to Bhakkar Fatwa as the number one growing problem on the domestic terrorism front in America. Their presence is felt in many mosques and islamic centers across the country: always quietly and out of sight, and previously without any violent operations. Officials at both the CIA and Homeland Security think that may be about to change.

Jack Phillips, agent in charge of monitoring Bhakkar Fatwa’s American operation detailed the agencies recent findings. “Working with both the CIA and the NSA we were able to access conversations and communications between members of Bhakkar Fatwa’s domestic organization and their leadership in Pakistan which indicate that several attacks are planned against American citizens at retail operations on the 28th of November”, said Phillips. “The instructions sent from Pakistan detailed a broad plan of attacks using both firearms and homemade explosives against large crowds gathered outside of stores waiting for the sales that have become the hallmark of the day. The leadership of Bhakkar Fatwa views the American religion as one worshiping money and possessions. They commanded these attacks as being against the ‘holiest temples’ that the Americans serve.”

“We have taken several actions based off of this information”, stated Phillips. “We have detained three individuals who were in active communication with Pakistani leadership regarding these planned terror attacks. All three are undergoing interrogation as we speak so that we may hopefully determine the scope and extent of attacks that have been planned. The names of those detained will not be immediately released. They have been deemed enemy combatants and releasing their identities could impact our operational ability at this point. Everything conceivable is being done to unmask and deal with this new threat.”

“If you are going out shopping early on Friday please keep your eyes open”, Phillips advised. ” At this juncture we are unsure as to how great the threat from these attacks is going to be. We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this situations, but this terrorist group is savvy. They utilize a small closed cell structure, and we may not be able to identify all of them in time. I urge all Americans to strongly consider whether the sales are worth the risk. And if you do go out take particular caution while waiting in line for the store to open. Intelligence points to the time spent waiting outside of the store as the time of greatest vulnerability. I am sure we will resolve this issue, but I still recommend taking adequate precautions.”"
2092,"Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week."
2093,A report from Judicial Watch stated that four ISIS members were apprehended at the Mexican border.
2096,"Islamic State militants have released a graphic video allegedly depicting the beheading of American photojournalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing in Syria since 2012.

The Islamist group also threatened to kill another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff of World Affairs and Time, stating his fate is in the hands of President Barack Obama.

Foley went missing almost two years ago while covering the conflict in Syria as a freelance photographer. The 39-year-old reporter was working for Agence France-Presse when he disappeared, and his whereabouts were essentially unknown until this recording surfaced.

His November 22nd disappearance was classified as a kidnapping by the FBI, which stated he “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria.”

In the new video, the militants proclaimed the violent act as “a message to America” for its decision to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, where it has made rapid territorial conquests over the last few months.

After stating that President Obama’s decision to authorize military action against the extremist group “effectively [placed] America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” Foley appears kneeling beside a masked man. He is forced to read a letter which blames the US government for “hammering the final nail into his coffin” before the masked man takes his life.
Sotloff’s life, meanwhile, “depends on Obama’s next decision,” the group claimed. Sotloff has been missing since mid-2013, and his Twitter account indicates his last known location was Libya.

In a statement, the US National Security Council confirmed it had seen the video, but added that it's still working to determine its authenticity.

""If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said.

The video’s release comes just one day after militants declared they would attack American targets “in any place” if American airstrikes kill any of their members. Militants said, “we will drown all of you in blood” and flashed images of an American was beheading during the United States’ initial invasion of Iraq.

So far, the Islamic State’s campaign through Iraq has seen numerous reports of beheadings, including those carried out against child victims. The group has regularly threatened Christians and other minorities to either convert to their radical take on Islam or die, and even forced tens of thousands of ethnic Yazidis to flee to Sinjar Mountain with no food or water in order to escape being executed.

The last event triggered renewed military and humanitarian action by the United States earlier this month, and airstrikes have been used to help Kurdish security forces beat back militant fighters from northern Iraq. On Monday, Obama announced Iraqi and Kurdish forces had retaken control of the Mosul Dam – Iraq’s largest, and a key strategic landmark – marking the most significant victory for Iraqi troops since the US became involved again."
2097,"SEVEN girls, aged 13 to 15, have fallen pregnant after a five-day school trip to their country’s capital city and their parents are being blamed.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls fell pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early engagement in sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynaecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents should, he said, play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”"
2098,"Madrid | The doctors of the Hospital Carlos III confirmed this morning in a press conference, the first human death caused by eating genetically modified food. Juan Pedro Ramos died of anaphylaxis after eating recently developed tomatoes with fish genes, causing a violent and deadly allergic reaction.

This surprising announcement comes after the autopsy of the Spanish man of 31, who died at the hospital in Madrid in early January. The health of the young man quickly deteriorated after suffering an allergic reaction unexplained, and all drugs used to contain anaphylaxis have been totally ineffective. The team of experts claims to have been able to determine that genetically modified tomatoes that the victim ingested at lunch, were the cause of the allergic reaction that caused his death.

Mr. Ramos was working as a secretary in a Madrid warehouse on January 7, and began to feel sick just after lunch. A number of symptoms occurred, including a rash with violent itching, severe swelling of the throat and a drastic drop in blood pressure. The man, who was known to have allergies, quickly injected a degree add'rénaline but his health continued to deteriorate.

The young man was quickly taken to hospital by colleagues, but the medical staff could not identify the cause of the allergic reaction in the time and no treatments or conventional medications seemed to work. Mr. Ramos was pronounced dead a little over an hour after arriving at the hospital.

The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
The young man seemed happy and healthy when this photo was taken by his roommate, less than 24 hours before his death.
Forensic scientists and experts from the hospital Carlos III had to perform a wide battery of tests and analysis before we can accurately determine what caused the death of Mr. Ramos, and this because of an allergic reaction to seafood, because the only things he had swallowed before his death were bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich accompanied by a cocacola light. They were surprised when they discovered that the tomato he had ingested allergens contained not only related to fish, but also some antibiotic resistance genes that had prevented the white blood cells of M. Ramos to save his life.

""At first we thought there had been some form of contamination of food, contact with fish or seafood during the preparation"" , explained Dr. Rafael Pérez-Santamarina. ""It ' is that when we tested the tomato itself, we noticed that it contained certain allergens commonly found in seafood. We did a lot of different analyzes and they all confirmed that the tomato was indeed the source of allergens that killed Mr. Ramos. ""

Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
Several experiments on GMOs produced horrible tumors and even killed rats in laboratories, but most of GM products on the market were considered harmless to humans.
 

Mr. Ramos is the first human death officially confirmed linked to the ingestion of genetically modified foods. It contradicts most studies on GMOs that have concluded that genetically modified current market crops were edible and without dangers.

A team of scientists led by the University of Nebraska had anticipated this problem in 1996, when they found that the protein of a walnut in Brazil, introduced to improve the nutritional quality of GM soy was able to cause an allergic reaction in Brazil. However, this problem has been rejected by most scientists as unlikely as it could easily be avoided with appropriate safety tests. Soybean genes injections in Brazil nuts were effectively abandoned during development, but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused the death of Mr. Ramos was not enough to be tested and risk of death had not been identified before marketing.

The Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, which placed the order of Portuguese origin tomatoes that have infected the young man, demanded that they be repatriated and removed from shops and markets for reasons security. More than 7,000 tons of tomatoes will be seized across the country by ministry inspectors and officials of public safety.

The ministry also made ​​a public announcement about the death of Mr. Ramos in which he offers his condolences to his family and added that ""immediately request further research on the subject, to determine if other food products GM on the European market could represent a risk for the Spanish population.

2104,"KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) -
A man rushed to a Kansas City-area hospital Saturday is not being treated for Ebola, hospital officials say.

HCA Midwest assistant vice president Chris Hamele said that the patient does not have the symptom profile of virus and is being treated appropriately for his condition.

It is unknown at this time what the patient is suffering from or if anyone else is sick.

This comes after a Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard was sealed off about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when the man who lived there became seriously ill.

Paramedics rushed the man to Research Medical Center Brookside Campus about 9:30 p.m. It was then when all or part of the medical facility was quarantined, a source close to the situation told KCTV5 News.

""Like hospitals across the United States, Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions and we are well-equipped and well-prepared to implement them as necessary,"" Hamele said. ""As healthcare providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high-quality care to our community as we always have.""

Kansas City Health Department spokesman Jeff Hershberger said health department officials are monitoring the situation and are in a state of awareness because of the recent lone Ebola patient diagnosed in Texas.

Chris Hernandez, a spokesperson for the city of Kansas City, said they wanted to take an abundance of caution to avoid a Dallas situation and Sunday he's been told that it's considered ""extremely unlikely"" to be Ebola.

Hamele said Sunday that the patient has been responding well to treatment that day and was upgraded to good condition."

The formidable magazine supremo looked in no mood to mess with as she left Conde Nast's offices on the 25th and 26th floor of the skyscraper.

According to the New York Daily News, the swish new office building is infested with vermin and staff are understandably horrified.

'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,' a source told the paper.

2109,"A SCHOOLBOY who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a massive electrical shock claims he now has superpowers like those of Marvel’s Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, from Russia, had been walking home from school when he lent briefly against a lamppost that was electrified from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

“When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened.

“When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body,” he said.

“Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.”

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, decided to put it to the test.

“I can do things I couldn’t do before but I don’t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

“Once I even attracted a glass — it just moved towards me.”

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of being a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai’s classmate, Vika Balandina, said: “I could even hang a ladle on my nose.”

Stories about “living magnets” began to appear in the middle of the 19th century.

A group of 12 diners joined Smith at the steakhouse, the brainchild of legendary chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

During an earnings call Tuesday, MGM Resorts International revealed that an unnamed guest had dropped $300,000 on a meal at Prime during the week of CES. On Wednesday, an anonymous source confirmed to Bloomberg that the big spender was indeed Smith.

The Vice CEO had apparently had quite the night at the blackjack tables — according to the Bloomberg report, he had won some $100,000 gambling earlier that night.

MGM spokesman Clark Dumont told Bloomberg that the majority of the check was spent on wine, with some bottles costing more than $20,000 each.

Smith did not immediately return a request for comment.

2114,"(DETROIT) In a decision that’s expected to send shockwaves through the African-American community—and yet, give much relief to teachers everywhere—a federal judge ruled today that black women no longer have independent naming rights for their children. Too many black children—and many adults—bear names that border on not even being words, he said.

“I am simply tired of these ridiculous names black women are giving their children,” said U.S. Federal Judge Ryan Cabrera before rendering his decision. “Someone had to put a stop to it.”

The rule applies to all black women, but Cabrera singled out impoverished mothers.

“They are the worst perpetrators,” he said. “They put in apostrophes where none are needed. They think a ‘Q’ is a must. There was a time when Shaniqua and Tawanda were names you dreaded. Now, if you’re a black girl, you hope you get a name as sensible as one of those.”

Few stepped forward to defend black women—and black women themselves seemed relieved.

“It’s so hard to keep coming up with something unique,” said Uneeqqi Jenkins, 22, an African-American mother of seven who survives on public assistance. Her children are named Daryl, Q’Antity, Uhlleejsha, Cray-Ig, Fellisittee, Tay’Sh’awn and Day’Shawndra.

Beginning in one week, at least three white people must agree with the name before a black mother can name her child.

“Hopefully we can see a lot more black children with sensible names like Jake and Connor,” Cabrera said.

His ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by a 13-year-old girl whose mother created her name using Incan hieroglyphics.

“She said it would make me stand out,” said the girl, whose name can’t be reproduced by The Peoples News’ technology. “But it’s really just stupid.”

The National Association of Elementary School Teachers celebrated Cabrera’s decision.

“Oh my God, the first day of school you’d be standing there sweating, looking at the list of names wondering ‘How do I pronounce Q’J’Q’Sha.’?” said Joyce Harmon, NAEST spokeswoman. “Is this even English?”

The practice of giving black children outlandish names began in the 1960s, when blacks were getting in touch with their African roots, said historian Corlione Vest. But even he admits it got out of hand.

“I have a niece who’s six. I’m embarrassed to say I can’t even pronounce her name,” said Vest, a professor at Princeton University. “Whenever I want to talk to her, I just wait until she looks at me and then I wave her over.”

Cabrera’s ruling exempted black men because so few of them are actually involved in their children’s lives.

Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon when locals in the city of Ganganagar in India’s north-western Rajasthan state heard a girl’s screams.

A mob dragged Kumar away after he was found in an alley allegedly pinning his victim to a wall – and then the group held a vigilante community meeting to decide what to do with him.

He was beaten with sticks for an hour, and dragged into a local butcher’s shop where his organ was severed with a meat cleaver.

It was thrown into the street.

2116,"Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.

The site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan’s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn’t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.

Amazon’s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.

Opening a physical location is “about marketing the Amazon brand,” said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. “Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.”

Amazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Operating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company’s already thin profit margins.

Some details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon’s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.

If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company’s thinking.

Amazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon’s growing power in retailing.

The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach’s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.

The Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy’s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.

“Foot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,” said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.

The streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.

Vornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. “As a former department store, it’s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that’s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants” favor, he said.

Ordering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy’s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.

Amazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.

Amazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don’t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.

Amazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.’s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon’s thinking. By year’s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.

Other primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.

New York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.

Mr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers."

2123,"The man known as Jihadi John. Photo: Reuters

The world knows him as ""Jihadi John,"" the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolise.

""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"" said one of Emwazi's close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post.

American journalist James Foley in Syria in July, 2012. Photo: AP

""He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.""

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

""There was an extremely strong resemblance,"" Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. ""This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John.

James Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September — only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley — that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley's killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ""Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues."" ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

US officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi's family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends — a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib — never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It's unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain's domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. ""Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,"" Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalise his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again — this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

""I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,"" he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now ""I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.""

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had ""heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!""

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

""This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,"" Qureshi said. In the end, he felt ""actions were taken to criminalise him and he had no way to do something against these actions.""

Close friends of Emwazi's also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It's unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

""He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,"" one of the friends said. ""He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.""

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It's unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility ""the box."" Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ""George."" A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. ""He was the most deliberate,"" a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

""I was wondering if you could send me your number,"" he wrote. ""Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.""

There was no response.

2125,"On December 17, a site called InSerbia.info published a 400-word piece under the sensational headline:

BiH: Seven Primary School Students Pregnant After Five-Day Excursion


“BiH” presumably refers to — according to the article — the ministry run by Serbia’s National Coordinator for Reproductive Health, Nenad Babici. Babici is the only source the article uses for the story.

The original article has now been linked by the New York Post,  the London Daily Mail, the New York Daily News, Australia’s Courier Mail, Newser, Cosmopolitan UK, and several others. None have performed any follow-up to confirm the original reporting. One newspaper though, added details to the story that were never reported.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s start with the underlying original story.

Even in Bosnia, such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and ne’er-do-wells jumping in front of a camera, and copious b-roll of the school’s front entrance. None of this is present. The only source referenced at all in the story is Babici and his claim that it happened. But notably, he is not quoted as saying it happened — he is paraphrased. The remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him, but the quote doesn’t refer to the incident. It instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry, which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences, and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school:

National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska Nenad Babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14 and added that primary school students from a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina went to a five-day trip, and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it.

He said that the reason for this was neglect of parents, but also educational institutions, toward the education of children.

Babic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

“In the Republika Srpska between 15 to 18 percent of people are struggling with infertility, we have 15 percent of miscarriages and between 5 to 10 percent premature births,” he said.

Only last year, according to the Clinical Center of the University in Sarajevo, 31 minors gave birth, four of them are 15 years old, ten are 16 years old and 17 are 17 years old.

Look at that last paragraph: if a city the size of Sarajevo only recorded 31 instances of teenage births last year, then Sarajevo doesn’t have a teen pregnancy problem, unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric.

Meanwhile, this story claims the girls were visiting Sarajevo from “a small town in Bosnia and Herzegovina” called Banja Luka. It is not at all clear as to what population that “31 minors” is drawn from.

Beyond the shortcomings of the article itself, how likely is the story’s claim?

Statistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons; this study referenced in this BBC article puts the figure at about 5 percent, except for the short window prior to ovulation, during which the study estimates the odds at 25 percent. So either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each, or they each had closer to 20 encounters over the five days.

Or all 28 students were active and about to ovulate. Either/or.

Every scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable, from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage. To a link-seeking media searching for a scoop, this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article, or to stay clear. So how did our brethren respond?

At the start of the post, I mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers, magazines and Websites as the New York Post, the London Daily Mail, the New York Daily News, the Australian Courier Mail, Newser, Cosmopolitan UK. And — perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch — the Daily Mail added details to the story that were never reported."
2127,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City health officials said a man held in isolation at a local hospital over the weekend was not infected with the Ebola virus. Officials hope to sooth nerves as fears about the deadly virus spread across the country, even though the virus itself has not.

“We have ruled out any Ebola case in Kansas City,” Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer told reporters on Monday. He said the man, who had recently traveled to Nigeria, did not possess the symptom profile for the deadly virus beyond a high fever and had not been in direct contact with anyone who had the disease during his travels.

No Ebola blood test was done, Dr. Archer said, because the feared symptoms never materialized.

The case marked the second known Ebola scare in the Kansas City area , as fears of the virus have built while an American fights for his life against it in Dallas.

At the White House Monday, President Barack Obama urged calm and outlined several steps the administration is taking to contain the virus in Africa and fight it there.

“The CDC is familiar with dealing with infectious diseases and viruses like this,” the president said. “We know what has to be done, and we have the medical infrastructure to do it.”

Monday morning, Kansas Senator Jerry Moran sent a letter to the CDC director , urging greater screening at U.S. ports of entry, including airports.

This afternoon, President Obama said such steps are under consideration.

“We're also going to be looking at protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States,” Obama said. “All of these things make me confident that here in the United States, the chances of an outbreak-of an epidemic here- are extraordinarily low.”"
2129,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the MQ-1 Reaper.

The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.

According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems.

The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) — of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give U.S. policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.

As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses.

The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base in Turkey. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.

A second possibility could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of U.S. drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

A regional security expert also reports that Predator drones were seen operating in the civilian airport near Erbil.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vice founder Shane Smith recently balled out exceptionally hard on a dinner for a group of 12 at the Prime Steakhouse in Las Vegas, racking up a $300,000 check.

A source at Vice told BuzzFeed News that Smith won a sum “well north of that bill” while gambling during his week at the CES conference in Las Vegas, and paid for the dinner on his personal credit card. (A Financial Times report says Smith won $1 million; both the FT and New York Times say there were about 30 people eating on Smith’s dime.)

Smith himself hasn’t commented on the story, which is a pity, because the world needs to know the answer to a crucial question: How can you spend $300,000 on dinner?

Short of a how-to guide from the man himself, or a member of his $2.5 billion digital media empire, we’re left to speculate. So in that spirit, we checked out the menu at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino.

Prime’s Siberian Sturgeon Caviar with traditional accompaniments was likely a must for Smith’s group. The restaurant lists the item as market price, but Eater Las Vegas has it going for up to $2,500 per pound. A couple pounds of caviar seems reasonable.

ALLEKO/ALLEKO

Mercifully for Smith, Prime doesn’t put its wine list online. But just down the strip at Mario Batali’s Carnevino in the Wynn, a few bottles of Dom Perignon (2003) will run guests $400 each.

Jay L. Clendenin/Los Angeles Times / MCT

But what are we, farmers? Any respectable internet baron is going to spring for a couple of bottles of the best champagne in the house. At Batali’s joint, a 1.5-liter bottle of Boërl & Kroff 1998 will set you back $15,000 each.

AntonMatveev/AntonMatveev

Obviously white wine accompanies any good foodie’s fish course. Smith’s crew could have grabbed a couple bottles of the $9,000 Montrachet, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti from 2007. An average year, but sometimes compromise is necessary.

Manakin/Manakin

For the reds, perhaps a couple of vintages on the more reasonable side, like the $5,000 per bottle Sine Qua Non “Just for the Love of It” 2002 Syrah.

2132,"The video was one of those viral sensations that tugs on your heartstrings and compels you to watch, because it defies your expectations and shows you just how kind and compassionate human beings can be. There was only one problem.

The video was a fake — at least according to a witness who says he was there while the YouTube hit, “How Does A Homeless Man Spend $100?” was filmed.

You have probably seen the video by now — if not, view it above. Posted by the prolific prankster Josh Paler Lin — whose other videos include “Sex In The Bathroom Prank” and “Rock Paper Scissors Hickey!” — the viral video purported to be a “social experiment” in which Paler Lin gave a homeless man identified as “Thomas” a hundred bucks in cash, then “secretly” filmed him as he spent the money.

The video was picked up by dozens of media outlets, including the Inquisitr, and in the week the clip has been on YouTube, has racked up more than 28 million views.

Why? Because Thomas spent his money not on booze or drugs, but on food. And not just for himself. He used the cash to purchase and distribute food to his fellow homeless people in Orange County, California.

While determining how much revenue any particular YouTube video creates is difficult, by many estimates a video can earn between $1,000 and $5,000 for each million views it accumulates.

That means Paler Lin may have grossed anywhere from $28,000 to $140,000 off this single video — in one week.

Perhaps more important, Paler Lin created a crowdfunding campaign along with the video, to raise more money for Thomas. That campaign has so far brought in about $130,000 in donations from people moved by the selfless acts Thomas performs in the video.

But in an interview posted on the site Vocativ on Tuesday, Taugan Tan Kadalim, who says he stumbled by chance across Paler Lin filming the video and witnessed the whole thing, calls the entire scenario “bull****.”

Kadalim, 26, says that he was there at Euclid Liquor & Market where he had just purchased a lottery ticket before walking across the street to his girlfriend’s apartment, and that what he saw made it clear that “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

Kadalim says he is a fan of Paler Lin and recognized the YouTube celebrity immediately.

He then watched as Paler Lin entered the liquor store and spoke with a clerk as Thomas waited outside. Only after Paler Lin returned, Kadalim told Vocativ, did Thomas enter the liquor store.

“He drove Thomas to the liquor store,” Kadalim told the site. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Vocativ said its reporters corroborated the story with Kadalim’s girlfriend and brother, but calls to the liquor store went unreturned. Kadalim posted a comment to the video’s YouTube page the day the video went on line, saying quote clearly that Paler Lin drove Thomas to the store, but the comment went largely ignored.

Paler Lin, however, adamantly denied faking any part of the “homeless” viral video, telling Vocativ, “There is no way we’re making any of this up. This is real.”"
2133,"There have been lots of “Comcast delivers bad customer service” stories lately — so overwhelming, in fact, that the company just appointed an executive to solve the problem amid worries that disgruntled customers could derail the company’s merger with Time Warner — but the latest story may be the worst: A Comcast customer says the company got him fired from the job.


Consumerist reports that the customer — known in the story only as ""Conal"" — began subscribing to Comcast in 2013 under a promotional offer, but almost immediately found himself charged for set-top boxes that had not been activated. He says he met with a Comcast rep in May of that year to sort out the billing issues, but they actually got worse from there.

He attempted to cancel, but was persuaded to stay for three free months of The Movie Channel; the company ended up sending him items he hadn't order and charged him more than $1,800 for them. Conal, an accountant, then contacted Comcast's controller. Consumerist reports: ""During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation.""

Here's where the problem develops: Comcast learned where Conal was employed. It just happened to be a company that does business with Comcast.

Consumerist reports that Conal claims he never named the company when he was on the phone with various customer service reps — he believes Comcast must've looked up the information somehow. Nonetheless:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Emphasis added.

Consumerist, never a Comcast-friendly publication to begin with, seethes:

""I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office,"" writer Chris Moran says. ""Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.  And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.""

Comcast told Consumerist it ""will review (Conal's) lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”"
2134,"An official of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), who has been on furlough for the past 25 years, has been dismissed from service. On Thursday, Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu issued orders to dismiss A.K. Verma for unauthorised absence from duty.

Mr. Verma, who joined the CPWD as an assistant executive engineer in 1980, went on leave in December 1990 and did not report to work thereafter. According to the Ministry, he continued extending his leave and defied directions to report to work.

An inquiry was instituted against him in September 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty. “Owing to non-cooperation of Mr. Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005,” the Ministry said."

On Friday, bleedingcool.com said, ""The scuttlebutt from sources in Detroit is that one of the Batmobile models being used in the filming of Batman Vs. Superman has gone missing, believed stolen.""

Not surprisingly, the Internet went into a tizzy, but later that day, Detroit police said the theft was a rumour.

Sgt. Michael Woody told the Detroit Free Press that police confirmed with producers of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice that the vehicle has not been stolen.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

The paper also said that sources close to the movie being filmed in D-Town also said the fly ride had not been stolen.

2137,"The following is one of the most unusual media stories of the last year.

On Friday, Esquire Magazine posted a blistering piece bashing ESPN written by the publication’s news editor Ben Collins.  It was entitled “ESPN has a problem with women.”

While the column centered on the suspensions of Bill Simmons and Stephen A. Smith, the lead produced some exclusive details about coverage plans for Monday Night Football.  Namely, the network would be having a domestic violence panel featuring 11 different voices.  All men.  Our bold emphasis has been added.

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.
The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

How Collins got that information, whether through his own sources or ESPN itself, was never shared with Esquire readers.  Nevertheless, the “11 men” theme kept coming back throughout his piece as a tentpole of outrage.

The existence of ESPN’s 11 men domestic violence panel, and the anger towards it, spread slowly throughout the weekend.  Deadspin has a nice recap of how far the story reached as it was noticed on Twitter and reblogged across the internet, with one feminist organization even putting the network on blast based on the Esquire article in a press release.

Of course, ESPN is not having an 11 man domestic violence panel tonight.  The network has explicitly and publicly called the Esquire story false as documented below.

But just examining this story from the outset, there was plenty to be skeptical about in Esquire’s story.

First of all, ESPN has covered domestic violence and the NFL at length while involving women in the discussion.  Jane McManus has been a consistent presence on ESPN airwaves and ESPN has a deep bench of female commentators that have talked about the issue on the air.  You can criticize sports networks for not involving women in more prominent ways, but ESPN at least appears to be trying to make an effort here.  McManus defended the network on Twitter:



Second, in light of those tweets, there’s no mention of Suzy Kolber – who will be one of the hosts on Monday Night Countdown tonight.  If there’s any panel discussion happening tonight, wouldn’t she be involved?

Third, it’s easy to make fun of ESPN and the gratuitously absurd amount of NFL analysts the network employs.  But who in their right mind would conduct an 11 person panel on a topic like domestic violence?  That’s not something that even Nancy Grace and the cable news networks would be silly enough to do.

If we’re to believe this Esquire story, Chris Berman would be moderating an 11 person panel discussion on domestic violence including everyone from the game announcers to reporters.  It’s nonsensical.  Not even ESPN would be that dense.

Bristol began the counter-offensive today.  The network released their coverage plans for Monday Night Countdown tonight.  And in a move straight out of the ESPN PR Playbook, they also highlighted women’s contributions to their coverage of the NFL domestic violence crisis.

A rare public statement from John Wildhack, one of the highest on the ESPN Executive Food Chain, also disputed the Esquire report/column/rant/guesswork…

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown.  We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting.  ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage.  Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms,  including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more. 

So how did this happen?  It’s simple.  Haphazard and reckless writing at Esquire gradually began to be taken as fact.

There never were plans for an 11 men panel to discuss domestic violence on Monday Night Countdown.  Collins merely listed the talent that would be working the show and assumed the topic would come up at some point during the evening in an unbelievable failure in communication through the written word.

Collins explained his position in greater detail on his Twitter page:


That’s a pretty far cry from what Collins actually wrote in his article which made it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football team. “Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN.”  There’s no ambiguity in that statement.

100 out of 100 people would read that sentence and think ESPN would be televising a large all-male panel discussion specifically focused on domestic violence tonight.  How does someone who is a news editor at a major publication blur the lines of truth and fiction so badly?




Had Collins stuck with that last tweet he would have had the basis for a decent column and a valid criticism worth raising.  But because of the overall sloppiness of the Esquire piece, that point was missed entirely.  Instead, a lot of people have wasted a lot of time talking about an 11 men domestic violence panel that never existed."
2138,"The Islamic State (Isis) operating in Iraq does not have Ebola, the World Health Organization has confirmed.

Last week a number of reports emerged suggesting members of the terrorist organisation had contracted the disease.

The Daily Mail reported that three media outlets had said a number of militants had shown signs of the deadly virus in the city of Mosul.

Speaking to Mashable, a WHO spokesperson said they were investigating the reports. ""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications, told the website.

The organisation has now confirmed there are no suspected cases of Ebola in Iraq as of 5 January.

""On 31 December, 2014, Al-Sabah newspaper, Shafaq news agency and Rudaw online newspaper reported a rumour of EVD cases in Mosul, Ninewa governorate,"" WHO said in a statement. ""The news was also relayed through other media agencies in and outside of Iraq.

""Following this rumour, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization investigated the allegations through existing surveillance networks, as well as through contacts with health authorities and medical sources in Ibn Sina Hospital in Mosul.

""All sources contacted have negated the existence of any suspected cases of Ebola. The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus.""

It said both the Ministry of Health and WHO has scaled up surveillance efforts to ensure early detection of any suspected Ebola cases, and that all precautionary measures are being taken to prevent the disease from entering Iraq.

""The surveillance efforts have been scaled up at all health facilities to ensure that any imported or suspected cases are promptly detected.

""A contingency and response plan is currently under development.""

2139,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria’s Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the government and said more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls all have converted to Islam and been married off.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

“The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,” he said, laughing.

“In this war, there is no going back,” he said in the video received by The Associated Press in the same way as previous messages.

Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the IS group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists’ version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram’s kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria’s government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first couple of days, but 219 remain missing.

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau’s announcement further discredits the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015 in Africa’s most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan’s failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People’s Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election."
2141,"Sons of Anarchy won’t get made into a movie. A hoax article saying that creator Kurt Sutter will launch a film with Charlie Hunnam and Brad Pitt has gone viral.

The bogus piece was published on Empire News, a satirical news website.

Here’s the disclaimer for the site: “Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental.”

It had more than 80,000 shares as of Wednesday.

A number of people apparently believed the fake article.

“And Brad Pitt is a bad choice to play John Teller anyway , I’d Choose Sam Elliot,” one person wrote in the comments section.

Added another: “Hope this is fake. Not sure I like Brad Pitt as John Teller. I don’t want to look at the screen and feel it’s another Hollywood movie. Should get lost in the story just like on TV and may not happen when seeing Brad Pitt. Should get a little known actor for the role to create the character rather than buy one.”

Here’s what the original article said:

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt."
2142,"Gillian Rosenberg, the Canadian-Israeli woman fighting ISIS with Kurdish forces in Syria, has updated her Facebook page to say that, contrary to reports, she has not been captured by militant forces.

“Guys, I’m totally safe and secure,” she wrote Monday. “I don’t have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security. I can’t reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these buklshit [sik] news stories. Ignore the reports that I’ve been captured.”

News of Rosenberg’s apparent capture first emerged online on ISIS-affiliated websites early Sunday morning. The websites did not post any proof or state whether she was in Iraq or Syria, The Jerusalem Post reported, only saying that she had been taken hostage following three suicide attacks on Kurdish forces.

The Canadian and Israeli governments said Sunday that they were looking into reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman had been captured by ISIS in Syria. They have not yet confirmed the news posted on Rosenberg’s page.

Rosenberg is believed to be the first foreign female fighter to join Syrian Kurds in their fight against ISIS.

In an interview with Israel Radio earlier this month, Rosenberg claimed to be in Iraq and said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas and planned to battle militants in Syria. When asked about her decision to fight, she said, “[The Kurds] are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.”

Rosenberg left Canada and moved to Israel in 2006 and served for two years in the Israeli Defense Forces.

In 2009, she was arrested and extradited to the United States for her involvement “in a phony ‘lottery prize’ scheme that targeted victims, mostly elderly.” She served three years in jail for fraud.

Rosenberg said she communicated with Kurdish fighters online before deciding to join them. According to her Facebook page, she arrived in Iraq on Nov. 2.

Rosenberg recently wrote about her eagerness to join the Kurdish forces on her Facebook page.

She also posted pictures of herself, seemingly in Iraq and Syria.

On Nov. 20, Rosenberg said that she would not have access to the internet for two weeks and that someone else would be managing her account.

Photos of Rosenberg brandishing a weapon and stepping on an ISIS flag appeared on LiveLeak on Nov. 22.

Death Hoax

In a report published by Unam Noticias, we read that Millan died in a Santa Clarita hospital of a heart attack. The story states that Millan’s death was announced by his wife at a press conference. The article, as of this writing, has received nearly 20,000 shares online.

The report, however, is not true.

cesar millan

Some shocked readers shared the sad news on social media, without first verifying the claims in the report. Although as of this writing, neither Millan nor his representatives have responded to the death hoax, there are several factors which indicate the article is not true.

Consider:

The original report does not cite any sources.
No legitimate media outlets have reported Millan’s death
There is no evidence that Millan’s wife held a press conference
There has been no such announcement on Millan’s official Facebook page.
The story on Unam Noticias is rife with grammatical and spelling errors (example: “Millan was hospitalize yesterday afternoon, the medical reports indicate that he suffered a fulminate heart attack, which paralyze his heart unavailable for the blood…”
Bottom Line

The report claiming that Cesar Millan died of a heart attack appears to be yet another celebrity death hoax. The poorly-written source of this report offered no sources and has received no corroboration from trusted media outlets or representatives of Millan."

2145,"A Texas plumber says he has no idea how his company's work truck ended up in the hands of Islamic extremists in Syria.

The truck, a black Ford F-250 with the logo for Texas City's Mark-1 Plumbing emblazoned on the door, appeared in a tweet posted Monday by the Ansar al-Deen Front, a jihadist group operating near Aleppo. In the photo, a man fires an anti-aircraft gun mounted to the bed of the truck, presumably where plumbing equipment used to sit.

— Caleb Weiss (@Weissenberg7) December 15, 2014

Jeff Oberholtzer, the son of the owner of Mark-1 Plumbing, told the Texas outlet The Galveston Daily News that the company sold the truck to AutoNation in October 2013, believing the auto retailer would remove the plumbing decals -- a step Oberholtzer normally does himself, but didn't do this time. He says he has no idea how the vehicle ended up in Syria.

Reached for comment by The Huffington Post on Wednesday, an AutoNation spokesman denied any direct involvement with the truck's odd destination. He said the company sent the truck to be sold at auction, and that it traded hands repeatedly before apparently ending up in Syria.

""AutoNation took the truck in a trade-in, we immediately sent it to an auction house, the auction house then took the title and sold it to a local used car dealer,"" he said, distancing AutoNation from the scenario. ""AutoNation was nothing but the pass-through for this vehicle.”

Oberholtzer told media that Mark-1 has received more than a thousand calls and faxes, some of them threatening, since the Ansar al-Deen Front's tweet circulated Monday.

""We have nothing to do with terror at all,"" Oberholtzer told Texas news source KHOU. ""To think something we would use to pull trailers, now is being used for terror, it's crazy. Never in my lifetime would think something like that."""

2149,"Newly released audio allegedly records the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown

At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire

Experts have said this indicated a 'moment of contemplation' for Wilson

FBI has confirmed it has interviewed the man who recorded audio

Officer Wilson claims he felt his life was threatened on August 9

Witnesses and a friend of Brown, 18, claim he had surrendered

Brown was buried on Monday in a ceremony attended by thousands

The FBI has been handed a potentially crucial recording that allegedly contains audio of the moment that Officer Darren Wilson opened fire and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.

Revealed by CNN's Don Lemon on Monday, at least ten shots are heard to ring out during the background of the recording, with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

The unidentified man who has given the unverified tape to authorities claims to have coincidentally recorded the fatal shots that killed Brown in broad daylight on August 9, and experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

Scroll Down for Audio

Attorney: Lopa Blumenthal is legally representing the man who claims to have coincidentally recorded the shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy US Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots can be heard to cackle in the background — seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

Lemon cautioned that 'CNN cannot independent verify the authenticity of this tape' but did say that the FBI have interviewed both Blumenthal and her client.

'We had been told that at least six shots were fired at Michael Brown. In the tape that you have, which is alleged to be of the shooting—we can't independently authorize it, as CNN, because we did not shoot it, but there were more than six shots,' Lemon said.

Nightly scenes of unrest have erupted in Ferguson since Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, more than two weeks ago

Officer Darren Wilson (right, collecting a commendation) has claimed that a confrontation sparked by a scuffle with Michael Brown led to the Ferguson teens fatal shooting on August 9 (left, Wilson paces around the body of Brown in the aftermath of the shooting) while witnesses claim the officer continued to shoot at an unarmed man with his hands up who had surrendered

Grief: Dorian Johnson, who is one of the key witnesses in the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, leaves Brown's funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on Monday, 25, August

If indeed the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on that Saturday afternoon.

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling opening his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleges that Wilson continued to fire.

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that the officer had suffered an 'orbital blowout fracture'.

But CNN reported on Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

A police source told Fox: 'The Assistant (Police) Chief took him to the hospital, his face all swollen on one side. He was beaten very severely.'

Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last Thursday night

The source continued: 'They ignored him [Wilson] and the officer started to get out of the car to tell them to move. They shoved him right back in, that’s when Michael Brown leans in and starts beating Officer Wilson in the head and the face.'

A police source has confirmed to MailOnline that Wilson was taken to hospital and treated for facial injuries sustained during the Brown incident but would not elaborate on the severity or nature of those injuries.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Earlier reports had claimed that Officer Wilson was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has come under fire after calling for the 'vigorous prosecution' of Wilson despite the fact that the officer has not yet been charged with any crime.

His deputy, Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder said: 'It's really heartbreaking to see a man elected to an office that high in our state government... come out with a statement like that, that does prejudge the case.'

St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch said on Wednesday he estimated it would be the middle of October before the grand jury reached a decision on whether Officer Wilson will face charges over Michael Brown's death.

Gov. Jay Nixon on Thursday ordered the Missouri National Guard to begin withdrawing from Ferguson.

Since the guard's arrival Monday, flare-ups in the small section of town that had been the center of nightly unrest have begun to subside.

About 100 people gathered Thursday evening, walking in laps near the spot where Michael Brown was shot. Some were in organized groups, such as clergy members.

More signs reflected calls by protesters to remove the prosecutor from the case."

In case you're having deja vu, the WSJ reported exactly the same thing back in March and Amazon firmly denied it. However, the Post confidently said that the offering is now a definite ""go."" One of its sources for the rumor is a potential advertiser, which said Amazon would unveil the service in order to increase its video share against arch-rival Netflix -- and ultimately tempt users into Prime memberships.

Amazon (sort of) offers limited ad-supported streaming now, by letting non-Prime users watch a limited selection of Prime shows with commercial breaks. If the Post's report proves accurate, the launch of a larger ad-supported streaming service may mean that the current version successfully enticed Amazon customers to buy Prime. Amazon recently scored a deal to stream classic HBO programs like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in a minor coup over Netflix. But it still has less than a tenth of its competitor's size -- and we imagine that ""free"" looks pretty good to a lot of users, ads or not.

2153,"North Korean leader, who has been missing for weeks from the public eye, is recuperating from surgery, according to a report. Kim had been on tour of military bases and factories wearing Cuban heels.

North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un has been missing from public view because he’s recuperating from surgery to repair two broken ankles, a new report says.

The North Korean leader, who has gained weight since assuming leadership of the repressive, eccentric country, had been seen limping in official state videos before disappearing from view in early September.

Kim ended up in the hospital because he put off getting treatment for his injuries, The Chosun Ilbo reported.

The reclusive Kim was operated on at the Bonghwa Clinic, a prestigious medical center for elite party members, the report said.

Speculation has arisen that Kim’s rapid weight gain since assuming leadership after his father,Kim Jong Il, died in 2011, has caused the young ruler to develop gout.

He is also rumored to be a heavy drinker.

His broken ankles were possibly the result of walking in high-heeled boots made in Cuba, during extensive tours of military installations and factories, the report said.

2154,"Experts do not know whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or shot into the ground

Kashmira Gander writes for the Independent and Independent on Sunday

Monday 08 September 2014

Experts from across the world are attempting to understand whether a mysterious bang heard in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday night was caused by a meteorite which broke off from a passing asteroid.

Baffled residents of the Central American city told reporters that they heard a loud boom at around 11pm, but did not see anything shoot across the sky. Meanwhile, scientists are uncertain whether the now missing rock disintegrated or shot deep into the ground.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told reporters.

Jose Millan, from the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), said residents of the capital had made a lucky escape as no one was injured.

""We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population,"" he said.

A committee formed to investigate the incident have confirmed that the noise was caused by a “relatively small” meteorite that fell from an asteroid passing close to Earth, said Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo.

She added that international experts have been called upon to help local scientists understand the situation and its possible links to the ""Pitbull"" asteroid.

Meanwhile, Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the institute of territorial studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light.""

""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something,"" he said.

A Nicaraguan soldier checking the crater  The meteorite left a crater with a radius 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet near Managua's international airport and an air force base, said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan institute of territorial studies who took part in the investigation.

It is yet unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated on impact or became buried, he added.

Humberto Garcia, of the astronomy centre at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to Pitbull.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Two Nicaraguan soldiers guard the crater  Meanwhile, British scientist Dr Dan Brown said he agreed that the crater may be linked to the Pitbull, or 2014 RC, asteroid, but said this was not the only solution.

The astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there,"" he suggested.

Echoing the confusion of Nicaraguan residents and experts, he continued: ""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom - but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that.

""Further analysis will hopefully help to establish this and possibly give a better indication of the object's trajectory. It is still to be seen if any material of the meteorite can be recovered.

""Both pieces of evidence would make it possible to link it to 2014 RC and help us understand more about asteroids,"" he said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, interior minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday. He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi’s child.
“Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,” he said.
“Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,” Mr Mashnuq added.
“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Mr Mashnuq said."

One of the five Taliban fighters traded last year for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is trying to make contact with the Taliban once again, Fox News has learned.

A U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that the former Guantanamo prisoner has been intercepted making telephone calls to the Taliban.

The development comes amid rising concerns over former Guantanamo detainees returning to the battlefield, and over the nature of the Bergdahl-Taliban trade itself last year, which was negotiated with the involvement of the Qatari government.

Despite the apparent outreach by one of the traded prisoners, all five of the so-called “Taliban 5” are still accounted for in Qatar, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.

""There are no indications that they are a risk right now,” another defense official said.

In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said, ""first of all, we take all allegations of re-engagement very seriously. There are different ways of considering re-engagement. It doesn’t necessarily mean return to the battlefield, we take it all seriously.

""We have a good security partnership with the government of Qatar, they have provided assurances and I can tell you, we are comfortable at the Defense Department that we can mitigate any threat that could be posed by anyone of the individuals in terms of terrorist activity.""

CNN first reported that one of the former detainees has tried to return to militant activity. According to CNN, this has touched off a debate in the Obama administration about whether this individual, who was not identified, and even the other four pose a new threat.

The development is already reverberating on Capitol Hill.

""If President Obama continues to release these dangerous terrorists, there will be a steep price to pay – very likely in lost American lives,"" said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.

“I am extremely disturbed by a report that one of the Taliban 5 is suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activities,” Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who wants to suspend the transfer of high-risk detainees out of Guantanamo Bay, said in a statement Thursday. “This report highlights the danger of the administration’s irresponsible decision to transfer the Taliban 5, and underscores yet again the serious risks posed by the misguided effort to empty Guantanamo in order to close it.”

Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, while not able to confirm the report, said it was ""almost inevitable"" that a freed Taliban fighter would return to terrorism.

""Has a terrorist released at (President Obama's) direction returned to militant activity? If so, will he take action to detain this individual as he should have continued to do?"" Thornberry told Fox News. ""In cases like this, the president should not hide behind the convenience of classified information to shield himself from what is reportedly a very serious concern.""

Asked for comment, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said he would not address specific cases.

“However,” he said, “we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary.

2161,"Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy

A fisherman has reeled in a monster 19 stone catfish, which could be the biggest in the world caught with a rod and reel.

Dino Ferrari hooked the whopper wels catfish, which was 2.67m in length, last week in the Po Delta in Italy.

While the fish might set a new record for the biggest caught on a line, it is far from the heaviest ever landed. The biggest was 22st and 2.78m long, and was also from the Po Delta.

Wels catfish can grow as long as 4m and up to 62st. However, it is rare to catch one that is over two meters long.

Facebook   Hooked: Dino caught the fish in the Po Delta in Italy where the biggest catfish ever caught was 22 stone

The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything it comes across. They have been filmed eating pigeons that get too close.

In December 14-year-old Sam Lee caught a 15st catfish while on holiday in Spain.

The Chester schoolboy was with dad Peter when the 2.5m carnivorous fish snatched the live bait at the end of his line.

It immediately bolted 100m downstream, but Sam hung on - and eventually landed it after a 35 minute battle.

He then posed for a traditional photo to secure bragging rights before letting the creature swim back into the water at the River Ebro in Catalonia."
2162,"Reports that 11 commercial jetliners are missing from the main airport in Libya's capital of Tripoli are raising fears that militants could use them in terrorist attacks to mark the 13th anniversary of 9/11 next week.

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website, cited anonymous sources who said intelligence agencies have warned the jets could be used in attacks in North Africa and elsewhere on Sept. 11.

The date also marks the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.

State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, ""We have nothing to confirm these reports about missing airliners.""

A spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, also said there's been no confirmation that aircraft had been stolen.

Images have surfaced online showing militants posing with the jetliners taken when the militants overran Tripoli's airport last month in a fierce battle that left much of the airport and its aircraft damaged.

In the past four months, a renegade general has battled Islamic militants in the eastern city of Benghazi — cradle of the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi — as powerful regional militias have fought for control of the Tripoli airport. Islamist-allied militias have seized virtually all of the capital.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui said there was ""credible intelligence"" that one Libyan militia ""is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the (region) on the 9/11 anniversary,"" The Huffington Post reported, citing Al Jazeera television.

An aviation security expert said the planes, if actually seized by terrorists, would pose more of a threat to countries near Libya than the U.S. homeland.

Any stolen aircraft from Libya would unlikely penetrate post-9/11 U.S. air defense and security measures, but they could pose a threat to targets that are much closer, said Jeffrey Price, author of Practical Aviation Security and professor at Metropolitan State University in Denver.

Airliners are required to file flight plans before entering U.S. airspace, and air-traffic monitors would be looking for aircraft matching the description of any stolen planes, Price said. An airliner could try to fly below radar to avoid detection, but the U.S. military has developed systems to detect and stop low flying threats, he said.

Price said most countries near Libya, including in Europe, do not have the same air-defense capabilities and would be more at risk.

The reports of the missing planes, which first surfaced in mid-August, likely sparked an international search for the planes by intelligence agencies, Price said. ""It's hard to hide a big jet,"" he said.

The latest report surfaced after an Islamist militia seized a U.S. Embassy residence in Tripoli last weekend, posting video online of men playing in a pool at the compound. In late July, U.S. diplomats evacuated the compound and the capital and traveled to neighboring Tunisia under a U.S. military escort as fighting between rival militias intensified and thousands fled.

About 150,000 people have fled Libya during the fighting and another 100,000 have been internally displaced, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.

2163,"Elected officials and activists in New York are reacting positively to the city's new policy that loosens how it treats people found in possession of marijuana.

Many had earlier said that young minority males often were the subject of arrests for marijuana possession, and asserted that punishment for what they considered a relatively minor crime could often affect a person's entire future.

""In light of the fact that there have been a disproportionate amount of blacks and browns subjected to low level marijuana arrests, as well as the fact that many cities around the country are legalizing marijuana use, it is timely for the City of New York to revise its policies,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York City-based activist, in a statement.

""With excessive gun violence, hard drug trafficking, and other criminal ills that have plagued our community, I feel that the police ought to concentrate on things of importance rather than things that are now being legalized in many places around the country,"" he said.

Starting Nov. 19, anyone found with less than 25 grams of the drug on them will be issued a summons rather than being arrested, the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. The only caveat is there must not be a warrant out for the person's arrest and they must not be found near a location that presents extra concern, such as a school, according to the city.

""This new policy will reduce unnecessary arrests for minor marijuana possession and put an end to an era where many of young New Yorkers were being arrested and saddled with criminal records for minor violations,"" de Blasio said. ""Today's action is the latest in a series of steps Commissioner Bratton and I have taken to rebuild the relationship between the NYPD and the communities they serve. We are also enhancing public safety with this new initiative by directing police resources towards more serious crime, and not wasting officer time processing unnecessary arrests.""

Voices of dissent with the current policy were underscored by Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, who said in July that he would not prosecute low-level marijuana possession cases because of the concerns about how such arrests can affect the lives of young, minority men.

NYC MARIJUANA POLICY: Official eases practices for low-level offenses

Five black and Hispanic members of the New York City Council applauded the mayor's move and said that on Oct. 31, they jointly sent a letter to the mayor and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton calling for an end to such arrests.

""The mayor and commissioner have taken a significant step towards ensuring fewer New Yorkers face the consequences that arrest records bring,"" read a joint statement from the council members: Ritchie Torres, Rafael Espinal, Carlos Menchaca, Antonio Reynoso and Donovan Richards.

""We commend the mayor and commissioner for this move, and we will continue to monitor its implementation,"" the council members said. ""The relationship between police and communities, particularly communities of color, frayed significantly during the previous administration. Today's announcement will make substantial progress towards rebuilding that relationship. We look forward to working with the Mayor and Commissioner to implement additional measures needed to restore trust between police and communities."""
2164,"He may have been a few hours late, but a Newfoundland man who vowed to police over Facebook that he would turn himself in has kept his promise.
Newfoundland police said over Twitter Monday afternoon that Rodney Constantine had “kept his word” and turned himself over to authorities after saying he would so in a Facebook comment -- to police.
On Saturday, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary used their Facebook and Twitter accounts to appeal to the public in helping finding Constantine, who was wanted on four warrants, including failing to attend court and breaching court orders.
Not shy -- nor apparently trying to elude authorities -- Constantine responded using his own Facebook account. He wrote on the post: “See you Monday morn !!!!!”
The unusual example of the power of social media in policing took another bizarre twist in the comment’s section, where Constantine and police began a correspondence of sorts.
After noting that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, police wrote: “We commend Mr. Constantine for acknowledging these charges and hopefully he will contact us to have the matter dealt with properly in court.”
Constantine took to Facebook again, just to make it clear he was serious about his imminent surrender: “Look just letting everyone know this ain’t a joke or intended !!!! I was just been honest about turning in Monday morn that’s all !!!”
The unusual back-and-forth sparked a slew of comments from Facebook users, including one person who said police should offer free pick-up and drop-off service for wanted persons.
The police also took the opportunity to chastise people making rude remarks.
“We also would ask that people commenting on posts consider a more tactful and less offensive tone as many of your comments are being ‘hidden’ for simply being outright offensive toward other users or the accused.”
The “wanted” post seeking the accused has since been deleted from the RNC’s Facebook page, but police did post news of Constantine’s arrest, saying he will be seen by a provincial court judge Tuesday morning."
2165,"The masked Islamic State militant known as ""Jihadi John"", who has been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of Western hostages, has been named.

The BBC understands he is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born British man in his mid-20s from west London, who was known to UK security services.

They chose not to disclose his name earlier for operational reasons.

Emwazi first appeared in a video last August, when he apparently killed the American journalist James Foley.

He was later thought to have been pictured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

'The Beatles'

In each of the videos, the militant appeared dressed in a black robe with a black balaclava covering all but his eyes and top of his nose.

Speaking with a British accent, he taunted Western powers before holding his knife to the hostages' necks, appearing to start cutting before the film stopped. The victims' decapitated bodies were then shown.

Earlier this month, the militant featured in a video in which the Japanese journalist Kenji Goto appeared to be beheaded.

Hostages released by IS said he was one of three British jihadists guarding Westerners abducted by the group in Syria. They were given the nicknames ""John"", ""Paul"" and ""Ringo"" by their captives, and were known collectively as ""the Beatles"".

Analysis: Dominic Casciani, BBC News

We don't know exactly when the British or the American security services worked out that the masked man in the killing videos was Londoner Mohammed Emwazi.

But we do know that he was a ""person of interest"" to MI5 going back to at least 2010 because he features in semi-secret court cases relating to extremism overseas and back in the UK.

Nobody in official security circles is going to comment on what they know and why they know it.

Emwazi has been previously described as a member of a network involving at least 13 men from London - and at least two of them were subjected to house arrest control orders or T-Pims. One absconded. The chances of Emwazi ever returning to the UK are vanishingly small.

Follow Dominic at @BBCDomC

BBC News special correspondent Lucy Manning says Emwazi is understood to be about 27 years of age.

Friends told the Washington Post that he was raised in a middle class area of West London and studied computer programming at the University of Westminster. He would on occasion pray at a mosque in Greenwich, they said.

Emwazi's friends told the Washington Post that they believed he started to be radicalised after travelling to Tanzania in May 2009 following his graduation.

He and two friends had planned to go on a safari, but once they landed in Dar es Salaam, they were detained by police and held overnight, they said.

Emwazi then ended up flying to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, where he claimed to be met by British intelligence agents from MI5 who accused him of trying to travel to Somalia, where the jihadist group al-Shabab operates. He denied the accusation and said the agents had tried to recruit him before allowing him to return to the UK.

The incident is apparently described in a report published the following year by the Independent. It identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

'Live investigation'

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, he was detained by British counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back to Kuwait, his friends said.

It is believed he was known to security services in the UK and the US before leaving for Syria and was linked to a man with connections to al-Shabab, says the BBC's Dominic Casciani.

The Washington Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and later joined Islamic State, which has declared the creation of a ""caliphate"" in the large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq it controls.

British police declined to comment on the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

2167,"(Reuters) - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, described them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: ""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ""snow bride"" wearing a bra and lipstick. ""The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. ""It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"" one wrote.

""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.""

2168,"In a new video posted online, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claims it has captured weapons and ammunition dropped by the U.S. military that was intended for Kurdish forces defending an embattled Syrian city near the Turkish border.

The airdrops Sunday were the first of their kind and followed weeks of U.S. and coalition airstrikes in and near Kobani.

In the video, ISIS claims some of the weapons and ammunition was air-dropped by mistake on its positions in Kobani.



A senior administration official told CBS News on Sunday that the majority - but not necessarily all - of the bundles dropped by U.S. forces appeared to ‎make it to their intended targets.

""We are still assessing the completion of the mission but every indication that we have is that the vast majority of those bundles were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces,"" the official said. ""We're still working through a complete assessment right now.‎""

Because the drops were made overnight, the Pentagon could not say with 100 certainty that they reached their intended destinations.

Idris Nassan, a senior Kurdish official from Kobani who is now in the Turkish town of Mursitpinar, confirmed the Kurdish fighters received the airdrop and asked for more weapons.

""We are not in need of fighters. We are able to defeat the terrorists of ISIS if we have weaponry - enough weaponry and enough ammunition,"" he told The Associated Press.

Kurdish fighters tweeted messages of appreciation along with photos that apparently show that some of the air-dropped cargo - including M-16 guns and medical supplies - did reach its intended recipients."

2171,"Over the weekend, Reddit user fryd_ posted a letter that Lego included in boxes of its toy building bricks in the 1970s. Addressed to parents, the note has a message about gender equality and gendered children's products that many toy companies today still don't seem to understand.

The letter reads:

To Parents. The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls. It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship. A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses. The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.

The Reddit user told Buzzfeed that he found the note while playing with Legos with his niece and nephew at their grandmother's house. ""It struck me as particularly modern message for something written 40 years ago,"" he said, adding, ""I thought the toy-makers of today could learn a thing or two!""

This letter's message is consistent with the gender-neutral Lego ad from 1981 that made the Internet rounds back in February. The creator of the ad, Judy Lotas, told The Huffington Post, ""Boys and girls are different, but not to the exclusion of wanting to create and build. That’s not a gender issue.""

PGA Tour media official Joel Schuchmann released a statement on behalf of the Tour, saying, “Regarding the allegations made by Dan Olsen concerning Tiger Woods, there is no truth whatsoever to his claims and the PGA Tour categorically denies them.”

The Michigan-based pro added he believes Woods was faking the back tightness that Woods cited in withdrawing from the Farmers Insurance Open after just 11 holes.

Olsen, whose last PGA Tour start was the 2011 PGA Championship, also made several wild accusations concerning Woods’ golf ball, incorrectly identifying dates during which Woods made changes in the ball he uses. Olsen alluded to comments made by Golf Channel analyst Frank Nobilo concerning the advantage he felt Woods had in 2000 (not 1998 or 1999 as Olsen claimed) in switching to Nike’s first solid-core golf ball. After switch in May 2000, Woods went on to win the final three majors that year, just before Titleist introduced its Pro V1.

Further, Olsen claimed Rory McIlroy wanted out of his Nike contract if he couldn’t have access to the same ball as Woods.

Switching subjects, Olsen also claimed PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem personally visited Dustin Johnson’s home twice in an effort to help the pro with his “personal challenges” before a six-month leave of absence from golf that ended in February. Johnson has disputed a Golf.com report saying he was suspended for that half-year period because of a failed drug test under the Tour’s anti-doping program."
2176,"Longtime ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Tom Brokaw reportedly wants his successor, Brian Williams, thrown out of the big chair after he admitted fabricating key portions of a story he repeatedly told about his reporting experience during the Iraq War in 2003.

The New York Post, citing sources at the network, reported that Brokaw, 74, has been ""making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report.""

Brokaw was the anchor of NBC's flagship evening newscast when Williams filed his initial report in March 2003. In it, Williams described how he was traveling in a group of helicopters forced down in the Iraq desert. On the ground, Williams said, he learned the Chinook in front of him ""had almost been blown out of the sky""; he showed a photo of the aircraft with a gash from a rocket-propelled grenade.

Williams succeeded Brokaw as the ""Nightly News"" anchor following the 2004 presidential election, and his story evolved over time.

In a 2008 blog post, Williams said that his helicopter had come under fire from what appeared to be Iraqi farmers with rocket-propelled grenade. He said a helicopter in front of his had been hit.

Then, in a 2013 appearance on David Letterman's ""Late Show"" on CBS, Williams said that two of the four helicopters he was traveling with had been hit by ground fire, ""including the one I was in.""

On Wednesday, Williams recanted that story, claiming he was that he was flying in a Chinook helicopter behind the formation that took fire. However, on Thursday, the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, which broke the story, reported that Williams was actually flying with a different helicopter company altogether, in a different direction, and linked to the attacked unit only by radio.

Adding to the intrigue, the Post reported that Brokaw and former NBC News president Steve Capus, who left the network in 2013, knew that Williams' updated version of his tale was not true before the anchor's admission Wednesday evening. The paper also says NBC News executives had counseled Williams to stop telling the story.

Despite Brokaw's campaign, the paper says NBC will take no action against Williams, believing that his on-air apology Wednesday will suffice.

""He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way,"" one source told the paper. ""He has the full support of NBC News.""

2177,"On Monday morning, a report surfaced claiming that Comcast has been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, a browsing program designed to allow users to surf the Internet with greater anonymity than most browsers. Monday’s report was repackaged on a number of other sites, stating that Comcast has ""declared war on the Tor Browser."" The report goes on to suggest that Comcast has contacted some users telling them that they risk disconnection if they continue using Tor. The report may have generated a lot of clicks but is totally inaccurate.  

Comcast is not asking customers to stop using Tor, or any other browser for that matter. We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software. Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website, use any app, and so forth. 

Here are the facts:

Comcast doesn’t monitor our customer’s browser software, web surfing or online history.

The anecdotal chat room evidence described in these reports is not accurate.  

We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process, just like other ISPs. More information about these policies can be found in our Transparency Report here.

We do not terminate customers for violating the Copyright Alert System (aka ""six strikes""), which is a non-punitive, educational and voluntary copyright program. Read more here.

Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself.  I’m sure many of them are using it right now."
2178,"Comcast has lately found itself issuing public apologies on a somewhat regular basis as subscribers share tales of horrible customer service.

But the latest accusation leveled against Comcast—that it is threatening to disconnect customers who use the anonymity-providing Tor browser—hasn't been backed by convincing evidence that it's happening. And Comcast dismisses the rumor as “wildly inaccurate.”

It began Saturday with a site called DeepDotWeb claiming that Comcast has “declared war on Tor Browser.”

“Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service,” the article said. “A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an ‘illegal service.’ The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies. The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer. The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor.”

“Kelly” allegedly told the customer that “Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules.”

“I think the story is nonsense”

There was good reason to be skeptical of this report. A search of the subreddit /r/darknetmarkets for Comcast and Tor turned up nothing. (UPDATE: Here is the reddit post quoted by DeepDotWeb.) Any organized Comcast campaign against users of Tor would likely inspire numerous customer complaints, not just a few, as noted by Cato Institute Research Fellow Julian Sanchez and security researcher Robert Graham, who wrote on Twitter:


""This story is wildly inaccurate,"" Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas told Ars. ""Customers are free to use their Xfinity Internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise.""

While Comcast publishes an acceptable use policy, the company ""doesn’t monitor users’ browser software or Web surfing and has no program addressing the Tor browser,"" Douglas said.

In some previous cases where customers have documented poor customer service, Comcast has admitted fault and said its customer service agents acted in error. In this case, Comcast says it investigated the story and found no evidence that the encounters ever happened.

""The anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents’ messages and is not accurate,"" Douglas said. ""Per our own internal review, we have found no evidence that these conversations took place, nor do we employ a Security Assurance team member named Kelly. We respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customer's account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process.""

Comcast's Jason Livingood, VP of Internet communications and engineering, also disputed the report in a blog post today. ""Our customers can use Tor at any time, as I have myself. I’m sure many of them are using it right now,"" he wrote.

The DeepDotWeb report has other problems. It falsely stated that ""Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the 'Six Strikes' plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are e-mailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the 'Six Strikes' plan five more times, their Internet service will be terminated.""

In fact, Six Strikes reports are the result of content companies monitoring online activity and notifying Internet service providers of potential violations. Comcast says it uses e-mail and in-browser alerts to ""educate"" customers about copyright violations, but it doesn't cut off service. Nonetheless, the DeepDotWeb report was credulously re-reported by a few other news outlets that didn't seek further confirmation. The stories are being shared by Twitter users, who often add expressions of outrage:


Tor isn't for criminals

Tor Project Executive Director Andrew Lewman told Ars that it doesn't have enough information on the Comcast rumors ""to know whether this is a company-wide practice."" He noted that ""people with uncensored connections to the Internet can use Tor to share their access with human rights defenders and journalists behind national firewalls. We tend to have good relationships with Internet service providers in free societies for this reason.""

Tor itself was unfairly branded ""the Web browser for criminals"" by one news report:


Enlarge
Business Insider
While Tor can be used by criminals, it was created by the US Naval Research Laboratory to protect government communications and is used by many people with privacy concerns, including activists in countries with repressive governments. For anyone hoping to use Tor to mask downloads of pirated material, the Tor Project itself says that ""File sharing (peer-to-peer/P2P) is widely unwanted in the Tor network, and exit nodes are configured to block file sharing traffic by default."" (Comcast was caught interfering with BitTorrent traffic in 2007.)

If the customers described by DeepDotWeb did have discussions with Comcast employees, it's possible they were being notified of a pending legal action. DeepDotWeb quoted Comcast as saying, ""if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.""

Douglas told Ars that ""it's impossible to speculate"" whether that's what happened in this case, since the reports mentioned no specific customers.

If any Ars readers are subscribers of Comcast and use the Tor browser, we'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments."

In fact, the telecast of the game between the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs will feature just a regular pregame show. There was never, the network says, a panel discussion about the topic planned for tonight.

The network was hammered with calls after an Esquire blog post (“ESPN Has a Problem with Women”) indicated that an all-male lineup would debate the topic, which has been a hot once since the second Ray Rice video surfaced three weeks ago. On Monday, in the third game since the explosive video triggered the NFL’s domestic violence crisis, “it’s a normal lineup for ‘Monday Night Football,’” according to Chris LaPlaca, ESPN’s senior vice-president of corporate communications.

That lineup, of course, includes Suzy Kolber, who hosts the two-hour “Monday Night Countdown” show, and Lisa Salters, reporter and sideline reporter. In a statement on the matter, John Wildhack, executive vice-president of programming and production, said:

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting and Lisa Salters reporting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more."
2184,"Obesity rates in America have more than doubled over the last 2 decades and has become the leading public health issue in the U.S. With more than two-thirds of the adult population overweight, McDonald’s has decided to become part of the obesity rate solution – not the problem.

According to reports, beginning January 1, 2015, McDonald’s will no longer serve customers who show risks of being overweight. They will define overweight by these standards: Over 170 lbs for women and 245 lbs for men. Children’s weight restrictions will vary depending on age and height.

McDonald’s is currently running campaigns to shake its “junk food” image, insisting they sell nothing but good quality food. They are are branding themselves from “A dining experience of fast food” to “Good food served fast.” They want people to understand the risks of being overweight.

So how will they know if you are overweight ? Will they ask you what you weigh and trust your answer? NO

They are implementing scales at the from of every register just like the one in the photo below. You must stand on the scale when ordering or you will not be served. They also plan on posting signs to let customers know that they have the legal “Right to refuse service to anyone.”

For drive-thru patrons it may be a bit more difficult to enforce. However, if the person looks like they exceed the weight restrictions, they will be refused service at the drive-thru window."

Inquisitr reports that the internet was aflame with reactions after fake news that country legend Willie Nelson had died. Although 81-years-old, the legendary crooner has not yet kicked the bucket.

The rumor about Nelson's demise first began on the fake site MSMBC, according to Inquisitr. The initials for the site so closely mirror the actual news organization MSNBC that people glancing at the headline understood it to be true.

The fact the story cited made up police officials also lent it an undeserved air of credibility. The story claimed that Nelson's body was found on the front lawn of a property he owns in Maui, HI.

2187,"The most expensive Apple Watch set to go on sale in April will have to cost around $10,000, according to analysis done by the timepiece blog Grail Watch.

That's mostly because the Apple Watch Edition has a frame made from solid 18-karat gold, which is very expensive.

Grail Watch notes that gold sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per ounce these days. By that measure, the Apple Watch Edition's frame would cost around $8,300 for the larger 42mm version, excluding all other costs.

That's assuming the watch's case is made from solid gold, not gold-plated. But the blog notes that Apple's marketing material never uses ""gold-plated"" or ""gold-filled,"" which is conventional terminology for gold-plated materials, and that Apple must abide by laws governing how jewelry makers describe their products.

The conventional wisdom so far has been that the Apple Watch Edition will cost $5,000. Apple has only announced the price of the low-end Apple Watch Sport, which will sell for $349.

But gold-framed luxury watches usually go for well above the $10,000 mark. Cartier's Tank MC lists for $22,000 and Jager-LeCoultre's Reverso Squadra Hometime lists for over $23,000.

Even if the Apple Watch Edition sells for less than its analog competitors, it will still be Apple's most expensive product.

Grail Watch predicts the larger Apple Watch Edition will go for $9,999, with the smaller version retailing for $7,999."
2188,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."
2191,"(CNN) -- Despite government claims of a ceasefire, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town near the border with Niger, killing at least 8 and kidnapping others, residents told CNN Saturday.

Boko Haram has not yet responded to the government's announcement Thursday of a ceasefire, which an official said heralded peace in the country after some five years of conflict with the Islamic extremist group.

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

Nigerian officials said Friday that the government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram, which has been waging an insurgency in the country's north since 2009.

The deal, the government said, includes the release of more than 200 kidnapped girls whose abduction from their boarding school shocked the world in April.

The deal, first reported by Agence France-Presse, came Thursday night after a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan.

Nigerian officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby, according to Tukur.

""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" Tukur said.

Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, said the ceasefire deal was meant not only to free the girls but also to end the insurgency.

""On the war front, we can say there is peace now,"" he said Friday.

What is Boko Haram?

A source involved in talks with the militants told CNN last month that Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross had discussions with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the group for the more than 200 schoolgirls. It is unclear, however, whether the deal includes a prisoner swap.

The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

As part of its insurgency, the militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.

2192,"WATCHERS of North Korea's secretive regime believe it could be planning another surprise move, a restaurant in Scotland.

The Cambodia eaterie
Leader Kim Jong-Un has already opened a diner in Amsterdam, with the 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants also having branches in China and parts of Asia.

It has been reported that the dictator is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK, with claims by observers of North Korea that Kim is especially keen on an eaterie in Scotland.

His fondness of whisky and the profile of Scotland's referendum have been cited as key reasons for the potential serving of North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel in Scotland.

Proceeds from the 'Pyongyang' chain are funnelled back into North Korean government funds.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He said: ""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

""Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

""Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

This giant catfish, which weighed 20 stone (127kg) was caught by twin brothers Dino and Dario Ferrari in the Po River of northern Italy.

Dino Ferrari caught the 127 kg catfish in the Po delta of Italy (Sportex Italia)

Believed to be one of the largest of its kind ever caught, the creature was pulled from the river on Feb 19 with a rod and line after a battle lasting 40 minutes.

The nine foot-long creature, a wels catfish, has been dubbed “the monster of the Po” by the Italian media.

The fish was released after the trophy photos (Sportex Italia)

After catching, weighing and photographing it, the brothers released it back into the river, which flows across northern Italy to the Adriatic.

“It’s a silurus glanis [the Latin name for the species],” Dino Ferrari said. “The American catfish doesn’t grow to such large dimensions – at most it can weigh 50kg.” He estimated the fish to be about 30 years old, based on its size, adding that the species can live for up to 50 years.

“They don’t range over very large distances, they tend to live in the same stretch of river, moving just a few kilometres either way. They eat all types of fish.

""To catch them you need a lot of patience but also physical strength. We fought for 40 minutes to reel it in. We tired it out and then lifted it out of the water.”

The wels catfish, also known as the sheatfish, lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia but was introduced to western Europe.

The fish prey on other fish, as well as worms, crustaceans, frogs and water fowl.

“Who knows, maybe we will manage to catch it again in a year’s time, and it will be even more gigantic,” said Mr Ferrari."
2197,"Islamic State brutes fed a distraught woman searching for her kidnapped son some meat and rice – and then told her she had just eaten her son, according to a British man who joined the fight against ISIS.

Yasir Abdulla, 36, of Yorkshire left his wife and four kids to battle the maniacal extremists in his Kurdish homeland, The Sun reported.

“I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe,” he said. “Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul. She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him.”

He said the thugs told her to rest after her long journey and offered her the food before taking her to her son.

“They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind,” he said.“But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, ‘You’ve just eaten him,’” Abdulla told The Sun.

Abdulla decided to take on the murderous group after they came within six miles of his home in Kurdistan.

He said he bought combat fatigues online and an assault rifle in his Kurdish hometown – then joined other volunteers on the front lines.

“We want to attack IS and drive them out forever but we can’t unless the Peshmerga and the Americans say we can,” he said, referring to the military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Abdulla described the jihadists’ terror tactics, including slaughtering prisoners in bonfires.

“They dig a trench, put dry tree branches and leaves in there, set it alight and then throw prisoners on so they burn alive,” he said. “IS are very good at making people scared. If they make one person scared then that person will make another person scared and soon everyone is scared of IS.”

“But the Kurds are not scared of them. Someone has to stand and fight. We have got thousands of people in many villages and towns behind us. If we fall then all of those places fall, and that can’t happen.”

Yasir, who returned to the UK last week, remains confident and vows to return to Iraq to help the rebels defeat the fanatics."

2202,"The ""Jihadi John"" killer who has featured in several Islamic State in Iraq and Syria beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle class family who grew up in London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming, the Washington Post newspaper said.

In videos released by ISIS, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons.

The BBC said Emwazi is suspected of appearing in videos that showed the killings of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, who also went by Peter.

The black-clad militant also appeared in videos in January 2015 that showed Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, who were later killed.

The Post said Emwazi was believed to have travelled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined ISIS.

""His real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming,"" the Post said.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

The paper said he had been born in Kuwait, was raised in a middle-class neighbourhood in London and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, southeast London.

Police declined to comment on the reports.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter- terrorism investigation,"" said Commander Richard Walton of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command in a statement.

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London.

They said Emwazi and two friends - a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib - never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster."

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before, but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.'

Nikolai added that he has now decided he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people.

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

Factory worker Leonid Tenkaev pictured in 2004. He claimed to have obtained the ability to attract metal objects following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets', many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material.

In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7kg of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin."

When contacted for comment by CNN, the White House referred questions to the Pentagon which, int turn, declined to comment on the case--including on which of the five men is in touch with Haqqani.

However, U.S. intelligence set up to intercept all five men's communications in Qatar has revealed that one of them 'reached out' in recent months to try to encourage militant activity.

2208,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video.

A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners.

 A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.

Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda.

Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region.

The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias.

Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli. The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second-story balcony at the facility.

Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July. Photos of the airport in the aftermath showed a number of damaged aircraft. The airport has been closed since mid-July.

The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s. Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.

The aircraft were reportedly taken in late August following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport, located about 20 miles south of the capital, by Libyan Dawn.

Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets.

In response, Tunisia stopped flights from other Libyan airports at Tripoli, Sirte, and Misrata over concerns that jets from those airports could be on suicide missions.

Egypt’s government also halted flights to and from Libya.

Military forces in North Africa, including those from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft.

Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently, and U.S. officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi was quoted as denying Egyptian air strikes into Libya have taken place but suggested that military action is being considered.

Secretary of State John Kerry last week told his Egyptian counterpart that the United States would speed up the delivery of Apache attack helicopters, although it is not clear the Apaches would be used in any Libyan operations.

Egypt’s military-backed government appears to be seeking a more significant role in regional security after the Obama administration helped engineer the ouster of Libyan strongman Moammar Qaddafi in 2011. Since then, the Obama  administration, through its announced policy of “leading from behind,” has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos.

The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli.

“We announce that the majority of the ministries, institutions, and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control,” a government statement said.

Libya’s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government.

Ansar al Sharia, which is based in Benghazi, recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons, including SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria.

Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December.

The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012.

Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.

Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9/11 anniversary.

Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.

“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”

Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.

“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”

Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.

“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.

A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.

The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"
2210,"Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected.

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday’s incident.

Hurricane Floyd aftermath
According to investigators, long time employee Philip Canseco was seen vomiting in the facilities restroom three days prior to the incident on Friday. “I was passing by the restroom, when I heard somebody throwing up inside,” said one Texas Prime Turkey Farm employee. “I opened the door and looked inside and saw Canseco throwing up in one of the urinals. I asked him if he was okay, he said yes, and I left. I didn’t want to get close to him and get sick.”

Management confirmed that Canseco worked three full work days at the facility with flu-like symptoms, before passing out unconscious with a fever of 106°. Due to his symptoms, he was rushed to a local hazmat tent where he tested positive for the Ebola virus. The CDC reports an additional 7 coworkers are being quarantined and tested. However, they have not released those results as of yet.

The facility has been ordered by the CDC to burn their entire flock of turkeys, over 250,000. Texas Prime Turkey Farm is requesting permission from the state of Texas to send the shipment of incinerated turkey ashes to Veolia’s Port Arthur environmental waste facility. This facility has already accepted one shipment of Ebola waste from household goods where Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed. Duncan was the first man to die of  Ebola on US soil.


 
Activists are protesting the shipments of contaminated Ebola waste to their community. “We feel every precaution should be taken to protect our community, our children and our elderly. We are not a dumping ground for the nations, or the world’s bio waste.”


Plant manager Mitch Osborne said on Saturday that even though no contract has yet been signed, the plant will likely receive the second shipment of contaminated Ebola waste. “It is a safe and sound process,” Osborne said. “I am not going to place my employees in harms way, or the community. The company is here to improve the environment and I believe we are doing a pretty darn good job of that. I believe we are doing the right and safe thing.”

A spokesperson for Texas Prime Turkey Farm said there is a good chance Ebola turkeys may have already shipped out to major suppliers for distribution. Each retailer will have to perform recalls individually if they feel they have received a contaminated shipment"

But what we didn't learn, however, is how long its battery would last on a single charge.

That may be because Apple is still working out this detail, as a new report suggests.

Attributing anonymous sources, Re/code's John Paczkowski reports that Apple isn't happy with the watch's battery life just yet. In its current form, the watch's battery life will not break any industry standards, Paczkowski says.

Right now, the Apple Watch's battery life is about one day, but Paczkowski's sources say Apple is working on some modifications to make the watch last longer on a charge before its 2015 launch.

This aligns with what we've heard from Apple as well, since a company representative told us the watch can be charged at night. Apple hasn't offered any further comment on the watch's battery life.

Battery life has been one of the biggest obstacles facing wearable devices. That's because a lot of smartwatches run on components that are meant for smartphones and aren't properly optimized for wrist-worn gadgets, Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys Insight, told Business Insider in a previous interview.

""We're expecting so much from these early products in the market when we don't really have dedicated components to go inside these devices,"" Jones said. ""We're nowhere near seeing the best of what can be developed out there.""

2 dead in shooting attack at Canada’s Parliament

OTTAWA, Ontario—A Canadian soldier standing guard at a war memorial in the country’s capital was shot to death Wednesday, and heavy gunfire then erupted inside Parliament. One gunman was killed, and police said they were hunting for as many as two others.

The bloodshed immediately raised the specter of a coordinated terrorist attack, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by a man who police say was fired up with radical Muslim fervor.

Witnesses said the soldier was gunned down at point-blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, with a scarf over his face. They said the gunman then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Police gave no details on how the gunman died. But on Twitter, Member of Parliament Craig Scott credited Parliament sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms.

Ottawa police spokesman Chuck Benoit said two or three gunmen were believed to be involved in the attacks.

Gilles Michaud, assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, called it a “dynamic, unfolding situation.”

Ottawa Hospital said it received two patients, both listed in stable condition, in addition to the soldier.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as “outrageous,” and in a telephone call with the prime minister, offered U.S. help and reassurance of the American people’s solidarity with Canada.

The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

Tony Zobl said he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

“I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,” Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency.

“The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.”

Zobl said the gunman then ran up the street toward Parliament Hill.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.

“I’m safe locked in a office awaiting security,” Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill."

2217,"In an aptly described “joint policy initiative,” Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton announced Monday that most people caught with small amounts of marijuana in the city will get slapped with summonses instead of arrested.

The historic move marked a public about-face for Bratton, who earlier this year vowed NYPD practices wouldn’t change after the Brooklyn district attorney’s decision not to prosecute first-time offenders for low-level pot possession.

Sources said the new policy was ordered by de Blasio, whose campaign promises included ending marijuana arrests that overwhelmingly targeted minorities.

“It began with the mayor, as his initiative,” said an elected official familiar with the issue. “It was something very dear to the mayor that had to happen, no matter what.”

Bratton, the sources noted, did not resist de Blasio’s directive.

The NYPD declined to comment. City Hall credited both men with the idea.

“This is a joint policy initiative, developed and implemented by Commissioner Bratton and the leadership team at the NYPD, and fully supported by the mayor,” a de Blasio spokesman said.

Joined by de Blasio at 1 Police Plaza, Bratton said he and other police officials had been working on the change in policing tactics for “the last number of months.”Under the new policy,people busted for possessing 25 grams or less of pot — a violation under New York law — will no longer be cuffed, hauled off to a police station, fingerprinted and booked.

Bratton held up a plastic sandwich bag stuffed almost full of oregano to illustrate how big a stash was at issue.

“To give you, the public, a sense of what 25 grams of marijuana would look like, that’s about it,” he said.

“It’s not a large amount.”

Chief Thomas Purtell of the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau put the value of that much actual weed at $300.

The new policy covers only marijuana that appears to be for “personal use,” rather than for sale. Anyone caught smoking in public will still be subject to arrest regardless of the amount of pot in view, the commissioner said.

Other exceptions to the no-arrest rule include people with open arrest warrants, those wanted in connection with active investigations or pot carriers who don’t have identification.

Bratton said the policy would be put into writing and a training video would be shown to cops during roll call before it goes into effect on Nov. 19.

But law-enforcement sources said an unwritten version of the policy was enacted “on the command level” about a year and a half ago under then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.

“If you saw someone smoking a joint, you would bring them back to the precinct and give them a summons if they didn’t have a record,” a source said.

Kelly declined to comment Monday.

The new policy effectively neutralizes Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson’s refusal to prosecute low-level pot arrests, which he said were clogging the justice system and taking “an unnecessary toll on offenders.”

It also maintains a revenue stream for the city, because the summonses carry fines of up to $100 for first-time offenders and up to $250 for second-timers.

In a statement, Thompson said, “I applaud Mayor de Blasio’s decision.” which he called “similar to the approach that I have taken in Brooklyn.”

But he said he was “concerned about the due-process rights” of Brooklynites who get issued pot summonses, because almost all Brooklyn violations are prosecuted in Manhattan Criminal Court.

De Blasio described the new policy as a win-win. win, especially for young minorities., saying, “We don’t want to saddle people who have made one small mistake with something that will follow them for the rest of their lives.”

“It will certainly be good for New Yorkers of color, and particularly young people of color,” the mayor said.

“When an individual is arrested, even for the smallest possession of marijuana, it hurts their chances to get a good job, it hurts their chances to get housing, it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan — it can literally follow them the rest of their lives and saddle young people with challenges that for many are very, very difficult to overcome,” the mayor said.

“I think you will see fewer unnecessary arrests,” he said.

Monday’s announcement followed a Post report last week that revealed the NYPD had stopped marijuana “buy and bust” operations to focus on harder drugs.

Bratton called the article “false” Monday while admitting he had changed strategy to target only “significant” drug sales.

Law-enforcement sources on Monday confirmed the accuracy of the Post report and said they weren’t surprised by Bratton’s denialattempt to dance around the issue.

“You can’t go on the record that you’re pulling back on marijuana arrests when it’s a law on the books,” one source said.

2218,"Matt Taibbi, the star magazine writer hired earlier this year to start a satirical website for billionaire Pierre Omidyar's First Look Media, is on a leave of absence from the company after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar's organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.

Taibbi's abrupt disappearance from the company's Fifth Avenue headquarters has cast doubt on the fate of his highly anticipated digital publication, reportedly to be called Racket, which First Look executives had previously said would launch sometime this autumn.

When he was hired, amid much fanfare, Taibbi's website was meant to be the second in an envisioned fleet of titles to be published by First Look, an ambitious digital journalism company funded by Omidyar, the founder of eBay and one of the richest tech moguls in America. Like its counterpart the Intercept, launched earlier this year by Glenn Greenwald and others to pursue investigations of NSA surveillance and the intelligence world, it was a venture centered around a brand-name polemicist without much management experience. Prior to joining First Look, Taibbi made his name by gleefully skewering fat targets for Rolling Stone — most famously, he described Goldman Sachs as ""a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity"" — and he said at the time of his departure that he was lured away by the chance to lampoon the financial industry in the ""simultaneously funny and satirical voice"" associated with the legendary magazine Spy. Over the succeeding months, the mission of the publication broadened to encompass political satire as well, and it brought on a number of high-profile names from the New York digital scene, including deputy editor Alex Pareene, formerly of Salon; Laura Dawn, a digital video producer who formerly worked with Moveon.org; and Edith Zimmerman, founding editor of the Hairpin.

""Journalists should be dark, funny, mean people,"" Taibbi told New York in an interview in March. ""It's appropriate for their antagonistic, adversarial role.""

Omidyar originally conceived of First Look as a network of interlinking sites run by ""independent"" journalists, many of whom took a similarly adversarial approach to journalism. Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple — a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii — to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi. The confrontational approach that made Taibbi's name at Rolling Stone — and before that, as the founding editor of the gonzo Moscow expatriate magazine The eXile — appears to have contributed to internal trouble at First Look.

Sources confirmed that Taibbi has been absent from the office for several weeks, only returning on one brief occasion to address the staff. Although those hired have been reassured that the project would continue on during the unspecified term of Taibbi's absence, the launch date for Racket — which Taibbi indicated in September would be coming ""in a month"" — now appears to have been pushed off.

""We have a target date but I wouldn’t make a launch date public,"" said Temple, who is based in San Francisco, when reached by phone this morning. ""I don’t comment about internal matters and I don’t comment on personnel matters. ... I mean we’re a private company, so why would we ... no.""

Taibbi's absence is only the latest in a series of shifts inside First Look, which Omidyar founded last year, originally in response to the disclosures of NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden to Greenwald and his Intercept colleague Laura Poitras. Omidyar initially committed $250 million to the project and began laying plans for a large general interest website and a number of more narrowly focused ""digital magazines."" In July, the billionaire announced he was scaling back the plan for the time being, choosing instead to focus on Racket and the Intercept as prototypes for a new technological model of journalism. The Intercept has lately been publishing vigorously, breaking several major stories — federal investigators are reportedly pursuing the alleged leaker responsible for a story on the site about the government's voluminous terrorist watch list. But Racket has been much slower to materialize, leading to rumors of staff anxiety.

In August, Temple told me Taibbi's site was experimenting with a variety of journalistic approaches — not just satire and humor but also investigative journalism. For instance, Ellen Miller, head of the campaign finance watchdog the Sunlight Foundation — a nonprofit also heavily financed by Omidyar — met with the staff over the summer to discuss how it might dig into issues of money in politics.

2219,"A British man who went to fight with the Kurds against Islamic State has claimed the terror group fed a desperate mother a meal of meat and rice before revealing she had eaten her own son. Yasir Abdulla, 36, from Yorkshire said that the woman had appealed to IS to release her son when they tricked her.

Adbulla told The Sun the woman was offered a seat at IS headquarters, then given a drink along with cooked meat and rice. At first she thought they were being generous, but when she finished the meal they revealed the cooked meat was the flesh of her son, whom they had murdered earlier.

Mr Adbulla said: “I hate IS because of what happened to an old Kurdish woman from a nearby tribe. Her son was captured by IS fighters and taken as a prisoner to Mosul.

“She was determined to find her son and went to IS headquarters and asked to see him. The IS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

“They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

“But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said, ‘You’ve just eaten him’.”

He added: “All the tribes are united against IS. They burn people alive, they chop off people’s heads, there is no limit to their depravity. They are not Muslims, they have hijacked Islam. All they do is hate.”

This is not the first report of horrific barbarism by the Islamic State, a group that have become famous for the gruesome treatment of their prisoners. In some cases they have beheaded them on camera, and in others they have burnt them alive.

The woman who ate her son has not been traced."
2220,"An unverified audio recording that may have captured the shooting of Michael Brown is being investigated by the FBI, according to a report.
News that a recording had surfaced was revealed on CNN, although the network said it had not independently confirmed that the alleged gunshots heard on the tape were from the shooting of the unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9.
In the recording, a man who has not been identified is heard speaking when a series of gunshots can be heard in the background. There is a quick pause and then another round of gunshots are fired. According to CNN, the man lives near where Brown was killed and was talking to a friend online at the time, which is how the ambient sound was recorded. The man didn’t realize what he had recorded initially and only later became aware it could be tied to the Brown case.
According to Lopa Blumenthal, the lawyer representing the man who made the recording, the tape could have “huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”"
2221,"MIAMI — The bulletin now falls squarely in the pantheon of unconfirmed phenomena, along with U.F.O.s, sightings of the Loch Ness monster and the breakup of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie:

Fidel Castro is dead.

Sooner or later, it will be true. But on Friday, for the umpteenth time, Miami was distracted by the rumor that Mr. Castro, 88, who has survived revolution, assassination attempts, countless cigars, substantial stress, a fall after leaving a stage and a life-threatening stomach ailment, had finally succumbed.

“Hope springs eternal,” said James Cason, the former head of the United States Interests Section in Cuba from 2002 to 2005 and now the mayor of Coral Gables, a wealthy enclave in Miami-Dade County. “He must have died 20 times since the time I went to Cuba.”

Cuban-Americans gathered in the usual spot, the Versailles restaurant on Calle Ocho, and other Cuban establishments to ponder the possibility that this time, maybe, maybe, it would be true. But even here in a city still fixated by Mr. Castro, rumor fatigue was obvious. Versailles had put its Fidel-is-dead game plan into action — assigning some parking spots to local TV and radio stations, but few showed up

It was no different at La Carreta, a restaurant in Westchester, Fla., a Cuban-American stronghold.

“There is always doubt about this; the joke is on us,” said Manolo Alvarez, 75, a retired painter, laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the Cuban cafecito counter. “But eventually it will happen. No one is immortal. And he will join the devil.”

Castro death alerts come fast and frequently these days. His age, ill health, long absence from public view and society’s shift from old-school rumor mill to hyperspeed Twitter feed make even debunked stories effortlessly spreadable. In fact, determining the provenance of each rumor has become a kind of modern-day parlor game.

In this case, the story probably stemmed from a simple mix-up, the death of a lesser-known namesake in a faraway country: Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, Raila Odinga, died on Sunday and was eulogized on Thursday. A similar mistake occurred in August 1997, when a Cuban revolutionary figure, Rene Orley Sanchez Castro, died in Cuba, spawning a swirl of speculation around the world.

Like most of the past false reports, the one on Friday was bolstered by tantalizing circumstantial droplets. The last time Mr. Castro was seen in public was Jan. 9, 2014, making Friday the first anniversary of his disappearance. And Mr. Castro, never at a loss for words, had failed to comment about December’s announcements by his younger brother, Raúl, and President Obama that the United States and Cuba would resume diplomatic ties.

There was also word on Friday of an abruptly scheduled news conference and chatter — true or not — about how the major roads to a famous revolutionary cemetery in Santiago de Cuba, where Mr. Castro reportedly will be buried, were being repaired.

The likeliest explanation for Mr. Castro’s absence is that he is, in fact, too mentally and physically frail to be seen or to speak.

“We don’t know what his physical state is because they never let you know,” Mr. Cason said of Cuban officials. “But they want him to be remembered as strong and vigorous. They don’t want him to be seen.”

Tales of Mr. Castro’s demise have surfaced for decades. In 1986, the State Department had to beat back a flurry of reports and questions from Miami about Mr. Castro’s apparent death. The sources of the speculation were varied and dubious: A ham radio operator in Havana, a nurse in Cuba who telephoned a friend in Miami, a report by an astrologer.

More rumors followed, off and on, and then accelerated after Mr. Castro vanished for a stretch in 2006 and, once again, after he relinquished power to his brother Raúl in 2008. Through the years, Mr. Castro has been rumored to have been stricken by heart attacks, brain hemorrhages, strokes and cancer. He has alternately delighted in and derided the many attempts to “kill him off early,” as he joked once in 1997.

“Now that our enemies have prematurely declared me dying or dead, I am happy to send my compatriots and friends around the world this short film material,” Mr. Castro said in 2006, after his absence.

In Miami, his death, when it is finally confirmed, will be historically momentous and, for most, cause for jubilation. The city will dust off its ever-evolving contingency plans. Even some private schools have early dismissal emails to parents at the ready.

But, to a certain extent, Mr. Castro’s death will also be anticlimactic. Years ago, his death was seen as the necessary prelude to a democratic Cuba and a return home for tens of thousands of exiles. With Raúl Castro firmly in place, that is no longer the case.

“If this had happened at the height of his power, or even when he was just fading, it would be different,” said Peter Hakim, a Cuba expert at the Inter-American Dialogue center in Washington. “This was almost a personal battle not to let Fidel win. Now, I think people are beginning to accept that Fidel has won. He will go to his grave with the government intact and the U.S. backing down from its unalterable commitment to unseat the regime he installed.”"
2223,"Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple’s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

“If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,” Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?"

2225,"LONDON — The North Korean embassy in London has denied  reports on Scottish media sites on Monday that it is planning to open an state-backed restaurant in Scotland.

""I think that is fabricated, it’s nonsense,"" a spokesman in the North Korean embassy in London told Mashable.

North Korea Leadership Watch's editor Michael Madden, who is a frequent visitor to the communist state, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

""It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland,"" he said, according to the Daily Record. ""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts. Despite voting 'no,' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

In September, Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of pro-North Korea newspaper Chonson Sinbo, told The Telegraph that North Korea has quietly endorsed Scottish independence.

""I believe that every person has the right to be a member of an independent nation, to have sovereignty, to live in peace and to enjoy equality,"" Choe said. ""And I believe that a majority of Scots feel the same and will vote for independence.""

North Korea has restaurants in parts of Asia as well as one branch in Amsterdam, which are used to funnel foreign currency back into the regime's treasury. The restaurants have existed for years in parts of China, while expansion to other parts of Asia began in the early 2000s.

But that didn't stop the sun baby watching over Teletubbyland from being accepted as part of the landscape, and that face has been part of so many childhood TV-watching memories for years.
And now, with the BBC reportedly planning on producing 60 new episodes of Teletubbies, the face is all grown up and coming forward!
Jess Smith, a university student from Edenbridge, Kent, (and not Jessica Smith, from Laguna Beach) has spoken out for the first time about being the one whose 9-month-old face was seen by millions through the years, first on the BBC and then in America on PBS.
According to London's Telegraph, Smith's big reveal came during a getting-to-know-you game during her first week at Canterbury Christ Church University, when the students were asked to tell something about themselves that no one would ever guess.
After spilling the sun baby beans, she the blond, blue-eyed teen revealed herself on Facebook.
""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.
""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it,"" she reportedly wrote. ""I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.
""Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.""

2228,"If you ever visit the Microsoft campus in the Silicon Valley and hear a mechanical voice shout ""Ex-ter-min-ate!"", don't be too spooked. It just means some geek humor has gone a little crazy.

Microsoft's campus in Silicon Valley will be patrolled by a team of five security guard robots from a company called Knightscope. The robot, dubbed K5, is five feet tall, weighs 300 pounds, and looks disturbingly like the Daleks of ""Doctor Who"" fame.

Fortunately, they are not armed with lasers. They use cameras and sensors to monitor their assigned area and look for suspicious activity. They are armed with high-definition cameras and audio recorders, able to record events and voices, analyze faces, read license plates, and even detect biological and chemical agents.

The K5s also use laser scanning and GPS for navigation, have weather sensors, and communicate via Wi-Fi. Their batteries run for about 24 hours and the K5 will return to a dock/power station to recharge.

Should they spot a problem, they call a human security guard. I'm just waiting for Knightscope to decide to cut out the middle man. Or for bored Microsofties to try and hack the thing to play pranks on people.

2230,"By Benjamin Kang Lim and Tony Munroe BEIJING/SEOUL, Oct 9 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power. North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3. The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises. ""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified. ""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing. Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred. If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said. ""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.  NOT KIM'S FIRST ABSENCE North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view. In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days. He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium. Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fueled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort."" Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumors of a coup were ""rubbish."" ""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a program for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centered on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago. However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition. Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped. ""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said. (Additional reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, who works at the airport in the city of St Petersburg in northwestern Russia, had finished his shift and was going home when he remembered he had left his keys at work.

According to news.com.au, he said: ""I returned back to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner. 

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict, and security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""


When officers arrived they also demanded he remove his belt, so Georgy then stripped off everything before walking through the scanner at St Petersburg Pulkovo airport.

He was then allowed to get dressed and leave, but later realised the video had been leaked and he'd become an online hit.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

According to the Mirror, a spokesman said: ""We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.""

2235,"Mediaite writes about CNN’s morning show questioning the reporting of one of CNN’s evening shows.

Monday night, “CNN Tonight” aired an audiotape purported to capture the shooting of Michael Brown. The tape was brought to CNN by St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal, (at right with anchor Don Lemon) who says a former client gave it to her. Lemon repeatedly said that CNN could not verify the authenticity of the tape.

TVNewser has learned CBS News received the same audio earlier this week from Blumenthal, but chose not to run it because it could not be verified.

This morning on “New Day,” two guests on CNN doubted the veracity of it.

“I’ve told your producers that for all I know this is something one of Howard Stern’s punk people had been doing. I look at this and my first inclination is someone is trying to punk CNN,” said former LAPD officer David Klinger. CNN analyst Tom Fuentes also doubted its authenticity: “When I heard this yesterday, I thought the exact same thing: it’s a hoax.”

WaPo’s Erik Wemple reported yesterday on how CNN got its hands on the audiotape. When asked about its authenticity, a CNN spokesperson told Wemple, “[W]e interviewed the caller’s attorney off camera and she answered key questions that gave us confidence to put her on the air live with Don. And we did confirm the caller lived close enough to the shooting to have heard the shots.”

Now it appears, there are doubts inside CNN."
2236,"Speculation is mounting that one of the senior Taliban detainees swapped for a US army prisoner of war has returned to militancy, following a leak to CNN.

No US official has yet confirmed the allegation, on or off the record. If true, it stands to plunge the Obama administration back into an acrimonious debate about its prisoner exchange for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl – and its long-frustrated aim of closing Guantánamo Bay.

CNN reported on Thursday that one of five Taliban members formerly held by the US at Guantánamo may have re-engaged in unspecified terrorist activity. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said in a statement he “cannot confirm or deny” the report.

Related: US soldier Bowe Bergdahl freed by Taliban in Afghanistan

A representative for the committee, Jack Langer, said classification restrictions would not permit additional detail on whether the Taliban member actually committed a terrorist or militant act, nor which ex-detainee is believed to be the subject of the speculation.

Langer also would not comment on when the committee learned of the allegation against the former detainee, but said that as part of the committee’s oversight responsibilities, it would scrutinize the issue.

So will the Senate armed services committee. “The committee is looking into the details of this issue,” said Dustin Walker, a spokesman, who could not confirm the allegation. He noted that panel chairman Senator John McCain “has expressed concern in the past about the potential for these prisoners to return to the fight”.

Mohammad Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Haq Wasiq, all detained at Guantánamo since the early days of the Afghanistan war, were placed under monitoring of the emir of Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl. They were not returned to Afghanistan, and are not believed to be there now.

The exact terms of the trade, which occurred in late May 2014, have not been disclosed, but the so-called Taliban Five were said to have been required to remain in Qatar for one year. The Obama administration has said from the start that assurances provided by the emir gave the US sufficient visibility into future activities and potential threats from the five men.

Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, said after the deal was finalized that “in all likelihood” the five ex-detainees “will not pose a national security risk”.

According to CNN, intercepted communications from the suspected detainee indicate he has reached out to his Taliban comrades to encourage additional attacks in a war in which the Obama administration has drawn down US forces. Approximately 10,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan, with residual counter-terrorism and training missions but said to be no longer taking part in major combat.

From the start, the Bergdahl swap drew criticism from congressional Republicans. Several contended that releasing the five senior Taliban from Afghanistan was a price too high for Bergdahl, whom the Taliban captured in 2009 following a murky decision Bergdahl apparently made to leave his unit’s base in eastern Afghanistan. House Republicans in particular blasted the US defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, for failing to notify them, as required by law, 30 days before the intended trade, which the administration indicated would have jeopardized the deal.

Related: US army denies reports it has decided to charge Bowe Bergdahl with desertion

While Bergdahl is now assigned to an army base in Texas, the army is investigating whether he should be charged with desertion. This week it batted back media reports that it had decided he would be.

McCain, himself a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam, has not criticized Bergdahl. But he said when the trade occurred that the senior Taliban were “big, high-level people, possibly responsible for the deaths of thousands”.

Nunes, in his statement, warned that if Obama continued with his intended transfers of detainees from Guantánamo, “there will be a steep price to pay – very likely in American lives”.

On Monday, the former administration envoy for closing Guantánamo underscored Obama’s intention to redouble efforts to shutter the controversial facility before his presidency ends, fulfilling a long-frustrated pledge. Additional transfers are expected in the coming weeks.Cliff Sloan, who left the State Department on 31 December, told the Guardian the administration was prioritizing the transfer of detainees already deemed by six agencies, including the military and intelligence leadership, not to pose significant national security risks."
2237,"It's not exactly legalization, but in New York City it could become the next best thing: tickets for marijuana possession instead of arrests.

According to a report on Sunday from The New York Times, the New York Police Department (NYPD) is planning to announce new guidelines that would allow those found in possession of small amounts of marijuana to walk away with a ticket instead of spending time in handcuffs.

The change in policy could have wide-ranging effects in a city known for arresting thousands citizens each year for marijuana possession.

If true, the change in policy could also have a significant impact on the city's black and Hispanic community, which some studies say are disproportionately affected by the police department's current marijuana arrest policy.

The upcoming shift in enforcement, which the report says is something of a throwback to the city's policy in the late '70s, comes just days after Alaska, Oregon and Washington D.C. voted to legalize cannabis, joining Colorado and Washington, events that may point toward a national trend.

2238,"Many of today’s modern customer service departments are notorious for leaving customers with anything but service. Phone calls lead to recorded run-arounds that resolve nothing while wasting the customer’s time. If a live customer service representative is actually reached, they may cheerily declare a customer’s problem solved, only for said customer to later find out that their problem is still alive and well. And sometimes companies have insulated themselves so well against customer complaints that the customer is simply left to pound sand.

But a company that will get you fired from your job for complaining to them? Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome, Comcast!

While definitely not Comcast’s first trip to the bad customer service rodeo, this latest case may trump all others, with Comcast getting a guy named Conal fired from his company following ongoing problems he was having with Comcast, reports the Consumerist.

Conal, an employee with a prominent accounting firm, received wrong products, extra products he didn’t request or need, wrong bills, and unwarranted bills – in other words a virtual blizzard of frustrating gaffes by Comcast that he could not get resolved through Comcast customer service. So, he went above their heads to the Comcast powers that be, including their controller.

An unforeseen conflict that Conal didn’t recognize, however, is that his company did business with Comcast. One of the higher ups at Comcast did see this though, and headed back over to Conal’s employer apparently intent on turning Conal’s complaints to Comcast against him.

This obviously influential Comcast executive had discussions about Conal with one of the partners in Conal’s company, and Conal got the boot shortly thereafter.

Conal says he’d only ever received positive reviews for his work, but the company claims he tried to use their name to get leverage in his dispute with Comcast. Conal maintains he did no such thing and can only surmise that someone from Comcast did some online sleuthing and figured out the connection with where he worked. This seemingly allowed Comcast to do some leveraging of their own to get Conal fired for daring to complain about their services.

In the end, Conal’s employer says they fired him based on an email from Comcast that gave an overview of Conal’s alleged wrongdoings via his interactions with Comcast employees.

Conal, meanwhile, says he’s never been allowed to see that email to check its veracity, and Comcast won’t release any documentation they have regarding his situation, either.

So, now stuck in a literal corporate nightmare, beneath both his own disloyal, former company and Comcast, Conal is left with little recourse, though he has retained a lawyer that has reportedly been in touch with Comcast.

The old adage about the customer always being right certainly doesn’t seem to hold any water in Conal’s dealings with Comcast.

But Business Insider reports that, as also mentioned above, Conal isn’t the first victim of Comcast’s alleged less-than-stellar customer service.

Below, please enjoy some of Comcast’s more well-known, documented, customer service fails.

The 71-years old priest, identified as, Father John Micheal O’neal, claims he went to heaven and met God, whom he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure. ‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting, she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. ‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!’ Despite the shocking revelation, which is being received with a bit of confusion in the Catholic world, Father O’neal says he still wishes to continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ‘Holy Mother’. ‘I wish to continue preaching.

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pickup truck, which now carries an anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

Subsequently, his company, Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pickup truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at its office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told the Galveston Daily News. “People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists. We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.”

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal from the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told the Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

It was chance that brought the two men together, when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, launched his attack as Corporal Nathan Cirillo, 25, stood guard at Ottawa’s war memorial, just metres away from the national parliament.

Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo dead before running into parliament, only to be killed himself by the Sergeant-at-Arms, Kevin Vickers.

Mr Vickers has been hailed as a hero after he dashed into his office to retrieve a hand gun before shooting Zehaf-Bibeau dead.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared the act a “terror attack” as he said that Canadians would not be intimidated by such actions.

The attack had particular potency, with Canada already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run earlier in the week against two Canadian soldiers by Muslim convert Martin Rouleau-Couture.

Corporal Cirillo’s aunt has described him as a “wonderful young man,” who joined the cadets in his hometown of Hamilton as an adolescent, and went on to enlist with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.

In a cruel twist, he was carrying out a short rotation of just one month as a guard at the war memorial. The position was created seven years ago after a string of vandalism attempts.

The National War Memorial, which includes the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, honours Canadians who died for their country.

“He was a wonderful young man. Not an enemy in the world,” Cpl. Cirillo’s aunt, told the Globe and Mail newspaper

She said her nephew was devoted to his six-year-old son, and spent almost all of his spare time with his family, and working out, she said. “He was into being fit. And being a father and a son.”

Zehaf-Bibeau, on the other hand, had a criminal record in Quebec and British Columbia. The son of a Libyan mother and Quebecoise mother, he has convictions for drug possession and robbery.

He was recently designated a “high risk traveller” by the Canadian government, and his passport was seized.

OTTAWA: Ottawa attacker on terror watchlist

His mother Susan is the deputy chairman of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Radio Canada has reported.

Police said in the initial hours after the shootings that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part. But as the day wore on, the cordon around Parliament was eased, employees were allowed to go home, and the sense of urgency appeared to wane.

“Today is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,” Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said. He said it was a tragedy with “origins as yet not fully known, causes not yet fully understood.”

Witnesses said Corporal Cirillo was gunned down at point-blank range just before 10 am by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, his face half-covered. They said the gunman appeared to raise his arms in triumph, then ran off and entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out.

DEFENCE: ADF chief warns against complacency

People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside and barricaded doors with chairs as police with rifles and body armour took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament.

Video footage posted online by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police ducking for cover as they advanced along a stone hallway, loud gunfire echoing among parliament’s stone columns.

Reporters in Canada said that if the gunman had turned left as he ran into the building, he would have entered the room where a caucus meeting was being held.

Colonel Geordie Elms, a former commanding officer of the Argylls, told The Globe and Mail that his “heart just fell” when he saw the regiment’s distinctive gold leopard badge on the shot soldier on television broadcasts. “That could only be one unit,” he said he thought at the time.

Because the guard role is considered ceremonial, Mr Cirillo’s gun probably was not loaded, he said.

Hamilton Mayor Bob Bratina told the newspaper he had visited Corpl Cirillo’s family, who had told him that he was excited to be a part of the army.

“He was so proud of it,” he said, “and looked really great wearing the Argylls kit.”

""I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,"" Hunter claimed. ""There's nobody talking about it.""

""If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,"" he continued.

One source close to Hunter worked to walk back the comment, emphasizing that the congressman received a tip from a “high level” source at U.S. Customs and Border Protection who told him that a group of people with “suspected ISIS affiliation” –- even Americans who traveled to Syria to fight with the Free Syrian Army against President Bashar al-Assad –- were apprehended at the border.

The tip ""was from a confidential source with the Border Patrol,"" the source said in an email. ""[It’s] more accurate to say people with known associations. Not 'fighters' in the sense folks might immediately think.""

While DHS and several other congressional sources shot down the claim outright, a spokesman for Hunter said that the congressman fears ISIS sympathizers could easily melt into U.S. cities and breed home-grown terrorism.

“The Congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,” Joe Kasper, deputy chief of staff to Hunter, wrote in response to the DHS denial. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Customs and Border Protection is part of DHS.

Hunter’s office declined an ABC News request to interview the congressman.

2250,"The FBI has allegedly interviewed a man whose video chat with a friend picked up audio of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown, the individual’s lawyer tells CNN. What attorney Lopa Blumenthal claims is the sound of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson firing at the unarmed 18-year-old can be heard in two distinct bursts — at least six shots, a pause, and an additional four shots, according to a forensic audio expert — in the ten-second clip.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” says a lawyer who has previously represented the family of a police shooting victim.

(The foreground of the audio is a bit distracting. “You are pretty. You’re so fine. Just going on some of your videos. Okay, yeah,” says a man’s voice. As CNN’s Don Lemon put it, “Your client, uh, was having a video chat. With a friend. Doing normal … whatever you do.”)

Brown’s friend Dorian Johnson, who witnessed the shooting, has said Brown was shot first while struggling with Officer Wilson, and then again after running away as he turned back with his hands up. However, “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well, I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again,’” offered CNN host and attorney Van Jones.

An autopsy commissioned by Brown’s family found that the teenager was shot at least six times, four times in the right arm and twice in the head, all in the front."
2251,"HAVANA (AP) — Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castrowas last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning.

2256,"New footage of the elusive yeti, captured amid the snowfields of Russia, is sparking renewed debate about the creature’s existence, as some see definitive proof while others claim the video is nothing more than a publicity stunt.

A group of Russian researchers set out after the yeti, traveling to the south-western Adygeya Republic after local news detailed sightings of the creature, according to the Daily Mail. The yeti had reportedly been spotted just an hour’s drive away from the city of Adygeisk. After arriving in the area, the team interviewed witnesses at a local mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen the yeti.

“I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house,” local witness Andrei Kazarian recalled. “Although we didn’t see anyone, we saw its huge footprints. They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.”

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova described the yeti as bearlike, though markedly different.

“The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.”

Setting out to investigate, the group were stunned to hear crunching snow, before spotting the yeti moving through the trees. As the Mirror reports, they claim to have then captured footage of the yeti, evidence that has since been handed over to local scientists for analysis.

The yeti video has already proven to be controversial, with some observers claiming that the sighting is nothing more than a stunt designed to bring tourists into the Russian town. Others, however, have asserted that the clip represents genuine proof of the yeti’s existence.

Last year, a DNA study conducted by Oxford professor Bryan Sykes failed to identify definitive proof of the yeti from hair samples. As the Inquisitr previously reported, however, Sykes was quick to assert that the study was meant to systematically examine yeti evidence, not pass judgement on its existence.

Hairy human-like beasts have been reported the world over, most famously in the United States, where the creatures are known as Bigfoot (or Sasquatch). In Russia, they are called either Almas or Yeti, names which may denote two distinct species.

2257,"(Reuters) - Historians on Thursday opened up a 113-year-old time capsule that had been hidden in a statue of a lion atop Boston's Old State House, and discovered a small red hardcover book tucked inside a copper box.

The book was not opened immediately due to its age and its contents were still unclear, but Bostonian Society President Brian LeMay pronounced himself ""absolutely thrilled"" by the find, which was not expected.

A Boston Daily Globe article from 1901, the year the capsule was placed in the statue atop the 301-year-old building, had described its contents as including letters from elected officials and buttons from the presidential campaigns of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

2260,"A humorous report on a satirical Web site done in the style of China's state broadcaster CCTV offers advice to Chinese on how to choose their English names. ""English names come with different connotations. It’s not always fair to those people, but they do,"" the article warns. ""A name can come with a ‘feeling’ or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from.""

The adoption of unconventional English names in China and other parts of East Asia is the source of perennial fascination and mirth among expats. Any young Anglophone who teaches English in the region could rattle off a host of perplexing names he or she had to call out during class.

One friend of WorldViews who taught English and civics in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou had a number of students whose chosen English names were derived from screen names used during online computer games. There was Orcapm, who was not to be outdone by Skycoolz.

""Sure, have fun and pick a random object or word as a name, but avoid them if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America,"" the post chides. It offers this guide:

A good way to work out the ‘feeling’ of a name is to watch a bunch of American movies and sitcoms. They’re full of name stereotypes — you’ll find the good girls’ are all ‘Jane’s, the jock boys’ are still ‘Buds’ and the geeks’ are called ‘Sheldon’.

The report also lays out a set of rules governing the types of English names typically adopted by Chinese. Be careful about what may sound inappropriate alongside common Chinese family names such as Wang or Dong. In general, it's good to avoid food as a name, it suggests.

To put bluntly, names like Candy, Lolly, Sugar (think anything sweet), are typically thought of as ‘non-smart girl’ names, or ‘stripper’ names.

It’s not always right; there are doubtless some very smart Candy’s out there. But it’s the first thing that comes to mind.

Other instructions include eschewing the names of famous leaders or celebrities. ""Pick any name like Obama, Einstein or Madonna and you’re going to get some stares,"" it says. ""You have some pretty big shoes to fill there.""

At a McDonald's restaurant in Hong Kong, WorldViews once was served by an employee whose badge confusingly read ""Franco Mussolini."" One hopes he didn't harbor similar dreams of power and domination.

While it's easy to make fun of such unusual naming conventions, it's also hard not to appreciate the playfulness with which these names get chosen. Often, Chinese people pick an English name as a play of words based on their original given Chinese name. The Atlantic offers a few examples from the Cantonese-speaking city of Hong Kong:

Many English names mimic the sound of Chinese given names. A solicitor called Tse Kar-son, for example, has Carson as his English name. Singer Lee Hak-kan's English name is Hacken. Another singer, Chan Yik-shun, is called Eason...

Ho Wai-leuk, a journalist, got his name another way. ""When I was a student, everyone kept saying my Chinese name really fast until it started sounding like 'hoh lok,'"" he said referring to the Cantonese pronunciation for Coca-Cola, ""so Cola stuck.""

For most people, our names are our names and we have little choice in the matter. But the practice of adopting a new English name can be seen as an exercise in self-expression, especially in societies where larger trends of conformity hold some sway.

Who wouldn't want to be able to re-brand themselves or be able to highlight some unique part of their identity? Just don't use that power to call yourself ""Bunny Wang,"" the post says.

Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that the original post was from CCTV. It was, in fact, by a satirical news site."

Say What? ‘At Least Ten ISIS Fighters Have Been Caught Coming Across the Border’

Rep. Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, does not seem like a nut job or prone to wild exaggerations. But last night he said something that should make jaws drop:

Van Susteren: Hold on. Stop for one second.

Hunter: They are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.

Van Susteren: Let me ask a question. You say that they are coming in the southern border, which changes all the dynamics Do you have any information that they are coming in through the southern border now?

Hunter: Yes.

Van Susteren: Tell me what you know.

Hunter: At least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the border in Texas.

Van Susteren: How do you know that?

Hunter: Because I’ve asked the border patrol, Greta.

Van Susteren: And the border patrol just let’s ISIS members come across the border?

Hunter: No. They caught them at the border. Therefore, we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them, you know that there are going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol. That’s how you know. That’s where we are at risk here, is from ISIS and radical Islamists coming across the border. Once again, they don’t have a navy, air force, nuclear weapons. The only way that Americans are going to be harmed by radical Islam — Chairman Dempsey said the same thing. He said that’s where the major threat is here, that’s how these guys are going to infiltrate through America and harm Americans.

Then add this comment by a House Democrat:

Rep. Tim Bishop (D., N.Y.) warned during a recent speech that up to 40 radicalized U.S. citizens who have fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL or ISIS) have already returned to the United States, where they could pose a terrorist threat.

Bishop claims that of the 100 or so Americans who have traveled to the Middle East to join ISIL’s ranks, some 40 have returned and are currently being surveilled by the FBI, according to his remarks, which were filmed and uploaded to YouTube last week.

“One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,” Bishop said during the speech. “It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.”

“It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country,” Bishop said, eliciting shocked responses from some in the crowd.

Is the threat of ISIS terrorists crossing our southern border no longer theoretical? Could the administration really successfully cover up something as big as this?"

The rocks, taken from a crater left by the impact in the eastern part of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on Saturday, were not from the meteorite, but some could contain material left behind by the space body, commission member Wilfred Strauch told reporters at a press conference.

""Researchers will be collecting more samples of rocks and nearby trees"" for analysis, Strauch said.

Strauch, who works for the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (Ineter), said researchers were seeking international help to figure out what caused the explosion on Sept. 6.

The Nicaraguan government announced on Sunday that a loud explosion that frightened residents could have come from a meteorite that fell near Managua's international airport. A crater measuring 12 meters across was left on the ground.

The incident coincided with the passing of a small asteroid, the 2014 RC, near the Earth on the same day.

Also on Tuesday, an expert with the U.S. space agency NASA, Don Yeomans, said it was unlikely that a piece of rock had separated from the asteroid as it whooshed past the Earth.

NASA experts also said the fact that no local residents reported seeing a fireball in the sky prior to the crash means it was not a meteorite.

Strauch said those observations were ""very interesting and important,"" adding Nicaragua will invite experts from NASA and other countries, such as Uruguay, to spend a month investigations at the site."
2265,"In further trouble for Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, Punjab and Haryana High Court has ordered a CBI probe into the allegations of forced castration of his followers inside the ashram. Justice K Kannan of the High Court passed the order on a petition filed by Hansraj Chauhan, a former follower of the Dera.

In his petition, Chauhan had claimed that he along with around 400 saints of 'dera' were castrated inside the ashram, Chauhan's counsel Navkiran Singh said.

Chauhan said in the petition that they were assured that those who would get castrated will be able to meet God through the dera head.

Taking cognizance of the petition, the HC had earlier ordered medical examination of petitioner Chuahan from the government multi-specialty hospital (GMSH) at Sector-16, Chandigarh.

The GMSH authorities examined Chauhan and found that he has been castrated, Singh said.

Seeking a CBI probe, Chauhan has also claimed before the High Court that castration process of dera followers is being done by Gurmeet Ram Rahim through doctors are employed in his hospital.

Besides, in a report submitted before the High Court, the state government said that it has recorded the statements of seven persons, associated with the dera head, in which all of them have confirmed that they have been castrated, Singh said.

The dera chief, who is going to hit the big screen next month with his film 'Messenger of God (MSG)', has already courted controversy with Sikh organisations, including Akal Takht, seeking a ban on it.

He has not only played the lead role in the movie but also produced it and sang songs.

""If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border -- it’s that simple,"" he said.

""ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border -- which they already have.""

Two of the country's top intelligence officials said last month they had no credible evidence to support the theory that militants are operating next door, nor that they are plotting to sneak across the border.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that Hunter's claim otherwise was ""categorically false.""

""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told The Huffington Post. ""DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""

Hunter, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, isn't the first member of Congress to raise the alarm about the prospect of extremists crossing the border. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested last month that such infiltration was possible, and Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said it was already happening. Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has also sounded similar notes about terrorists crossing his state's border from Mexico. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Arkansas, claimed Tuesday that extremists were actively collaborating with Mexican drug cartels to infiltrate the U.S. border and attack Arkansans.

Asked for comment on Wednesday, a spokesman for Hunter said the information came for a ""high level source"" and that DHS was ""actively discouraging any talk of IS on the border.""

""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"" Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper told The Huffington Post.

2267,"Nearly killed by Taliban sniper

With all the bad news coming out of Syria, Iraq, and the Ukraine, it’s easy to forget that the United States still has thousands of troops on the ground in Afghanistan. While a new combat theater has opened up in the Levant, the fight to vanquish the Taliban and the remnants of the Afghan insurgency rolls on as the longest war in American history finally winds down.

Just last year, one Marine team was conducting a “joint helicopter raid” in Helmand Province when they crossed the sights of a Taliban sniper. The phrase “my life flashed before my eyes” has been used and abused in our culture, but when one of these men kneels down to inspect the hole in his Kevlar helmet, he embodies that feeling.

The Iraqi government had said she was not married to the Islamist leader.

Machnouk claims al-Dulaimi is pregnant but the child is not al-Baghdadi’s.

“We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [al-Baghdadi’s] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,” Machnouk told MTV.

2271,"French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be ""lucky"" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015. Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015."
2272,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — The leader of Boko Haram has denied agreeing to any cease-fire with the Nigerian government, and said he married off the more than 200 schoolgirls that the Islamic extremist group kidnapped.

In a new video released late Friday night, Abubakar Shekau dashed hopes for a prisoner exchange to get the girls released.

""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he said, laughing. ""In this war, there is no going back.""

Nigeria's chief of defense staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, on Oct. 17 announced that Boko Haram had agreed to an immediate cease-fire to end a 5-year-old insurgency that has killed thousands of people, and driven hundreds of thousands from their homes in northeast Nigeria.

But attacks and abductions have continued, with the extremists this week seizing Mubi, a town of more than 200,000 people. Fighting also continued Friday in Vimtin, the nearby village where Badeh was born.

Shekau in August announced that Boko Haram wanted to establish an Islamic caliphate, along the lines of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Fleeing residents have reported that hundreds of people are being detained for infractions of the extremists' version of strict Shariah law in several towns and villages under their control.

Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls taking exams at a boarding school in the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April prompted an international campaign for their release and criticism of Nigeria's government for not acting quickly to free them. Dozens of the girls escaped on their own in the first few days, but 219 remain missing. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls has been used on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, in an effort to spark conversation about the kidnappings. Nobel Peace Prize laureate and international education activist Malala Yousafzai visited Nigeria in July, and urged Boko Haram to free the kidnapped girls, calling them her ""sisters.""

Unconfirmed reports have indicated that the girls have been broken up into several groups, and that some may have been carried across borders into Cameroon and Chad.

The government had said it had negotiated with two Boko Haram leaders in Chad, with talks hosted by President Idriss Deby, and that it was confident the girls would be freed soon. But Boko Haram has many factions.

Shekau's announcement further discredits the government of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who on Thursday formally announced his candidacy for elections on Feb. 14, 2015, in Africa's most populous nation. Nigeria, with some 160 million people, is divided almost equally between Muslims who dominate the north and Christians in the south. The West African nation is the biggest oil producer on the continent and has its biggest economy.

Jonathan's failure to curtail the insurgency and many corruption scandals are not expected to dim his chances of success. The election, though, is expected to be the most hotly contested since his People's Democratic Party took power after decades of military dictatorship ended in 1994.

Dozens of ruling party legislators have defected to the coalition All Progressives Congress, losing the PDP its majority in the lower house of Parliament. But the coalition is weakened by its inability to choose a presidential candidate, and primaries in December will be contested by three powerful northerners who all are Muslim.

Jonathan, a Christian from a minority southern tribe, has been criticized for ignoring an unwritten party rule to alternate power between Christian and Muslim leaders, adding a religious and ethnic dimension to the election.

2273,"When Tim Cook unveiled the Apple Watch back in September, its official launch date was set as the oh-so-vague “Spring 2015.” Now, we have our first guess as to what that launch date could actually look like. 9to5Mac reports that the Apple Watch is set to ship in the U.S. by the end of March, with Apple Store retail training scheduled for mid February.

According to the report, Apple will be sending representatives from Apple Stores to Apple’s offices in Cupertino or Austin, Texas to learn about the Watch, which will better prepare store employees for when the Watch arrives. In addition, the report states that Apple is finishing up work on the Apple Watch’s software, battery life, and inductive charging mechanism.

No word if every version of the Watch will ship in March, and of course these dates could change, as we get closer to launch. But for now, I’m imagining the rose gold Watch Edition sitting (maybe not so) delicately on my left wrist. The basic Watch will start at $349."

2275,"When Apple released the first iPhone, it only came with Apple's pre-loaded applications.

A year later, Apple opened the ""App Store"", which allowed developers to make applications for the iPhone.

The App Store is probably the smartest thing Apple did for the iPhone. It created a rich ecosystem of applications that made the phone an indispensable tool for hundreds of millions of people. It also launched billions of dollars worth of new businesses. (Think Instagram, Uber, Snapchat, etc.)

With the Apple set to release an Apple Watch, a lot of people expect a similar thing is going to happen with third-party applications from developers.

Developers we've spoken with caution that people should temper expectations, at least initially. They say Apple is limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing early on in order to ensure a smooth launch and maintain battery life.

""I think Apple is taking a similar approach with the Apple Watch and iPhone, saying to themselves 'We don't have an option to fail on this,'"" Sumit Mehra, CTO of app studio Y Media Labs told Business Insider. ""So Apple is limiting all this nice stuff, all these sensors, NFC, haptics, heartbeat sensor, gyrometer — everything. Apple is only going to allow developers to do the basic stuff to just get the Apple Watch out there, because either it's not ready, or they don't know what the implications of something like this could be.""

Mehra says he thinks it all boils down the Apple's continued efforts to increase the battery life of the Apple Watch. Accessing sensors drains the battery life, so Apple is preventing developers from using these sensors in their apps to avoid launching a device with a lineup full of battery-hogging apps.

""Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don’t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it’s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours.""

Apple currently doesn't allow developers to create standalone apps for the Apple Watch, though Apple has promised it will open up WatchKit later this year. For now, apps offload all the heavy lifting and computations to the tethered iPhone, which saves battery and gives developers access to the iPhone's powerful processor.

What can Apple Watch apps do at this very moment? They can send actionable notifications, talk to your iPhone through app extensions, and present summary information in what Apple is calling ""glances.""

Markiyan Matsekh, who has been developing a third-party Tesla companion app for the Apple Watch at app-company Eleks, says the limitations have presented a challenge for developers.

""The general impression I’d say is that the Apple Watch didn’t match the expectations,"" Matsekh told Business Insider. ""We saw lots of fun stuff during the Apple Watch’s presentation, and in its description and marketing materials, but we didn’t find a way to implement them in real life. We had a vision of what we’d like to achieve, and in the end we had to get rid of lots of features because they just weren’t possible in the current state of WatchKit.""

Matsekh says the Eleks team was eventually able to create an app that was ""more or less fine,"" but says the current limitations mean ""it’s not as cool as we’d like it be.""

""It is possible to build something, but it’s much more limited than we’d expect,"" he says.

Matsekh originally wanted to use the Apple Watch's digital crown, the circular knob used as input on the watch, as a way for users to control the interior temperature of their Tesla. Apple's guidelines, however, state that you can only use the digital crown for scrolling or system features, so they had to scrap that and go with a second-best solution.

""What I think Apple is trying to do is to educate Apple Watch users of some basic user experience guidelines to try to make it as simple as possible,"" Matsekh says. ""That may have been the reason behind this. It’s not that they didn’t have the time or resources to make these features available, I think it was a conscious choice to limit customization to make the apps follow the guidelines and make them simpler for users.""

""Any engineer would say that Apple is just trying to conserve battery life so that the user has a good experience,"" Y Media Labs CTO Sumit Mehra says. ""As a developer, do I like it? Probably not. But do I like it as a user? Absolutely, because at the end of the day I don’t want to be charging my watch twice a day.""

It's no secret that battery life is still a major concern for app developers, and nobody knows how long the Apple Watch will last before it needs a charge. Developers are estimating between 19 and 24 hours, but Apple has yet to announce specifics.

For Matsekh, one thing is for certain: ""If this watch doesn’t live a day, it doesn’t have any chance of survival."""
2276,"First customers complained that their new iPhone 6s were bending.

Now owners of the new Apple gadget have said when they make a phone call - it is ripping out their hair.

The new controversy, branded by social media users as 'hairgate', follows allegations people are getting their beard or head hair 'snagged' when the phone is held against their face.

Claims: Chad Coleman was one of the first people to raise the issue on Twitter after complaining that his 'scruff' was being ripped

Anger: Scott Bilsky blamed the seam where the aluminium meets the glass on his hair being pulled out

Scandal: Hairgate is the latest controversy following bendgate - where users said the phone was bending when it was placed in a skinny jeans pocket or sat on

They claim that the seam between the aluminium and glass screen is catching hairs and tearing them out.

It is the latest scandal, following on from 'bendgate', and has led to a flurry of angry posts on Twitter.

Chad Coleman said: 'Anyone else getting beard hairs pulled by the iPhone 6/Plus? It catches my scruff in the seam and yanks it when I make calls.'

Paul Peavler said: 'The seam on my iPhone where the aluminium meets the glass is definitely catching my hair and pulling it out.

The new allegations have also prompted a number of hoax adverts, suggesting the phone is good for shaving a woman's legs and trimming a man's facial hair.

Others have said the phone 'has it all' and can save you money on going to the hairdressers.

Earlier this month, the electronics giant were forced to respond to complaints the phones were bending.

Response: The latest complaint led to some creating mock adverts, one was as a beard trimmer for men

Smooth: Another involved a woman apparently shaving her legs using the iPhone 6

Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus.'

The new phones face criticism over their bendability, dubbed 'bendgate.' Social media and online forums have been filled with comments about how the new phones can bend when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans.

Apple said its iPhones feature stainless steel and titanium inserts to reinforce high-stress locations and use the strongest glass in the smartphone industry.

The only way an iPhone may have bent is if someone put it in their back pocket and sat on the phone for a very long time, said Laban Roomes, chief executive officer of Goldgenie, which customizes and gold plates iPhones.

Problem: Paul Peavler, blaming the design of the phone for the issue, referred to the problem as 'seamgate'

Attribute: Mo Jiwa put a positive spin on the newest perceived flaw saying the iPhone 6 is now the phone that 'does it all'

2277,"Apple took the leap into the wearable space with the announcement of its Apple Watch earlier in September this year, revealing that the device will start at $349. Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known."

2280,"Mark Oberholtzer isn't an Islamic fighter in Syria. He's never been to Syria. And the plumber from Texas City, Texas, says he certainly would never willingly aid fundamentalist rebels.

So it's hard for him to understand how his Ford F-250 pickup truck - including his logo for Mark-1 Plumbing and his phone number - wound up being in a photo posted on Twitter by the extremist Ansar al-Deen Front from the front lines of the war in Syria.

Mr Oberholtzer says he's been getting hundreds of phone calls and faxes since the Ansar al-Deen Front tweeted a picture of what appeared to be his old truck with an anti-aircraft gun in the back, according to the Galveston County Daily News.

However, it remains to be seen if the photo is entirely authentic, with a new video surfacing which suggests the photo could have been digitally altered.

Scroll down for video

This truck, once owned by Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City, Texas, is seen here in an Islamist propaganda photo. It's unclear if it has gone all the way to Syria or whether the photo has been digitally altered

This photo, taken from a propaganda video, shows a near identical scene featuring a different truck, raising questions as to the authenticity of the photo featuring Mr Oberholtzer's truck

The Islamist forces fighting across the region are known for their advanced and technical digital propaganda campaigns.

The video, featuring a different vehicle firing from exactly the same position, raises the possibility Mr Oberholtzer's vehicle may have been photoshopped into a video frame.

Superimposing a better vehicle and gun into a still frame from the original video would be significantly easier than trying to alter the video itself.

This could be why the video features an older model car and weapon, but the photo features Mr Oberholtzer's later-model Toyota.

Despite this, people have now been making hateful phone calls to Mr Oberholtzer's company in the mistaken belief he is supporting the fundamentalists.

'A few of the people are really ugly,' he told the newspaper.

Some threatened his life.

Mr Oberholtzer says he has hired a lawyer and wants to make Twitter remove the posting, CBS News reports.

He says he sold the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago.

In the past when he sold his work trucks, he always removed the logo first. The last time he got rid of a vehicle he didn't.

Mark Oberholtzer says he has no idea how Islamists in Syria could have got hold of his truck

Mr Oberholtzer, who has worked as a plumber for the past 32-years, assumed AutoNation would remove the decal before selling the truck.

Apparently it didn't.

It's still unknown how the truck could have made its way into the possession of Islamist fighters in Syria.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction, and probably different owners over and over, before it may have ended up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

Oberholtzer wants the death threats and the phone to stop ringing.

'We have a secretary here, she's scared to death. We all have families. We don't want no problems,' said Oberholtzer.

CBS News reports that the band of Ansar al-Deen seen in the photo mostly hail from Chechnya in Russia.

While most fighters are Islamic extremists, the group has not reportedly allied itself with ISIS in Syria.

ISIS: The terror group has expanded how and why it recruits new members and is specifically targeting sympathizers abroad

And while it is not known how fighters with ISIS could have come to own a Texan plumber's truck, the terror group is trying to expand how it recruits fighters to its ranks.

The extremist organization also has been targeting its sophisticated propaganda to entice potential wives and professionals such as doctors, accountants and engineers in its efforts to build a new society.

Among those it has lured were three teenage girls from Colorado, who set out for Syria this fall after swapping Twitter messages about marriage and religion with IS recruiters, and a young woman who sought to fight there - or failing that, to use her nursing skills. It's a diverse pool of recruits whose motives perplex Western governments seeking to combat the flow.

The group 'is issuing a bit of a siren song through social media, trying to attract people to their so-called caliphate,' FBI Director James Comey told reporters. 'And among the people they're trying to attract are young women to be brides for these jihadis.'

The group conscripts children for battle, recruits Westerners for acts of jihad and releases videotapes of beheadings. But it also uses propaganda with a humanitarian appeal, such as photos of bombed-out Syrian villages coupled with pleas for help. Video images of smiling children being given treats and enjoying stuffed animals paint a family-friendly portrait that suggests roles within the proto-state for wives and mothers.

Justice Department officials say people aiding the Islamic State understand what they're getting into and risk prosecution, whether or not they venture to Syria and even if they don't plan to take up arms themselves. Prosecutors have criminally charged more than 15 people in connection with supporting Islamic militant groups.

Advance: Militant Islamist fighters wave flags as they take part in a military parade along the streets of Syria's northern Raqqa province in June

A Rochester, New York, food store owner stands accused of trying to arrange for others to travel to Syria and of plotting to kill members of the U.S. military. An Illinois man, allegedly determined to join militants, left behind a letter saying he was disgusted by Western society. And prosecutors say a North Carolina man asked Allah online for martyrdom.

Most charges are brought under a statute that makes it illegal to provide 'material support' - including money, training or a false identity - to a designated terrorist group. Defense lawyers argued the law is overly broad and ensnares the misguided as often as it sweeps up the dangerous. Courts, however, have accepted an expansive interpretation of the law.

'We need to make clear that if you want to go over there and join a terrorist group, you're likely to end up instead in jail,' Carlin said.

Justice Department officials say they're also trying strategies other than prosecution, including trying to identify potential recruits before they go.

FBI agents in Colorado met repeatedly with Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old nurse's aide who had converted to Islam, hoping to dissuade her from traveling to Syria to marry a militant suitor she met online. Agents suggested she try humanitarian work instead of jihad, but she told them that if she couldn't fight, she would use her skills as a nurse's aide to help militant fighters, according to court documents.

Conley pleaded guilty in September and faces sentencing next month. Her lawyer, Robert Pepin, has said she was 'led terribly astray' while pursuing her religion and was 'saved' by her arrest.

Perhaps no case better shows the penetration of the recruitment campaign than that of the three Colorado girls, all from East African immigrant families, who were radicalized online and headed for Syria in October.

The self-styled 'caliphate' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain

A review of the girls' social media use, which included thousands of Twitter messages and postings on other sites, by the SITE Intelligence Group shows they were in contact with online jihadists from around the world and were deeply interested in marriage and the role of women. As recruiters interacted with the girls, their typical teenage banter about friends and school became replaced with discussions of religion, paradise and death, the review showed.

Six months before they went overseas, one girl wrote that she wanted to get married as soon as possible and her friends wished her well, telling her they hoped she got an 'amazing husband because you do not deserve anything else!'

One female recruiter told prospects to expect to marry quickly and expect to live a domestic life, as it is 'completely impossible for women to participate in battle,' according to SITE. Women are expected to marry the fighters and bear their children, she explained. Another recruiter told a 16-year-old girl who inquired about joining that 'everyone is welcome,' according to the report.

U.S. officials say even comparatively benign motives for supporting the Islamic State are troubling. 'I'm not sure we've seen someone who's gone over there who's not attracted to the jihadi cause,' Carlin said."

2283,"Wanted: Islamic State group chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has a $US10 million price on his head, delivers a sermon at a mosque in Iraq in July. Photo: AP

Beirut: The second wife of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is under interrogation in military detention in Lebanon after she was arrested in the north of Lebanon 10 days ago, security officials revealed on Tuesday.

It is unclear whether she was fleeing the self-proclaimed caliph of the extremist Sunni group, or if she remains loyal to Baghdadi and was simply in hiding, experts said.

Working with Western intelligence services, the Lebanese army tracked Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi citizen, and her son to an undisclosed location north of the strife-ridden city of Tripoli, one official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said. Another source said she was captured in the northern border town of Arsal.

Her capture and detention could prove to be a significant setback for Baghdadi as she may be used as leverage to negotiate the release of the many prisoners – both foreign, Iraqi and Syrian – that the Islamic State is holding.

Lebanese security officials also hope her capture could be the breakthrough needed to secure the release of at least 26 Lebanese soldiers kidnapped by IS and Nusra Front militants in August.

A DNA test had confirmed the child, believed to be nine years old, is Baghdadi's son, the Lebanese al-Safir newspaper said, citing security officials.

It is believed Baghdadi's DNA may have been taken by US officials during the nine months he was held in an American-run prison in Iraq in 2004 after his capture in Fallujah

However in a sign of the confusion surrounding the arrests, some media sources reported the child in custody was a girl.

Dulaimi was one of 140 women released from a Syrian government jail in March this year as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Greek Orthodox nuns held by al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front in the Syrian town of Maaloula.

Since her release she is believed to have moved around the border area between Lebanon and Syria, sticking mostly to the mountainous territory held by the Nusra Front, said Mario Abou Zeid, a research analyst with the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut.  ""She was infiltrating the Lebanese borders, moving inside and outside Lebanon with fake IDs … in the area controlled by Nusra Front,"" Mr Abou Zeid said. ""She maintained a very low profile, protecting herself and her son.""  He warned that Dulaimi's capture, while an important step, may be of limited value to intelligence services given the Islamic State was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle.  ""The main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to.  ""Some may think she has all the secrets of Baghdadi, even though she was captured in the Syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from Baghdadi, on the run along the Lebanese-Syrian border.""  It is possible Dulaimi had been away from Baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to Lebanon ""could have been a defection from Baghdadi, she could have been fleeing"", Mr Abou Zeid told Fairfax Media.  She is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the Lebanese defence ministry in the Yarze district, north of Beirut, the unnamed official said.  There is no doubt the counter-terrorism operation, which involved both Lebanese, US and European intelligence agencies, will prove useful, said retired Lebanese general and security analyst, Elias Farhat.  ""She is one of the wives of the so-called caliph of the Islamic State … she will be useful in the negotiations between the Lebanese authorities as IS and Jabhat al-Nusra in relation to the kidnapped soldiers,"" General Farhat said.  ""Her capture is one of the successful outcomes of cooperation between Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies.""  But even as news of Dulaimi's capture broke over Lebanon, local media reported late on Tuesday that militants had attacked a Lebanese army patrol in Ras Baalbek, with a four-man unit feared harmed or kidnapped.  It is believed Baghdadi became head of the Islamic State of Iraq, a predecessor to IS, in 2010. It then expanded into Syria in 2013 and in June Islamic State militants took control of Iraq's second city of Mosul before moving south towards the capital.  There were reports last month that he had been killed in US-led airstrikes in Iraq, although soon after the Islamic State released a recording on November 13 – purportedly by Baghdadi – in which he called for ""volcanos of jihad"" to be unleashed over the world.

This new audio also matches up with the statements made by Piaget Crenshaw and Tiffany Mitchell. And while it doesn't necessarily confirm everything they've said, it certainly adds to its credibility. Both women say they saw Brown and Wilson wrestling in the doorway of the police car before Brown ran away and was shot at from the back. Then, they say, Brown turned around with his arms up and was shot at once again. 

How much more information like this has to come out before we see charges pressed?"

Someone call Nicholas Cage because Bostonians may have just discovered a new real-life national treasure.

A time capsule from 1795 in the form of a small copper box was unearthed in Massachusetts statehouse in Boston Thursday. The container was first placed in the cornerstone of the building on Beacon Hill by revolutionary war hero Paul Revere and the then-governor of Massachusetts, Samuel Adams.

The cigar-box sized capsule will be x-rayed over the weekend and its contents revealed next week. The artifact is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in Massachusetts, making it by default one of the oldest such items in the United States.

During the excavation, coins fell out of the plaster that held the box in place, good luck tokens tossed in with the box when it was unearthed and reburied in 1855, the last time the time capsule was uncovered, The Boston Globe reports.

2290,"Central Bedfordshire Council has refuted newspaper reports which suggested it was about to issue an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) to a six-foot mechanical bear.

The polar bear, named Bernard, is situated outside the Loft Cafe in Shefford and performs Christmas carols to passers-by but a story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper suggested residents feared it “could be hit with an Asbo after receiving complaints”.

However, a press officer for the council told i100.co.uk that the story was “embellished” and there had been “absolutely no mention of an Asbo or a gagging order, or anything like that”.

The council did acknowledge that one noise complaint had been made about the bear and council officers were therefore “legally obliged” to investigate it but subsequently deemed it not to be a nuisance.

We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation.

The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.

Central Bedfordshire Council statement
The story in the Bedfordshire on Sunday, which was picked up by the Metro and the BBC, has subsequently been updated with a small disclaimer at the end saying: “Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been ‘gagged’.”

Government guidelines say that anyone over the age of 10 can be given an Asbo for “drunken or threatening behaviour, vandalism and graffiti and playing loud music at night”. Sadly, it makes no mention of mechanical polar bears or any other inanimate objects for that matter."
2293,"An Australian tourist’s holiday in Bali ended horrifyingly when doctors were forced to pull a tropical spider out of his stomach.

Medical staff at Bali International Medical Centre said the spider had burrowed itself into Dylan Thomas’s skin through a scar from where his appendix had been removed.

The 21-year-old, from Bunbury, Western Australia, told NT News he woke up on Saturday morning to find a 2-inch red trail rising up from his stomach.

Later that day it had risen two or three inches higher up his body, he said.

When he first went to doctors on Sunday they told him it was an insect bite and gave him some cream, NT News reported.

By Monday morning the trail had started to blister.

Then Thomas saw a dermatologist, who recognised things were not right.

Doctors operated and removed a spider the size of a match head from his body.

Thomas told NT News:

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated.

“It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days.”

The spider, which was dead when it was removed, has been sent off for tests, and Thomas is expected to learn what species it was in the coming days. He summed up his experience on Thursday:

The Bunbury Mail said Thomas was now hoping his friends would help him raise enough money for a Spider-Man tattoo on his chest.

He is also apparently hoping the ordeal leaves a “gnarly scar” on his body.

update

A number of scientists in Perth have now cast doubt over Thomas’ claims and said the red trail may have been caused by a mite rather than a spider.

Arachnologist Dr Volker Framenau told WA Today: “We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider.”    BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById(""update_article_update_time_4050373"").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date('2014-10-17 18:18:33 -0400', 'update'); });"
2295,"Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said today.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria.

Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhindered

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'.

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network.

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place.

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'"
2296,"North Korean despot Kim Jong-un has been guzzling pint after pint of ‘snake wine’, with the body of a dead cobra in the bottle – in a vain attempt to restore life to genitals he may not have seen for years due to his vast bulk.

Locals believe that the meaty brew increases the size of a man’s manhood – and improves chances of pregnancy.

Kim has piled on enormous amounts of weight after bingeing on Emmenthal cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky, and the 31-year-old is struggling to father a child with his lucky young wife, Ri Joi-Su, 22.

Kim believes that glugging litres of wine, mixed with rotting flesh and venom could be just the ticket to restore his virility and father a sibling for daughter Ju-ae, two.

One South Korean ex-pat said, ‘The elite in the country joke that he is too big to please his wife and that’s why they do not have any other children.’

‘One senior official said that Kim was drinking many bottles of snake wine to help him in the bedroom department.’

Jong-un was first exposed to Emmenthal while studying in Switzerland as a young man, and his fondness for the cheese is said to have rapidly escalated into dependence.

His ballooning weight is thought to be a result of daily binges on the cheese, which is used in fondues, gratins, raclettes and sandwiches.

“One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,” said the leader of the Catholic Church, according to Italian news sources. 

This is a significant pivot from the position held by Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. In 2008, he said that when an animal dies, it “just means the end of existence on Earth.”

Francis has consistently made headlines with sometimes controversial remarks since assuming the papacy in 2013.

Vatican observers have called him a ""radical"" because of his open-mindedness and desire to reach out to ""the grassroots of Catholic life.""

The 77-year-old leader of the world's one billion Roman Catholics has adopted more liberal positions than his predecessor, stirring up tensions with conservative Catholics on issues such as homosexuality and single motherhood. 

In one such instance in July 2013, Francis struck a compassionate tone when speaking about homosexuality. 

""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" he said to reporters on a flight returning to the Vatican from Brazil. 

Francis's papal name comes from St. Francis of Assisi, the church's patron saint of animals and the ecology."
2299,"A new survey from UBS suggests that the Apple Watch could get off to a strong start, leading the investment firm to predict sales of 24 million units and gross profit of $3.4 billion from the wearable device in its first few months alone.

In its poll of 4,000 consumers, UBS found that 10 percent of consumers said they are ""very likely"" to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. Applying that same percentage to the total number of eligible iPhone owners, UBS believes Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches in its first nine months of availability.

Detailing the results in a note to investors on Monday, analyst Steven Milunovich noted that the first version of the Apple Watch has a number of limitations, most notably its dependence on a connected iPhone for functionality. But he believes the first-generation device will set up Apple for long-term success in the wearables market.

Still, in the first few months, Milunovich believes Apple will sell 24 million of its Watch with an average price between $420 and $430. That would result in sales of $10.3 billion, and with an assumed 33 percent level of gross margin, would add $3.4 billion in profit to the company's bottom line for fiscal 2015.

Apple's fiscal 2015 concludes at the end of September, so Milunovich's estimates don't include the 2015 holiday shopping season.

Looking to fiscal 2016, Milunovich's estimates increase to 40 million units, resulting in $17 billion in sales and $6.2 billion in profit. And by 2018, his projections call for Apple to be selling 67.6 million Apple Watch units in a single fiscal year.

The analyst said it's likely that the iPhone and Apple Watch will prove to be complementary products, much like the Mac and iPad. But he said it's also possible that the Apple Watch could eventually become the successor to the iPhone.

""Given that two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables,"" Mulinovich said. ""With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market.""

The UBS survey also delved into specific brands, and found that for now consumers are more interested in the currently available Samsung Gear. Among respondents who plan to buy a smartwatch, 37 percent said they would purchase a SamsungGear, while 25 percent said they are waiting for the Apple Watch.

Milunovich expects the tables to quickly turn in early 2015, when the Apple Watch becomes available and shakes up the existing wearables market.

""Just as Apple wasn't the first MP3 or smartphone vendor but redefined those categories, we expect Apple Watch to become first to mind in smartwatches,"" he said.

UBS has maintained its ""buy"" rating for AAPL stock with a 12-month price target of $125."
2302,"Online reports in jihadi and Palestinian forums claim Gill Rosenberg was captured by Islamic State group in embattled town of Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, the Israeli-Canadian who joined Kurdish forces in their battles against the radical Islamic State terror group has been reportedly taken captive by the group, unconfirmed reports claimed.

Rosenberg, 31, is a civil aviation pilot who enlisted in an Israeli army search-and-rescue unit before being arrested in 2009, extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Rosenberg said that she had made contact with the Kurds through Facebook, asking them to allow her to join the Kurdish People's Protection Units, commonly known as the YPG.

On her Facebook page, Rosenberg shared her plans for her mission in Syria two months in advance, when she uploaded a picture from Jerusalem showing an Israeli flag next to an Islamic State flag, and continued posting images until her November 1, her final day in Israel.

She later posted pictures from Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, Jordan, and then from Erbil International Airport in Kurdistan. On November 9, she uploaded images from the Kurdish region of Syria and wrote, ""In the IDF (Israeli army), we say 'aharai', After Me. Let's show ISIS (Islamic State) what that means."" A friend wrote, ""Take care of yourself, friend. You are one strong woman, and you'll destroy the Islamic State.""

A source in the Kurdistan region with knowledge of the issue said Rosenberg was the first foreign woman to join YPG, the Kurds' dominant fighting force in northern Syria. She has crossed into Syria and is one of around 10 Westerners recruited by YPG, the source said.

Rosenberg could not be reached by Reuters for comment. A source provided an Iraqi Kurdistan cellphone number for her, but it was turned off on Tuesday.

""That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,"" Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynecologist from Sarajevo, said, describing the growing trend as ""worrying.""

Apart from educational institutes, parents should also play a significant role in providing effective sex education, he said.

""It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences,"" he continued. ""We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""

2306,"Militants with the Islamic State jihadi group have released a video that appears to show the beheading of a British hostage, David Haines, an aid worker who was captured just days after he arrived in Syria last year.

British government officials were seeking to authenticate the video which purported to show the final moments of Haines, who was 44.

In the video, entitled A Message to the Allies of America, a masked man is shown carrying out the beheading of Haines, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film showing the murder of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The video, which runs to two minutes and 28 seconds, ends with a warning that a second British hostage would be the next to die. He has been named in international media and on social media as Alan Henning, a British aid worker.

Haines is the third western hostage and the first Briton to be killed in this fashion by Isis – the first, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, issued a statement denouncing the killing. “This is a despicable and appalling murder of an innocent aid worker. It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal.

“We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.”

Cameron will gather senior representatives of the military and security services and the Foreign Office and Home Office in Whitehall to discuss the situation.

The US president, Barack Obama, also condemned the killing. “The United States strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group Isil,” he said, using his administration’s preferred acronym for Isis. “Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom.

“The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve. We will work with the UK and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world.”

The recording features a voiceover delivered by an Isis militant, whose voice and accent closely resembles that of the killer in both the Sotloff and Foley videos. The killer directly addresses Cameron, saying that Haines “has to pay the price for your promise” to arm Kurdish peshmerga fighters against Isis.

Speaking to the camera, the hostage, composed but clearly under duress, and wearing an orange jumpsuit, reads out a statement in which he says that Cameron is “entirely responsible for my execution” for entering into a coalition with the US.

Haines, who was in the Royal Air Force for 12 years before moving into aid work, addresses Cameron, saying: “You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans.

“Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

The killer, swathed in black, then makes a statement in which he makes a direct reference to the British government’s aid to Kurdish fighters.

He says: “This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State. Ironically, he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction. And playing the role of the obedient lapdog, Cameron, will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war.”

At the end of the latest video, another hostage, Henning, is paraded.

The US carried out at least nine air strikes last week on Isis militants threatening the Haditha dam. The bombing was cited by Haines’s killer in the video.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office in London said: “We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents.”

Isis had threatened to kill Haines, a father of two, in a video that emerged 11 days ago in which Sotloff was murdered. Less than 24 hours before the latest video emerged, the Haines family had made a plea to the jihadis to respond to their efforts to make contact.

The family statement, which was released by the Foreign Office and addressed the militants directly, said: “We are the family of David Haines. We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

Haines was born in East Yorkshire but raised in Perthshire, and before his capture was living in Croatia with his second wife Dragana.

He had a 17-year-old daughter with his first wife Louise, and a four-year-old daughter with Dragana, who has described him as a “fantastic man and father”. He was kidnapped while working for the aid organisation Acted, having previously worked in Libya and South Sudan.

A meeting of the British government’s emergency committee, Cobra, is expected to be called imminently and the prime minister’s attentions will be diverted from the referendum on Scottish independence, due to take place on Thursday.

Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world’s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was in Libya during its civil war in 2011, working as head of mission for Handicap International, which helps disabled people in poverty and conflict zones around the world."

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.”

2311,"Apple is reportedly aiming to sell upwards of 50 million Apple Watches in 2015.

The news comes via a new report from Digitimes, which claims that Apple has placed orders for shipments of up to five million AMOLED panels per month throughout the year. These screens will be used as the innovative touch-sensitive display for Apple’s wearables debut.

The panels are being sourced exclusively from LG, which is already a supplier for many Apple LCD panels, although it has not previously supplied the company with AMOLEDs.

The projected sales are on the top end of those suggested by Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty, who previously said that the iWatch could achieve sales in the region of 30-60 million units in its first year on the market, thanks to the “halo effect” of brand loyalty to Apple that will drive sales of the product.

If Apple can sell 50 million+ Apple Watch devices that will make it the fastest selling new iOS device in history. The iPad, by comparison, sold 19.5 million units in its first year, while the iPhone moved a relatively paltry 5.4 million units.

The unidentified man who made the recording says he was using a phone app to create a video text message at the same time the unarmed 18-year-old was killed in a midday confrontation with a cop in Ferguson, Missouri, on Aug. 9, according to his lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal. ""He didn’t know necessarily what was going on outside until later, and that’s when he put two and two together and realized he may have recorded what was going on at the time,"" Blumenthal said.

Blumenthal said the FBI has interviewed her client and listened to the recording, which was first reported by CNN. NBC News has obtained the recording but cannot independently verify that the sounds on it are linked to the Brown shooting, and the FBI had no comment. Autopsy reports say that Brown was shot at least six times, but up to 11 shots are heard on the recording. It's not clear why there was a pause in the middle, and the recording only contains 12 seconds of audio.

The sister of Luke Somers, the American photojournalist held captive by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, says that he was killed in a failed rescue attempt, Saturday, according to the Associated Press.

There are conflicting reports however, with the Reuters news agency reporting that Yemen's Defense Ministry said a raid by its forces Saturday freed a U.S. hostage, who was not named.

Lucy Somers, who said that she had heard the news from FBI agents, said: ""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" according to a report from Sky News.

A joint military operation to free Somers, conducted by U.S. and Yemeni forces, was launched Saturday, according to a report from NBC News. The network added that Somers' status was unclear.

The reports come just hours after the Associated Press reported that 9 suspected al-Qaeda fighters were killed in a drone strike in Yemen.

Somers' mother and brother appeared in an video earlier this week, in which they called on his captors to “show mercy,” to him.

A video released earlier this week by Somers' captors, al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, showed a militant threatening to kill Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

There has been no official comment or confirmation of Somers' status.

2321,"OFFICIAL: Celebrates wider range of identities and expressions, protects young women from sexual violence

ELON, N.C. – Elon University has dropped the term “freshman” from its vocabulary and replaced it with “first-year,” a move made official this fall and implemented in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

The change at the small, private liberal arts college in North Carolina was done to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and ensure the campus did not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students, campus officials said in interviews with The College Fix.

Leigh-Anne Royster, director of Elon’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing,” said in an email to The College Fix that she has been told by some that they believe the term “freshman” is outdated, and that replacing “freshman” with “first year” is a “celebration of diversity.”

Royster stated the word “freshman” naturally insinuates a hierarchy among students on campus. She said she believes that students are viewed as younger and less experienced when referred to as “freshman.” With that, Royster stated “freshman” may contribute to sexual violence on campus because it labels the youngest students, causing them to be targets.

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Royster said. “Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way.”

Royster said she believes this change will positively impact future students at Elon and foster progress in inclusivity related to gender.

“Using language that allows for a more inclusive understanding of gender will be important in our culture moving forward,” she said. “Moving away from language, including pronouns, that denote a gender binary will be something we see more and more as our culture evolves to celebrate a wider range of identities and expressions.”

At this semester’s student orientation leader training, administrators made it clear that incoming students must be called “first-years.” No public announcement was made regarding this change — administrators relied largely on word of mouth to carry the news.

Elon sophomore Alaina Schukraft, an orientation leader, told The Fix that each time an orientation leader said “freshman” in training, he or she was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” Schukraft said. “They were very adamant about using the correct terminology and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.”

But when the new wording was rolled out, not all incoming students were comfortable with this change. Schukraft said multiple incoming students approached her saying they were more comfortable with the term “freshman.”

But Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, said in an email to The College Fix that the change improves the campus environment.

Zaiser said administrators believe the change keeps with Elon’s core values, and is a more appropriate description for new students. He added some believe “freshmen” is a “sexist” term, and Elon is attempting to move away from gendered stereotypes.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an email to The College Fix. “ ‘Freshman’ isn’t necessarily wrong, but it’s not completely applicable to Elon’s entire population, which includes internationals, transfers, spring admits, along with traditional students beginning their first year on a college campus.”

College Fix contributor Diana Stancy is a student at Elon University and president of the Network of enlightened Women (NeW) chapter at Elon.

In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 
'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 
'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 
'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 
'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.'
She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.

2325,"BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership said on Thursday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.

North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on Sept. 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

""He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

""He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,"" the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.

""Kim Jong Un is in total control,"" said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.

If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.

""The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,"" said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ""discomfort"".

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were ""rubbish"".

""It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,"" said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.

Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked ""the Marshal"" for his support during the competition.

Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.

""Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,"" he said.

2326,"Culkin is still the lead singer of a comedy band called Pizza Underground

Macaulay Culkin is again the subject of death hoaxes, with the latest alleging that he was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on Friday just seven months after the last rumour.

The claims about the actor and musician, who rose to fame after starring in the 1990 classic family comedy Home Alone and is now in a band called Pizza Underground, spread quickly on social media from Thursday.

The misleading report on MSNBC.website (not to be confused with the real MSNBC) said: ""Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.""

Fans of the former actor's work posted emotional tributes after hearing the false claims about his wellbeing.

""Multiple unconfirmed reports say Culkin was found dead Friday afternoon in his Manhattan apartment after police responded to a wellness check requested by a family member.

""At least one occupant of the Manhattan apartment confirmed the apartment belongs to Culkin but police have not confirmed the man’s identity at this time.

""'The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,' said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department,"" the hoax statement added.

However, the actor's representatives cleared up the rumours on Friday and issued a statement saying that he is still alive.

They said: ""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. ""He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet.""

Pizza Underground perform Velvet Underground parody songs with pizza-themed lyrics and the five-man band have toured the UK and US.

In May this year, Macaulay stormed off stage during gig in Nottingham and cancelled the rest of his UK tour after he was booed and pelted with pints of beer by the audience during his kazoo solo performance.

He is also ranked second on VH1's ""100 Greatest Kid Stars"" after Shirley Temple and also starred in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York and Richie Rich."
2327,"A British rapper whose father is awaiting trial in Manhattan for a pair of US embassy bombings is a leading suspect in the barbaric beheading of American journalist James Foley, it was revealed on Friday.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary — who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head — was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as “John the Beatle.” Bary, 24, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Also under investigation are the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and traveled to Syria, Britain’s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK “within days” to help identify Foley’s killer, Britain’s Daily Mail reported.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed “the Beatles” due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as “George” and “Ringo.”

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ­accent all similar to those of “John,” according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper from West London known as “L Jinny,” whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled “Overdose,” “Flying High” and “Dreamer.”

But he was reportedly radicalized by followers of firebrand ­Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family’s plush home in the Maida Vale district of London last year, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah.”

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand — the same hand “John” is seen using to draw a knife across Foley’s throat in his execution video.

According to The Telegraph, Bary is on an official list of British jihadists who may be “John.”

Also on the list is Razul Islam, 21, the paper says.

In 2012, Islam’s two older brothers — including Dr. Shajul Islam, a suspended physician with England’s National Health Service — were charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents near the Syrian border with Turkey.

But the brothers were released last year after neither British journalist John Cantile nor Dutch photographer Jeroen Oerlmans appeared to testify against them.

Another suspect is Aine Davis, 30, a former drug dealer and gang member who The Telegraph said converted to Islam and flew to Syria to wage jihad."

2329,"Seattle/ San Francisco: Google Inc. bought six office buildings northwest of its Silicon Valley headquarters from Starwood Capital Group Llc and Blackstone Group Lp in a $585 million deal, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The properties are part of the Pacific Shores Centre office park in Redwood City, California, about 18 kilometres from Google’s main office in Mountain View, said the people, who asked not to be named because the transaction is private. The company said in its quarterly report filed on Thursday that it bought land and buildings for $585 million, without details. The acquisition extends a real estate deal spree as Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, expands hiring and makes acquisitions. This month, the company signed office-lease agreements for a total commitment of about $1 billion through 2028, according to the filing. “We expect to continue to hire aggressively for the remainder of 2014,” Google said in the filing. “Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy.” The company had 55,030 full-time employees as of 30 September, up almost 19% from a year earlier, the filing shows. Meghan Casserly, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment beyond the filing. Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut, and Peter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment. The Silicon Valley Business Journal reported this month that Google was close to completing a deal at the site. Fitness centre The properties Google purchased comprise about 9,34,200 square feet of Class A office space, as well as a 38,000-square-foot fitness centre that includes a gym, pool and spa, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. That’s more than half of the 1.7 million square feet of office space at the complex. The office building addresses are 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800, and 1900 Seaport Blvd., the people said. Pacific Shores Centre is a 106-acre waterfront campus that was developed by San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s. It lies about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. The campus, which includes sports fields and a park, is next to restored wetlands that are part of the San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge. Starwood Capital bought Pacific Shores Centre in December 2006, near the height of the commercial-property market, from its developer and Walton Street Capital Llc, and immediately resold two of the buildings. Starwood Capital paid about $833 million in the deal, its first office acquisition in the San Francisco Bay area. Blackstone in 2011 bought an $80 million junior loan on the office complex at a discount in an effort to gain ownership if Starwood Capital defaulted, two people with knowledge of the purchase said at the time. Blackstone then gained an equity stake in the properties sold to Google through a loan restructuring. Blackstone, through its Equity Office unit, has major office holdings in Northern California and is the second-largest US office landlord, after Brookfield Property Partners Lp. Bloomberg"
2330,"Journeyman golfer Dan Olsen retracted claims Tiger Woods had been suspended by the PGA Tour for using performance-enhancing drugs after both the PGA Tour and Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, vehemently denied the claims. 

Olsen told ESPN.com's Michael Collins ""it was only my opinon,"" courtesy of ESPN.com's Bob Harig. ""Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any firsthand knowledge or facts,"" Olsen told ESPN.com. ""I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview, and I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour.""

Olsen certainly made several major allegations. Per Harig, Olsen claimed on 730AM The Game in Lansing, Michigan, that Woods had been suspended for a month due to the use of PEDs and that an exempt player he didn't name had revealed the information. He also claimed that Woods used a ""cheater ball.""

""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,"" Olsen told the station, per Harig. ""I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Steinberg in a statement earlier, courtesy of Harig. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.""

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, added that, ""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations.""

However, the PGA Tour told Harig that if a player tested positive for PEDs, they were required to announce the suspension, while any punishments for recreational drugs remain undisclosed. 

Olsen's original claims, or opinions, are certainly inflammatory and it remains to be seen if he will be reprimanded

Until now, Woods has only had his character called into question by critics for his past transgressions, while his professional achievements were still held in esteem."

2334,"Authorities unearthed on Saturday unmarked graves containing a number of bodies on the outskirts of a southern Mexico town where 43 students disappeared after a deadly police shooting last week.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, told reporters ""pits with bone remains"" had been found outside Iguala, 125 miles south of Mexico City.

""It's hard to be sure that it's the missing students because we must conduct expert tests and find similarities with the people being searched,"" a state police agent at the scene told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The graves were in rough terrain in a hillside community that is part of the Iguala municipality. Police kept reporters far from the site.

The 43 students disappeared last weekend after Iguala municipal officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return to their teacher training college near the state capital Chilpancingo.

Three students were killed. Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

Witnesses told AFP that the officers took away several students in patrol cars after the shooting. One witness said he saw 30 to 40 people taken away.

The officers are suspected of having links to criminal gangs, raising fears about the students' fate in a country where drug cartels often bury their victims in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

Another police official said the pits on the outskirts of Iguala were found thanks to an anonymous phone tip.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

Authorities have detained 22 Iguala officers over the shootings and issued arrest warrants for the town's mayor and security chief, both of whom have disappeared.

The United Nations has urged Mexican authorities to conduct an ""effective and diligent"" search for the missing, calling the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times.""

Dozens of police officers, soldiers and investigators were deployed to the area after the graves were found.

Guerrero is one of the most violent states in Mexico, with gangs known as ""Guerreros Unidos"" and ""Los Rojos"" engaged in bloody turf wars."
2336,"Multi-millionaire religious ""guru"" Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh persuaded around 400 of his estimated 50 million followers worldwide to cut off their own testicles to ""bring them closer to God"".  The details of the bizarre incident have only just come to light despite reportedly taking place in 2000 at a hospital run by Ram Rahim in India.  India's Central Bureau of Investigation has reportedly accused Ram Rahim of grievous bodily harm and he is under investigation. He has previously been questioned over the murder of an investigative journalist in 2002 and has also been accused of sexual assault by female followers but has never been charged.  Navkiran Singh, who is the lawyer for Hans Raj Chauhan, the only castration victim so far to come forward, said his client and other victims believed they would become social outcasts if they refused to perform the ""operation"" demanded of them by Ram Rahim. ""They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet God,"" said Navkiran, in a report in the Daily Mail.  Ram Rahim, 47, dubbed the ""guru in bling"", is head of the socio-political organisation Dera Sacha Sauda and is estimated to be worth £26m. The guru stars in a spectacular new movie, Messenger of God, in which he appears to walk on air, tear tree trunks in half and perform other miracles. Though 157,000 people are thought to have attended the film's premiere in Gurgaon, near Delhi, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the revelations have caused sales of tickets for the movie to dwindle dramatically.  Gurus are big business in India, where their endorsements can help political parties get elected, and where millions of people seek spiritual guidance every year. Sathya Sai Baba, who was said to be able to conjure ash from thin air, was worth an estimated US$7bn when he died.  Even after death, some gurus retain a hold over devotees. Ashutosh Maharaj, who was certified deceased by medical examiners last year, has had his body frozen by followers who apparently believe he is merely in a state of deep meditation called ""samadhi"".

An Iraqi official told the Associated Press that the woman detained in Lebanon was not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim has clarified that the woman identified as Saja Abdul Hamid al Dulaimi, is an Iraqi national who travelled to Syria before arriving in Lebanon and not the wife of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The report noted that al-Baghdadi has two wives but neither is named Saja al Dulaimi.
The Iraqi official said that she is the sister of Omar Abdul Hamid al-Dulaimi, who is held in Iraq as a terror suspect.
The Lebanese Army officials claimed on Tuesday that they had detained the wife and son of Islamic State leader and self-proclaimed Caliph Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi.

2338,"AUSTRALIA — A man in Australia has been dubbed “Spider Man” after a bizarre turn of events during a trip to Bali.

A mark on Dylan Maxwell’s belly may look like a gruesome scar, but he says it’s actually the trail left by a spider that burrowed under his skin.

The tiny tropical spider burrowed through a small appendix scar and traveled up into his torso, leaving a red, scar-like trail from his naval to his chest. It survived there for three days.



Maxwell was visiting Indonesia when he says noticed what he thought was a scratch about an inch-long.

He went to a doctor who told him it was a small insect bite, but the trail kept growing up toward his chest.

Maxwell described it as “a very searing, hot searing burning sensation. It was like nothing I’ve ever felt before.”

When it started to blister, he says he got worried.

That’s when they realized the spider has crawled in through the scar.

He says doctors were able to pull the spider out. The spider was placed in a container and shipped off for testing.



Still, many are unconvinced because Dylan has not produced records of the account. And experts say that there aren’t really accounts of spiders burrowing inside people skins. Snopes.com has some discussion about Dylan’s claim.

I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might ‘crawl beneath skin through a scar’. The claim that it was ‘feeding and moving up through the scar tissue’ defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also skeptical because the ‘evidence’ (the spider itself) is not presented."

2341,"Is Macaulay Culkin dead? No, he isn't, but the Internet would like everyone to believe he's dead yet again. The Hollywood Reporter stated on Nov. 8, 2014, that Culkin has been the victim of yet another celebrity death hoax. No matter how many times the Internet may claim him to be dead, he just keeps on living and quietly enjoying life.

An article from a fake MSNBC website actually claims that the 34-year-old child star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. It states that a wellness check was requested by a family member and police went over to check on him and he was found dead. There is even a fake quote from the police.

""The apartment was exceptionally clean and we found no signs of abuse or foul-play so we are depending on the coroner to make a final ruling of what happened here today,"" said Det. James Patterson, of the Manhattan Police Department.

As rumors started being believed by those on social media, Twitter users began posting their mourning messages and condolences. This is the second time this year that people have believed the ""Macaulay Culkin is dead"" hoax and about the fifth time in the past two years.

The first time it happened was back in April of this year and there were memorial Facebook pages showing up all over the place. His reps soon debunked the rumors and let the world know that Culkin was alive and well.

So far, there has been no word from his reps about this Macaulay Culkin death hoax, but there have been no confirmed reports that he is dead either."

2343,"Oscar-winner Christian Bale, who has played Batman and Moses, is about to take on another iconic figure: Steve Jobs.

Sources confirm the actor is in talks to star in “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic about the late Apple co-founder.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin.

Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.

Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches.

“The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.”

“It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”

Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct.

Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

Bale, who can next be seen in Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings,” is still negotiating for the Travis McGee pic “The Deep Blue Goodbye” at Fox. Sources tell Variety talks have taken longer then expected because Bale was not interested in doing a sequel to “Deep Blue” while Fox wanted one.

Insiders say Bale would likely shoot “Jobs” in the spring and follow it up with ‘The Deep Blue Goodbye.”

2344,"North Korea may have a woman at the helm–Kim Jong-Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong–according to a rash of rumors that have popped up recently.

There’s several pieces of the news, with some indicating that the dictator Jong-Un may no longer be in control of the country.

Jang Jin-sung, formerly a key member of Kim Jong-il’s propaganda machine, said recently that a powerful group of officials that once reported only to Jong-il have stopped taking orders from Jong-Un and now effectively run the country.

The group is called the Organization and Guidance Department, and some of them want to keep the status quo while others want to open up the market.

“On one hand, it’s people who want to maintain a regime monopoly,” Jang told VICE News through a translator.

“On the other hand, it’s not like people are fighting against the regime, but in a policy sense they want to take advantage to get influence. It’s not actually consciously civil war, but there are these two incompatible forces at play.”

The insight comes as Seoul-based think tank North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that Kim Yo Jong may be leading the country instead of her brother.

In this Wednesday, July 25, 2012 photo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, right, waves to the crowd as they inspect the Rungna People’s Pleasure Ground in Pyongyang. (AP Photo/Korean Central News Agency via Korea News Service)

The NKIS says that Jong-Un is getting medical treatment for an unspecified illness, and that the extended treatment was actually decided upon at a high-level meeting in early September that was held at Yo Jong’s suggestion.

She’s now charged with handling important government decisions in his absence, according to the Diplomat, citing the report.

“All the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better,” the people at the meeting decided.

Yo Jong is the daughter of Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, and his wife Kim Yong-hui, and was first spotted in public in September 2010. She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, being identified as a “senior official” in the government.

Then again, perhaps Yo Kong is not in total control, according to Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” he said.

The possible leadership change comes amid reports of an attempted coup.

2345,"Video messaging firm confirmed today the tape where shots appear to ring out in the background was filmed at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on August 9

The individual who made the recording has remained anonymous but handed tape over to the FBI

Multiple shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire with a pause in the middle

A video texting service confirmed today that an audio recording - which appears to contain the sound of shots fired by Officer Darren Wilson when he killed unarmed Michael Brown - is authentic.

Chaim Haas, head of communications at Glide, verified the tape recorded by an unnamed individual in Ferguson, Missouri on August 9.

An estimated 11 shots are heard to ring out in the background of the recording with a brief but significant pause between the first seven shots and the last volley of four.

Glide released a lengthy statement on their website today which said the user had been live video-messaging with a friend when the gunshots that killed Michael Brown were caught in the background audio.

Scroll down for video

Glide, an app which provides a real-time video texting service, said on Thursday that the audiotape was genuine and that it was now in the hands of the FBI

The statement continued: 'Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second. In this case, the video in question was created at 12:02:14 PM (CDT) on Saturday, August 9th.'

Officer Darren Wilson shot dead Michael Brown on August 9. On a new audio at least ten shots can be heard

Glide confirmed to MailOnline today that the FBI had been in touch with them regarding the audio recording.

The start-up business also said in the statement that it was proud of their app user for turning over the video message to the FBI investigation.

Experts who have listened to the audio have said it could prove damning for Officer Wilson.

In the audio, the unidentified man is heard telling someone, 'You’re so pretty' then 11 gunshots crack in the background - seven in one volley, followed a pause and then a final burst of four.

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.

'He was in his apartment, talking to a friend on a video chat,' said Ms Blumenthal.

'He heard loud noises, and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards, and it just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.'

A police expert also said that the recording could cause problems for Officer Wilson who is on leave from the force while a federal investigation is carried out.

'There sounds like a pause in it (the audio). And when you hear that pause it brings some concern,' said retired Chief Deputy U.S. Marshall Matthew Fog after listening on CNN.

'It is very significant, because if you have a pause there it means somebody had time to think and then fire again.'

If the audio is genuine it calls into question the version of events that Officer Wilson and the Ferguson police force have claimed occurred on August 9.

The medical examiner of behalf of the Brown family released this autopsy drawing which revealed Brown had been shot six times including once in the head

At least two autopsies performed on Michael Brown have concluded he died after being shot six times by Wilson after being pulled over by the officer, including a fatal 'kill shot' to the top of his head.

Numerous witnesses, including Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, claim that Wilson opened fire after bungling the opening of his squad car door, causing the teen to run before turning back to face the officer with his hands raised saying 'don't shoot'.

Johnson then alleged that Wilson continued to fire on the 18-year-old.

Photographs surround the casket of Michael Brown before the start of his funeral at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St Louis on Monday. The unarmed teen was killed on August 9

Ferguson police and friends of Officer Wilson contend that Brown engaged in a scuffle with Wilson when the officer pulled him and Johnson over, tried to grab his weapon and then run towards him, leaving him no choice but to fire.

Indeed in recent days reports had emerged stating that Wilson, 28, was badly beaten and left with serious facial injuries following the fatal shooting in the St Louis suburb, including an eye socket fracture.

But CNN reported last Thursday that although the officer was taken to a hospital with a badly swollen face following the shooting on August 9, x-rays came back negative for any serious injury.

Earlier reports had claimed that the officer was almost knocked unconscious by Brown's blows, according to the source.

Last week, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Wilson had suffered swelling to the side of his face but gave few details of the injuries.

Wilson, a six-year veteran of the Ferguson force with a clean record, has not been arrested or charged with any crime.

He is on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation and is under 24-hour guard after death threats were aimed at him.

Wilson is 'traumatized, scared for his life and his family' along with being deeply concerned that a grand jury, which met for the first time on Wednesday, will make an example out of him, the source told Fox.

Mohammed Emwazi, 27, of Queen’s Park, west London, who studied computer programming at the University of Westminster, is said to have travelled to the Middle East in 2012 and later joined ISIS.

Jihadi John has featured in the horrifying execution videos of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese reporter Kenji Goto.

Unmasked: The ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London

Arabic speaker Mr Emwazi, who first moved to Britain aged six, was reported to have been raised in a middle-class family and occasionally prayed at a mosque in Greenwich, south-east London.

But after graduating from university in 2009, he claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by the security services - and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Mr Emwazi alleged an agent from MI5 knew ‘everything about me; where I lived, what I did, and the people I hanged around with’ and claimed the organisation attempted to ‘turn’ him to work for them.

One of Kuwait-born Mr Emwazi’s close friends identified him, telling a newspaper: ‘I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me… I am sure it is him.’

And Asim Qureshi, research director a British human rights group Cage - who had been in contact with Mr Emwazi before he left for Syria - said he also believed the man was Jihadi John.

Mr Qureshi told the Washington Post: ‘There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.'

Home: Mr Emwazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House (above), which is part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years

According to the newspaper, in May 2009 Mr Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in Dar es Salaam and sent back to Britain.

En route he stopped in Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia, home of the militant group Al Shabaab.

The Washington Post reported Mr Emwazi - who has also been known as Muhammad ibn Muazzam - then moved to his native Kuwait and worked in IT, but he was detained by counter-terrorism police in June 2010 upon a return trip to London.

They allegedly fingerprinted him and searched his belongings, and he was not allowed to fly back to Kuwait. Mr Emwazi was put on a terror watch list and banned from leaving the UK.

The FBI said last September that authorities had been trying to identify Jihadi John using various investigative techniques including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages.

Scotland Yard would not confirm the name, and Downing Street declined to comment on the report.

Mr Emazi’s most recent address was a flat in Leeve House, part of the Mozart Estate in Queen's Park - an area that has seen shootings and gang-related troubles in the past four years.

A spokesman for the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said: ‘We believe that the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.

‘“Jihadi John” is not special, in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

‘The fact that “Jihadi John” has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one's identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.’

In September, it was revealed Jihadi John was known to MI5 before he travelled to Syria to join ISIS. It was revealed security officials had identified him but his name and background were being kept secret to avoid jeopardising any hostage rescue missions.

Horrifying: Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid worker David Haines, 22 Syrian soldiers and Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (pictured)

Police and security agents said they also wanted to gather more information before raiding the homes of the fanatic’s family and friends.

Not him: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - a London rapper initially identified as a suspect - was ruled out

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary – a London rapper initially identified as a suspect – was ruled out after analysis of his voice as well as his height and mannerisms.

The 23-year-old came to prominence last year after he posted a photograph of himself on Twitter holding up a severed head.

Other Britons from Portsmouth, Birmingham and Cardiff have been linked to John, who is said to have overseen the torture of hostages and to have led negotiations for French and Italian captives freed in return for ransoms.

It is claimed he was making street collections for genuine Arab charities based in London at the time he came to MI5’s attention.

There is no suggestion that MI5 or the police had any basis to stop him from travelling abroad.

David Cameron has repeatedly called for the infamous terrorist to be punished for his crimes.

In an interview with MailOnline last month, the Prime Minister revealed how he personally watched videos of the brutal beheadings of British hostages carried out by Jihadi John.

'These videos are absolutely horrific and depraved,' the Prime Minister said. 'And obviously I take the time to see what they are doing so I understand what families have been going through.'

Speaking in November, Mr Cameron said: ‘You should be in no doubt that I want Jihadi John to face justice for the appalling acts that have been carried out in Syria.’

Briton named as Jihadi John claimed he was repeatedly approached by MI5 to become an informant and believed he was being harassed by agents

MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain but he still managed to flee the country for Syria, it was claimed today.

Mr Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa.

The British citizen, who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six, flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari.

But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian's officials.

He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists, Mr Emwazi told a confidant.

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group Cage told the Washington Post: 'Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated'.

Mr Emwazi claimed in emails that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co-operate and denied he had any links to terrorism.

Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man 'obsessed' with Somalia and would make them watch Al-Shabaab videos while in captivity.

In June 2010 counter-terrorism officers, linked to the security services and Scotland Yard, allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait. He was fingerprinted and searched, it was said, and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain.

In an email to Mr Qureshi he said: 'I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait'.

Another friend said: ‘He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere. He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.’

Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving.

He was 'desperate' to leave Britain and 'was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation', Mr Qureshi said.

Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed 'actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions'.

Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria, where he may now be ISIS' figurehead.

The University of Westminster was one of the 21 university institutions which have been found to promote gender segregation.

Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated.

At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’.

The research found that on March 21, 2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs. Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society (WTCA), a Hizb ut-Tahrir front group, and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker.

When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender, the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith-based’, which exempted it from equal opportunities policy.

In addition to this, an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’. It was logged by Student Rights for this reason.

Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend, the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too...the information discussed in the only women talks/or notes can be put to the public after the talk...the topics at hand do not only concern women.’

The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that: ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating, supportive, inclusive and accessible learning and working environment... The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.’"

2356,"Nigeria’s government and Boko Haram have agreed a ceasefire that brings closer the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in the north of the country more than six months ago.

Secret meetings held between the authorities in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, and representatives of the al-Qaeda-linked militia have led to an temporary agreement to lay down arms.

Part of the deal includes “the need to rescue all the captives of the terrorists, including the students of Government Girls’ Secondary School, Chibok”, said Mike Omeri, anti-terrorism spokesman of the president’s national information centre.

There would also be an immediate ceasefire, with Boko Haram apparently saying it would suspend its bombing and kidnap campaign, and the Nigerian army agreeing not to target suspected militant camps.

“From the discussions, [Boko Haram’s representatives] indicated their desire for, and willingness to discuss and resolve all associated issues,” Mr Omeri said. “They also assured that the school girls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

The announcement came days after protesters marched in Abuja to mark the six-month anniversary of the girl’s abduction. Close to 300 teenage girls were kidnapped by armed gunmen as they were driven back to their school in coaches after an excursion.

Some managed to escape, but an estimated 219 are still being held captive, reportedly in Nigeria’s neighbour, Cameroon, whose military was involved in the ceasefire talks.

There was immediate scepticism, however. One Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital, pointed out that Goodluck Jonathan, the president, is in the middle of campaigning for the presidential elections due next year.

“He’s having a tough run with Boko Haram, and he needs a boost,” the diplomat said. “It’s the main thing that people are concerned about, security. If he can score a ceasefire, great. If he can bring the girls back, even better.

“But we’ve not yet heard from Boko Haram. Until then, we’re taking this with a little salt.”

Aid groups working to secure the release of the schoolgirls welcomed the news, but also remained cautious.

“This ceasefire is incredibly promising, but we aren’t there yet,” said Hussaini Abdu, country director for ActionAid Nigeria. “Until every girl is released negotiations must continue.

“We are excited about the possibility of restoring peace in the country, but these girls must remain a priority and we therefore urge the government to ensure that the safety of all of them is guaranteed as part of any truce.”

Britain is among several nations that has offered assistance to the Nigerian government and its military to help find the missing schoolgirls.

Privately, Western security sector sources in the country report exasperation among those coming to help over the slow pace of the Nigerians’ reactions to the kidnap crisis.

The girls are understood to have been separated into several groups, making an armed rescue far more complicated and dangerous, leaving talks as the only likely route to their release.

Boko Haram has in the past insisted that it would only release the teenagers if Nigeria freed several of the group’s senior commanders, who have been captured and are in jail. There were no immediate details of what Boko Haram will get out of the ceasefire deal.

The group has been blamed for hundreds of killings in bomb or gun attacks, and it is increasingly choosing targets over an ever wider area of northern Nigeria.

It began as a local militia targeting people who broke strict Islamic regulations such as drinking alcohol. But it recently linked with al-Qaeda’s franchise in West Africa, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and appears to have taken on far more ambitious aims, including ridding northern Nigeria of Christians.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, frequently justifies attacks on Christians as revenge for killings of Muslims in Nigeria’s volatile “Middle Belt”, where the largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north meet.

The Telegraph revealed last month that the International Committee of the Red Cross had become involved in a secret prisoner swap deal that would ensure the schoolgirls' return.

Officials from the Geneva-based organisation sat in on talks between the Nigerian government and a senior Boko Haram leader that was being held in one of the country's maximum security prisons.

The Red Cross officials also visited a number of other jails, identifying a list of 16 senior commanders that Boko Haram wants freed in exchange for the 219 hostages kidnapped from the north-east town of Chibok.

The ICRC's role in the talks represented the first official confirmation that the Nigerian government was actively engaged in talks with Boko Haram.

Publicly, Nigeria's president, Goodluck Jonathan, has previously maintained that the government would never agree to any kind of negotiations."
2360,"Dramatic footage from an Afghanistan battlefield shows the moment a U.S. Marine survived a bullet to his head, thanks to his kevlar helmet.

According to Sam Arnold, who posted the video on YouTube, the footage was recorded on a helmet camera during a “joint helicopter raid” in the Now Zad district of Helmand Province in 2013.

At the start of the incredible three-minute video, gunfire is heard in the background, and three Marines decide to try to find out where the shots came from. They pass through a tunnel stocked with barrels and wood, and peek through a doorway on the south side of the compound. Then, a bullet strikes one of the Marine’s helmets, knocking his head back. The three marines turn around and run back to their original position.

“Dude, you got shot,” says the Marine who caught the dramatic event on camera. “I saw it hit your kevlar.”

“I did get shot,” the other Marine replies. He seems remarkably calm, but a little dazed. His only complaint is that his ears are ringing.

“Lucky son of a b—h,” says the one with the camera.

If you woke up this morning to a Twitter feed filled with recycled ""OMG BANKSY WAS ARRESTED/WTF BANKSY WAS NOT ARRESTED"" exclamations, here's why.

This week's fickle rumor started with The National Report, which for those unaware, is an American satire site. A satirical post on the site reported, in a joking fashion lost on many an Internet surfer, that a 35-year-old man had been apprehended by authorities in the London suburb of Watford early Monday morning. It claimed that a press conference had validated that the man was indeed Banksy, that the BBC confirmed the information in their report, and that five men in total had been snagged with counterfeit money and ""future projects of vandalism.""

So illicit! So false.

Just to be extra clear, here are a few things that did not happen today: The anonymous British street artist was not caught by a ""24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force."" Police did not raid his studio in the middle of the night like a carefully plotted drug bust. His name is not and never will be Paul Horner.

We do appreciate the fact that someone out there is trying her hardest to make the name ""Paul Horner"" a thing. Remember last year, when some trolly press release tried to convince the masses that a Banksy arrest happened? The name of the apprehended: Paul Horner.

Stop trying to make ""Paul Horner"" happen, Gretchen. It's not going to happen!"
2364,"The US is assessing whether an airstrike on an encampment in Somalia killed the leader of the Al Shabaab terrorist group.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said drones and manned aircraft bombed a gathering of Al Shabaab commanders in a camp in south-central Somalia on Monday.

""US special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions,"" he said.

Mr Kirby confirmed that the attack was aimed at leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, also referred to as Abu-Zubayr, and that the bombs definitely hit the meeting of Shabaab chiefs.

But he said it was unclear if Godane had been killed in the raid.

""We are still assessing the results of the operation, and we'll provide additional information when and if appropriate,"" he said.

The assault did not involve US ground troops, Mr Kirby added.

He declined to provide details of the special operations forces' unit that took part in the air raid or the nature of the intelligence that led to the strike.

The militant group is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, regularly launching attacks against state targets and in neighbouring countries that contribute to the African Union force.

Since taking charge in 2008, Godane has restyled Al Shabaab as a global player in the al Qaeda franchise - a transformation that was highlighted when it killed at least 67 people in an attack on a Kenyan shopping mall last September.

The US State Department has listed Godane as one of the world's eight top terror fugitives and, if confirmed, his death would mark a serious setback for Al Shabaab forces.

The bombing raid reflected a commitment by Washington and its allies ""to detect, deter, disrupt and defeat violent extremists who threaten progress in the region, as well as ... threaten to conduct terrorist attacks against innocent people around the world,"" Mr Kirby said.

2365,"When Apple introduced its Apple Watch in September, the company said there would be three editions along with various face options and bands. Customers will literally have dozens of watch configurations to choose from. Only the base model got an official price of $349, however. Now a report claims to have pricing information on other editions.

MacRumors spotted a French blog whose sources suggest the stainless steel Apple Watch variant will start at $500 while gold models could cost $4,000 and up. The iGen blog has been credible in the past, correctly predicting the size of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

If you take the view that Apple Watch is simply another smartwatch or gadget, the prices may not make that much sense. Look at the device as a fashion statement with smarts, though, and the anticipated costs sound viable. Apple has designed the watch and will market it as a modern timepiece that adds smartwatch functions to your wrist. It’s already considered a luxury brand by many and people are clearly willing to pay premium prices for that brand.

The stainless steel pricing is certainly believable to me. Look at Pebble to see why.

Pebble Steel fashion

 


You can buy a plastic Pebble smartwatch for as little as $99 now, recently discounted from its $149 price. The same watch and functionality in a more aesthetically pleasing stainless steel case will cost you $199, or double the plastic model’s price. It’s reasonable to assume an Apple Watch with stainless steel casing will cost $500 based on that. I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see that come with a leather strap, with an additional $50 to $100 cost for a matching stainless steel strap.

Unfortunately, we’re not likely to know the official retail costs until this coming spring, as Apple won’t be selling the Apple Watch until then. For now, potential customers have time to save up for Apple’s timepiece — something they may need to do if they want an Apple Watch in gold."

2370,"It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

ANALYSIS | Pope Francis turns up the heat on church's future — behind closed doors
Vatican sparks controversy by saying gay couples have 'gifts and qualities'
ANALYSIS | Has 'rock star' Pope Francis really launched a revolution?
However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

Misreading of remarks

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

'There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done.'
- Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini
""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to put the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.

The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

A spokeswoman for the New York Times did not immediately have any comment.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

What does Pope Francis think about pets?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity."""

2372,"Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton were expected to announce the change Monday, but reaction to the new policy has been mixed ahead of the press conference.

The NYPD’s old strategy for combating pot possession is going up in smoke.

In a historic change, city cops will stop arresting people on low-level marijuana charges and issue tickets instead, various police and other sources said Monday.

Persons caught smoking on the street would still wind up in the pokey, they said. But someone caught with a small amount of reefer would be slapped with a summons.

The new policy is expected to be formally announced later Monday by Mayor de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton at an afternoon press conference, but already law enforcement and reformers were weighing in — both for and against the new rule.

“This should free up police manpower to pursue cases of greater magnitude while relieving some of the congestion in the courts,” Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Donovan said in support.

The Drug Policy Alliance said it was “cautiously optimistic” about the new NYPD policy.

“Most of those arrested are young men of color, even though young white men use marijuana at higher rates,” the group said in a statement.

Richard Aborn of the Citizens Crime Commission said the new rule will have the long-lasting effect of making it easier for more young people to find legitimate employment.

“There’s no criminal record,” he said. “You don’t have the stigma of a criminal record.”

“I think it’s sad,” countered Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins. “I think this is the beginning of an avalanche. Basically, what he's doing is equating an illegal substance to a parking ticket.”

Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said they want clarity from the top for their membership.

“Anything less will result in our members being held responsible for a failed policy by a discipline obsessed police department and the multiple levels of police oversight it has,” Lynch said in a statement. “We do not want police officers left holding the bag if crime rises because of poor policy.”

Sam Pirozzolo, vice-president of the NYC Parents Union, said the new NYPD rule “sends a very mixed message to our children.”

“It’s saying that it's OK to smoke marijuana because it's now less of a crime, but overall we know drugs are harmful,"" said Pirozzolo, whose daughter is a ninth-grader at Susan Wagner High School in Staten Island.

As it is, misdemeanor marijuana arrests are down citywide in the first 10 months of the year — about 24,000 compared to 29,000 last year.

There has been a growing pressure on law enforcement to curb arrests for small amounts of pot because they are disproportionately made in black and Hispanic communities.

According to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, blacks and Hispanics represented 86% of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city in the first eight months of the year.

The new NYPD policy was embraced by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson during his 2013 campaign for office. He promised to fine those arrested with small amounts of marijuana rather than put them in cuffs and charge them.

""Too many young people are being arrested for low-level drug charges that leave a permanent stain on their records for what should be a violation,"" Thompson has said.

The de Blasio administration has been slow to embrace that strategy, but Bratton has spoken recently about handling some minor criminal offenses without making arrests.

Bratton and the NYPD’s policy of aggressively targeting low-level crime has come under criticism in the wake of Eric Garner’s death from a police chokehold after he was arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes.

Critics say it’s main flaw is that it pits the police against minorities, who wind up being the chief targets of the strategy.

2374,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Friday confirmed the death of the leader of the al-Shabab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was the target of a U.S. airstrike Monday in Somalia.

The Pentagon’s press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, confirmed the death in a brief written statement. President Barack Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, said the successful U.S. strike was an example of his administration’s determination to hit back at terrorists.

Obama said the U.S. would use the same approach in degrading the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

“We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kind of organizations” that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. “That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.”

The White House declared a counterterrorism success.

“Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaida affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,” a White House statement said.

“Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal – financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military – to address the threat that al-Shabab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people.” It added.

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008.

Kirby said on Tuesday, before the Pentagon was certain that Godane had died, that the U.S. strike was conducted south of Mogadishu and that it had destroyed the vehicle that was targeted. He noted that in September 2013, Godone had publicly claimed al-Shabab was responsible for the deadly Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya.

“Under the leadership of Godane, al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for many bombings, including suicide attacks in Mogadishu and in central and northern Somalia, typically targeting officials and perceived allies of the federal government of Somalia, as well as the former transitional federal government of Somali,” Kirby said Tuesday."

Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6 million - £4.3million - for her release.

Her death is not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan.

Earlier this week the Kingdom vowed to destroy ISIS and stepped up airstrikes on the group's de facto capital Raqqa after the militants filmed themselves burning Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh to death while he was locked in a cage.

Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6 million for her release

Victim: Kayla Jean Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend

Shocking: American officials said they were looking into the reports if Kayla Jean Mueller's death. The White House said it was looking into the claim but that so far there was no evidence that corroborated it

Mueller allegedly died during an hour-long bombardment on the jihadis north Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to an unverified statement on a website commonly used by the terror group.

In August 2013, U.S. officials and Mueller's family in her hometown of Prescott, Arizona had requested that her name not be published for fear of putting her in further danger.

ISIS had reportedly demanded more than $6 million for her release and is believed to have sent a video of Mueller wearing a burqa and pleading for her life to her aid worker colleagues last August, according to the New York Times

A statement released this afternoon by ISIS sources said: 'The criminal Crusader coalition aircraft bombarded a site outside the city of Raqqa today at noon while the people were performing the Friday prayer.'

'The air assaults were continuous on the same location for more than an hour,' it added before sharing photographs of a bombed out building that it claimed had come under attack.

ISIS then claimed Mueller had been inside the building at the time and had been killed, but added that no militants had been injured.

Reports emerged later today that the date on the photographs of the alleged strikes were one day off.

There were no images of Mueller herself and ISIS' claim could not be independently verified.

Mueller is believed to have been working with Spanish Doctors Without Borders when she and her Syrian boyfriend ventured into the Syrian city of Aleppo in August 2013.

Shortly after arriving the pair are believed to have been kidnapped by Islamic State militants and taken to the terror group's stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa.

Blast: ISIS released images of this badly damaged building in which they claimed Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed during an Jordanian airstrike

Rubble: ISIS Mueller had been inside the building at the time of the airstrike and had been killed. The group added that none of its militants had been injured during the raid

Several images of the damaged building were released by ISIS but there was no proof of Mueller being killed

Islamic State militants have claimed an American aid worker was killed during a Jordanian air strike, it has been reported. Above, a Jordanian Royal Air Force F-16 fighter jet pictured yesterday

American officials said they were urgently looking into the reports of Mueller's death.

Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for President Barack Obama's National Security Council, said the White House has 'not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates' the claim.

'We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,' she added.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters traveling with the president to Indiana on Friday that the U.S. does coordinate with the Jordanian air force on airstrikes.

He wouldn't say whether the U.S. was aware of the hostage's location.

The ISIS statement could not be independently verified but initially appeared on a militant website commonly used by ISIS and was also distributed by ISIS-affiliated Twitter users.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants.

Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after ISIS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot.

The Syrian government said yesterday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

There was no word from the Jordanian government on whether its planes had struck Raqqa today although unverified reports on social media claimed the city had been hit multiple times.

Miss Mueller had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in her local newspaper. She told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

‘For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,’ she said.

‘It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.’

In a statement today, her family told US radio broadcaster NPR that Miss Mueller had spent her adult life 'travelling the world and helping those in need.'

They said: 'After graduating from college, she spent more than one year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine.

'She returned home to Arizona in 2011, and worked for one year at an HIV/AIDS clinic while volunteering at a women's shelter at night.

Brutal: Kayla Jean Mueller's death is not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan. Earlier this week the Kingdom vowed to destroy ISIS after Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh was filmed being burnt to to death while he was locked in a cage (pictured)

Visit: A sombre-looking King Abdullah II of Jordan (right) is seen sitting alongside Moaz al-Kasasbeh's father Saif (left) earlier this week as he paid tribute to the murdered pilot

'In December 2011, she traveled to France to be an au pair so she could learn French in preparation for work in Africa.

'War sidetracked Kayla's Africa plans as she was drawn to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees.

'She moved to the Turkish/Syrian border in December 2012 and began working with the organizations Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to assist families who had been forced to flee their homes.

'Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she was extremely devoted to the people of Syria.'

Miss Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend.

All of the other aid workers are believed to have subsequently been released by the terror group.

Mueller is from a small town in Arizona where her father runs an auto body repair shop.

Her parents, both in their early 60s, have a large detached home on the side of a hill in a rural area of the state.

The university graduate was a determined activist as a young woman who volunteered for three years with a coalition battling genocide in war torn African nations.

The young humanitarian conducted two silent walks in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issue.

She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in US policy.

Her efforts landed her with several youth awards and she went on to dedicate her life to humanitarian aid.

If Kayla Jean Mueller was killed by ISIS, she would be the latest in a string of victims killed while being held hostage by the terror group.

The group also holds British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in other extremist propaganda videos.

James Foley

US journalist James Foley, who was taken hostage at gunpoint in northern Syria in November 2012, was the first Islamic State prisoner to be beheaded on film – killed by the man now known to be Jihadi John.

ISIS posted the graphic video of his death, shot in an unknown location, on social media last August as proof of their barbaric actions. It would be the first of a number of similarly brutal videos.

If Mueller's death is confirmed, then he will join a list of other victims, including Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) were murdered by the terror group

Steven Sotloff

Two weeks later ISIS released a video that shows the beheading of a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff.

In the clip the group said his murder was in retaliation for the Obama administration’s continued airstrikes in Iraq.

Mr Sotloff, 31, from Miami, freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines. He vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in the video of Mr Foley’s beheading.

The executioner, who appeared to be the same man who killed Foley, threatened to kill a Briton who was being held hostage by the group next.

David Haines

On September 13, just two weeks after the previous video, ISIS released a clip that showed the beheading of David Haines. This time the message was directed at Prime Minister David Cameron.

The British father-of-two had spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians across the Third World.

US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre). Aid worker Peter Kassig (right) is also dead

Alan Henning

Just weeks later the group released footage of the beheading of 47-year-old aid worker Alan Henning.

The father of two, who had been in Syria providing aid to refugees when he was taken hostage, was murdered by the masked British militant known as Jihadi John in a video posted online.

Peter Kassig

On November 16 US aid worker Peter Kassig and 18 Syrian soldiers were beheaded in a video released by ISIS.

Kenhi Goto and Haruna Yukawa

In January this year, ISIS demanded ransom for two Japanese hostages – Kenhi Goto and Haruna Yukawa.

Just four days later, Goto appeared in a video, holding a photo of beheaded hostage Yukawa. IS demanded the release of terror suspect Sajida al-Rishawi, in exchange for Goto.

Last Saturday, a video showing the decapitated body of Goto was released by the group.

The group released a video showing the decapitated body Kenhi Goto (left) last week. On Tuesday, Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh (right) was filmed as he was burnt alive while trapped in a cage

Moaz al-Kasasbeh

On Tuesday, ISIS released a video that showed captured Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burnt alive while locked in a cage.

The chilling footage, entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', shows the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is seen being set alight.

Within an hour of the 22-minute-long video's publication, Jordan had reportedly moved ISIS-linked prisoners to a jail in the south of the country which is usually used for state executions.

Two, including would-be female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, were executed at dawn."
2377,"Does Russia have better smartphones or are Russians just better photographers under pressure – like when a Yeti walks directly in front of them?
Whatever the case, the quest for better pictures and videos of Bigfoot, Yeti, Almasti and their counterparts got a new entry this week from Adygeysk, Russia. That’s where a local mountain rescue team, after getting calls of Yeti sightings in the Adygeysk area, went out to investigate. They found what they were looking for and had the presence of mind and steadiness of hand to take a video of the Yeti walking away from them.

Adygeysk is a city and tourist destination in the Republic of Adygea in southern Eastern Europe at the heavily forested foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The local remote rescue service, part of the Emergency Ministry, received calls of Yeti sightings, which prompted the TV station to investigate. Ludmila Hristoforova was one of the witnesses identified in the TV report and gave this description:
The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.
Senior search team Andrei Kazaryan was one of the investigators and says he heard the foot crunches and found footprints.
They were 5 to 6 centimeters deep and couldn’t come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.
The footprint cast and video were given to scientists and to a local museum, which has an exhibit on Yeti.
Location of Adygeysk
Location of Adygeysk
The Caucasus mountains are known for Yeti and particularly Almasti or wild man sightings, so this occurrence is not unusual. However, some video viewers say the Yeti walks too much like a human to be real. Others point out that this is a tourist area and any Bigfoot sighting is sure to increase the number of visitors (and possibly raise property values).

2379,"What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago?

This week, Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story. An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F-250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet. 

A representative of Mr. Oberholtzer’s company, Mark-1 Plumbing Company, tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year. 

Were members of the Ansar al-Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks? Or was there a more indirect path?

Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many, many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East.

But Andrew Collins, who oversees Jalopnik.com’s “Truck Yeah!” vertical, says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think.

“If he traded it in, he would have no idea where it’s going,” Mr. Collins says. “The highest bidder takes it, and they can do whatever they want.”

The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days. 

Car auctions, held several times each week, attract both used car dealers and exporters, he says.

Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that, generally, are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy, Collins says, who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor.

Exporters then ship the cars overseas, where they are fixed up and resold.

“The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants,” says Collins, who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year. “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them. But [exporters] could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it. It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller, but I don’t think it had to be that complex.”

An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News.

Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck.

Oberholtzer’s son, Jeff, tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country.

Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) told Fox News’ Greta van Susteren Tuesday that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” saying he received the information from a border patrol source.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, which has been rebutting similar claims for weeks, that’s bogus.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

One of Hunter’s sources modified the claim after the congressman’s comments, saying that those apprehended might be ISIS-affiliated or even American who fought with the Syrian Free Army, one of ISIS’ many enemies.

Hunter didn’t back down. “The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” a spokesperson told ABC News. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

2386,"In a horrifying act of revenge for U.S. airstrikes in northern Iraq, militants with the Islamic State extremist group have beheaded American journalist James Foley — and are threatening to kill another hostage, U.S. officials say.

The White House must now weigh the risks of adopting an aggressive policy to destroy the Islamic State against resisting any action that could result in the death of another American.

It will also confront the potentially necessary step of pursuing the Islamic State in Syria, where President Barack Obama has resisted launching airstrikes or deploying significant American firepower.

Obama was expected to make a statement Wednesday about Foley's killing.

U.S. officials confirmed a grisly video released Tuesday showing Islamic State militants beheading Foley. Separately, Foley's family confirmed his death in a statement posted on a Facebook page that was created to rally support for his release, saying they ""have never been prouder of him.""

""He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" said the statement, which was attributed to Foley's mother, Diane Foley. She implored the militants to spare the lives of other hostages. ""Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.""

Foley, 40, from Rochester, New Hampshire, went missing in northern Syria in November 2012 while freelancing for Agence France-Presse and the Boston-based media company GlobalPost. The car he was riding in was stopped by four militants in a contested battle zone that both Sunni rebel fighters and government forces were trying to control. He had not been heard from since.

The beheading marks the first time the Islamic State has killed an American citizen since the Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011, upping the stakes in an increasingly chaotic and multilayered war. The killing is likely to complicate U.S. involvement in Iraq and the Obama administration's efforts to contain the group as it expands in both Iraq and Syria.

The group is the heir apparent of the militancy known as al-Qaida in Iraq, which beheaded many of its victims, including American businessman Nicholas Berg in 2004.

The video released on websites Tuesday appears to show the increasing sophistication of the Islamic State group's media unit and begins with scenes of Obama explaining his decision to order airstrikes.

It then cuts to a balding man in an orange jumpsuit kneeling in the desert, next to a black-clad militant with a knife to his throat. Foley's name appears in both English and Arabic graphics on screen. After the captive speaks, the masked man is shown apparently beginning to cut at his neck; the video fades to black before the beheading is completed. The next shot appears to show the captive lying dead on the ground, his head on his body. The video appears to have been shot in an arid area; there is no vegetation to be seen and the horizon is in the distance where the sand meets the gray-blue sky.

At the end of the video, a militant shows a second man, who was identified as another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and warns that he could be the next captive killed. Sotloff was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border in August 2013; he had freelanced for Time, the National Interest and MediaLine.

One U.S. official said the video appeared to be authentic, and two other U.S. officials said the victim was Foley. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the killing by name.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge the crushing airstrikes over the past two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

Both areas are in northern Iraq, which has become a key front for the Islamic State as its fighters travel to and from Syria.

Since Aug. 8, the U.S. military has struck at least 70 Islamic State targets — including security checkpoints, vehicles and weapons caches. It's not clear how many militants have been killed in the strikes, although it's likely that some were.

The Islamic State militant group is so ruthless in its attacks against all people they consider heretics or infidels that it has been disowned by al-Qaida's leaders. In seeking to impose its harsh interpretation of Islamic law in the lands it is trying to control, the extremists have slain soldiers and civilians alike in horrifying ways — including mounting the decapitated heads of some of its victims on spikes.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists estimated Tuesday that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria, and has not released their nationalities. In its annual report in November, the committee concluded that the missing journalists were either being held and threatened with death by extremists, or taken captive by gangs seeking ransom. The group's report described the widespread seizure of journalists as unprecedented and largely unreported by news organizations in the hope that keeping the kidnappings out of public view may help in the captives' release.

The statement, which circulated on Twitter, said an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria killed the 26-year-old Mueller. The statement used Mueller’s full name, which had not been public.

The claim could not be immediately confirmed and ISIS did not provide photographic evidence of Mueller’s death, as the group has in the past with other hostages and its own fighters.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said they have “not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim,” using an alternate acronym for the terror group.

A Jordanian official told ABC News ISIS's claim was ""illogical"" and was part of the terror group's public relations campaign. ""We need to be very careful not to fall in their trap,"" the official said.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh, called ISIS's claim ""an old and sick trick.""

""So they behead innocent #US #UK & Japan hostages & BURN a brave #jordan pilot ALIVE & now a hostage is killed by an airstrike? Sure! Sick!"" Judeh said on Twitter, referring to previous atrocities apparently committed on camera by ISIS fighters.

The ISIS statement appeared to contain some discrepancies, including Thursday’s date on accompanying pictures purportedly showing the building that was struck, while the statement claimed the strikes occurred during Friday prayers. ISIS also claimed Mueller was the only person killed in that particular airstrike, with none of its fighters injured or killed.

Officials believe ISIS has misled the public before about the fate of hostages. The Jordanian government said ISIS killed a Jordanian pilot the terror group was holding a month ago, even though the terror group pretended he was alive during hostages negotiations last week.

Mueller, from Prescott, Ariz., was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013 after leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, according to information provided by a family spokesperson.

She had graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009 and “has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,” the family spokesperson said.

Mueller told her town's local newspaper, The Daily Courier, she felt called to help those suffering the most in the midst of the Syrian conflict.

“For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,” she said in the May 2013 report. “[I will not let this be] something we just accept… It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.”

In October 2011, Mueller uploaded a video to a Syrian activist YouTube channel in which she said, “I am in solidarity with the Syrian people.”"
2388,"James Foley went missing in November 2012

A video posted online Tuesday purportedly shows an Islamist extremist beheading James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria more than 18 months ago.

A graphic video of the purported killing, whose authenticity could not be immediately verified, was posted online Tuesday and quickly spread on social media. The video, which appears to be the work of the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, declares the act “A Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)” and retribution for the United States’ intervention against ISIS in Iraq. Some versions of the video and Twitter accounts circulating it were quickly taken offline Tuesday evening, though the video soon appeared on YouTube again.

TIME is not publishing the video. The video also includes a threat to kill Steven Sotloff, a freelance journalist who has written for TIME among other outlets, and has been missing since August 2013.

A Facebook page affiliated with the Foley family’s campaign for his release posted a message Tuesday saying it couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the video or Foley’s fate.

“We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,” the post read. “Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

A spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said the American intelligence community “is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.”

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said. “We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley “was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet café in Binesh, Syria,” near the Turkish border, the FBI said in an alert following the Nov. 22, 2012, kidnapping. He was in Binesh covering the Syrian civil war for the GlobalPost website and AFP.

Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire, where his parents live."
2389,"Small-time drug offenders in New York City could soon find themselves on the receiving end of a ticket instead of inside a jail cell if a policy change on low-level marijuana possession is adopted this week. The move would overwhelmingly affect black and Latino residents, who represented 86 percent of marijuana possession arrests in the city this year, according to the Marijuana Arrest Research Project.

Advocates of criminal justice reform applaud the proposal as a step toward softening the long-term consequences of having a minor drug offense on one’s record, but there is a chance that the policy, which New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce Monday, could boomerang. The strategy would require anyone caught with a small amount of marijuana – likely to be defined as 25 grams or less – to be issued a court summons instead of being handcuffed, arrested and fingerprinted. But doing so means those summonses would not be subject to prosecutorial review, which would identify if a summons was justified in the first place, legal experts say.

Under the current system, when an arrest is made, the charge becomes a court case reviewed by a prosecutor. A prosecutor could throw out the charge or refuse to prosecute should he or she see any indication that the arresting officer violated due process, such as searching a person’s backpack without probable cause. Prosecutorial reviews “perform a screening function to weed out legally insufficient cases,” Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law at Columbia Law School in New York, told International Business Times. Under the new policy, “that function has now been eclipsed,” he said.

That sentiment was echoed by Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson, who announced earlier this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana violations. The Brooklyn DA’s office has dismissed 849 misdemeanor marijuana cases that involved arrest out of 2,526 such cases since July, according to the New York Times. Allowing police officers to write tickets without accountability creates “a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place,” Thompson told the Times. “These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.”

Another possible repercussion of the city’s proposed policy change could be that arrest warrants are later issued for people who miss their court dates, adding possibly thousands of cases to the docket. Some 28,000 people were arrested on minor marijuana charges in 2013; issuing arrest warrants for all the people who fall sick or cannot miss work on the day of their summonses would put more stress on an already overburdened system. “It’s not solving the problem that they’re trying to solve,” Fagan said.

As many states, counties and cities across the country have done at various times over the past several decades, New York decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 1977. The law made possession of the drug a ticketable offense and applied to marijuana that was out of public view and was not being smoked. Nevertheless, police have continued to arrest people and charge them with misdemeanors after finding small amounts of marijuana in their pockets or belongings. ""At this point, [not arresting people for weed] wouldn't be progressive; it'd be catching up with the mainstream,"" Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director of the Drug Policy Alliance, told Vice."

The two-minute long footage was allegedly filmed in the outskirts of the Syrian Kurdish-majority town, which has been besieged by jihadists after a fierce military assault.

In the clip, armed Isis fighters show several boxes containing weapons, munitions and grenades that were allegedly airdropped by US C-130 cargo planes and were from the Iraqi Kurdistan government. German-manufactured grenades can be also seen in the video, which was published by pro-Isis Amaq News agency.

On Sunday, the US military said it had air dropped weapons, ammunition and medical supplies to Kurdish forces defending Kobani. In a statement, the US central command said US C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and supplies that were provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq, in order to allow Kurdish forces to resist Isis assault and take full control of Kobani.

According to Lahur Jangi Talabani, the director of the intelligence agency of the Kurdistan government, 24 tons of small arms and ammunition and 10 tons of medical supplies were delivered to Kurdish forces in three US planes.

2398,"His voice served as a call to action, an echo that continues today whenever a kid bellows the word “hip hop” into a microphone. It was in Henry “Big Bank Hank” Jackson’s lyrical wobble, the way he rapped through the Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” the singular hit that propelled a movement when it was released in 1979.

Jackson, 57, died Tuesday morning after complications from cancer, but his influence remains.

The news was confirmed by David Mallie, the business manager for the two surviving members of the original Sugarhill Gang, Guy “Master Gee” O’Brien and “Wonder Mike” Wright.

Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.
-  
“They say that miracles never cease, I’ve created a devastating masterpiece,” rapped Big Bank Hank on “Rapper’s Delight,” a boast that codified one of rap’s central themes -- self-aggrandizement. Little did he know at the time how accurate he was, and that through said devastation Hank was introducing a flow that in the decades to come would move through culture one boasted rhyme at a time.

As seen on a widely circulating YouTube clip in performance on a local dance show, Big Bank Hank performs with a violet Kangol-style hat and a too-tight T-shirt. The hearty emcee grooves as he rhymes (lip-synced though it may be), lost in music with a fluid pelvic wobble. Next to the more restrained Wonder Mike and Master Gee, he is rap-funk personified. Hank embodies his verse as he raps of out-lasting Superman with a funny line belittling the superhero’s manhood. It's no match for Hank’s “super sperm.”

“I’m here, I’m there, I’m Big Bank Hank, everywhere,” he raps. Again, he had no idea how true that was, though he witnessed the music's evolution over the following decades as the hip-hop style he helped popularize become a form as vital to the ever-evolving story of American music as jazz and country and western.

This line, from the same verse, part of a larger bit involving a sexy reporter, further underscores his import: “She said she’s heard stories and she’s heard fables/That I’m vicious on the mike and the turntables.” That little turn of phrase carved into wax rap’s ongoing love-affair with turntables and microphones.

In the formative “Apache,” the Gang harnessed the titular brass and bongo breakbeat while they shouted, “Tonto, jump on it! Kemosabe, jump on it!” Big Bank Hank then made another claim: “I’m the one who shot Jesse James!”

To call the Sugarhill Gang the “big bang” of hip-hop diminishes the contributions of an entire community that imagined the music at its inception. Big Bank Hank, after all, got his start in the business as a bouncer and managing an act that would become the Cold Crush Brothers. He landed a spot in the Sugarhill Gang when the late music executive Sylvia Robinson tapped him to be part of a pop-oriented rap trio she was putting together.

Jeff Chang’s essential history of hip hop, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop,” describes the song as standing out amid party-oriented rap of the time due to the group’s birth as a studio creation.


Writes Chang, “Their raps on ‘Rapper’s Delight’ were the stuff that sounded good not in the parties, but on the live bootleg cassettes playing in the OJ cabs and on the boom-boxes --- the funny stories, the hookish slang, the same kind of stuff that would strike listeners around the world as both universal and new, not local and insular.”

“Rapper’s Delight” is considered the best selling 12-inch single of all time, though that’s tough to confirm in the pre-Soundscan era, which began in 1991 (and various litigation involving the track’s unapproved sampling of Chic’s “Good Times” further blurred the issue of numbers).

As happened with most first-generation rap teams (and second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-), Sugarhill Gang failed to sustain a bankable post-hit career, and didn’t receive royalty checks equal to its influence. In the years following the track's success, the style morphed in dozens of different directions, though, becoming politicized through Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, electro-fied through Afrika Bambaataa and popularized through Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys. 

Reverse engineer virtually any rap song since, and the circuitry leads back to ""Rapper's Delight,"" and by extension, Big Bank Hank. His phrasing, his fluid, funky tone, has endured, passed down from rapper to rapper, an invisible but essential presence.

2399,"Once again rumors of the death of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro have spread across the exile community and across social media.

El Diario de las Américas, a Florida-based publication read mostly by Cuban exiles, reported Thursday that the Cuban government had called a press conference amid speculation about Castro’s health. The Cuban government later disputed the report, saying no such press event had been planned, according to AFP’s correspondent in Havana.

The Cuban government’s lack of transparency and the lack of an independent mass media on the island have long provided fertile ground for rumor’s of 88-year-old Castro’s death since he fell ill in 2006.

Since the reports on Thursday Twitter has been abuzz with rumors of his death, though they have not yet been confirmed.

Twitter is saying #FidelCastro is dead. Twitter says people are dead all the time though. Let me not get my hopes up. #CubanAmerican

— MISS JESS™ (@M1SS_J3SS) January 9, 2015

As Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos warned, this is not the first time Fidel Castro’s alleged death has taken over the internet. In 2012 rumors of his death began circulating after news that Venezuelan doctor, Jose Rafael Marquina, said the former leader had suffered cardiac arrest and was in a vegetative state.

“Careful. Remember that here in Miami, almost like a ritual, Fidel Castro is killed several times a year” Ramos wrote on Twitter.

Thursday marked one year since Castro’s last public appearance, according to Fox News Latino. His absence at major events like the 56th anniversary this week of Castro’s entry into Havana after the victory of the Cuban Revolution or the return last month of three Cubans convicted of spying in the U.S. have led some to believe that his health has worsened. Castro has yet to comment on the historic resumption of diplomatic relations with the United States for the first time since 1961, announced by both governments last month. The most recent ""Reflection,"" as Fidel Castro's columns are called, appeared in October 2014.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was the last head of state to meet with Castro in August 2014 and published photos of their meeting. Maduro stated that he found Castro had an “impressive lucidity, an impressive train of thought and exceptional wisdom.”

Adding to the confusion, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga’s son, Fidel Castro Odinga, was found dead in his home in Nairobi on Jan. 4.

The girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram — the group's nickname means ""education is sinful"" — on April 15 while in school in the northeastern town of Chibok.

""They've assured us they have the girls and they will release them,"" Tukur told the BBC. ""I am cautiously optimistic.""

2405,"A man says Comcast contacted his employer and got him fired after he called to complain about the company's service.

The Consumerist reports that a man known as Conal complained to Comcast after he was billed for services he didn't actually have. After Conal's complaint, the company promised him extra television channels as a make-good but instead sent him a variety of equipment he didn't need.

Conal complained to Comcast again after he was billed $1,820 for the surplus hardware. This is where things get interesting. Conal, who says he works for a large American accountancy firm, compiled a spreadsheet showing every erroneous charge he had received from Comcast, which he sent to the company.

Comcast then apparently refused to reverse the error, so in February 2014, Conal decided to try something else. Being an accountant, Conal contacted Comcast's comptroller, the office that looks after the company accounts. He said he repeatedly called them about his bill, telling them that Comcast should be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

The Consumerist says that after this, Comcast got in touch with Conal's employer.

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

Business Insider reached out to Comcast for comment on this story, and we will update this article when we hear back.

After Conal's termination, his employer, the accounting company, said it had received an email from Comcast summarizing their conversations.

It's alleged that Conal used the name of his employer during his calls with Comcast, a claim Conal denies. Instead, he says, someone working for Comcast researched him and discovered where he works. To make matters even more complicated, it's reported that the company Conal works for provides consulting services to Comcast.

The ""lousy customer service from Comcast"" story is becoming something of a media meme. Previously, one customer showed in a video that Comcast put him on hold when he called to try to cancel his account, leaving him on hold for so long that the company's office closed for the day. Ryan Block's audio recording of a Comcast rep refusing to close his account is infamous. And earlier this year it was discovered that the only surefire way to get a refund from Comcast is to record your customer service call yourself.

2406,"Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Could ISIS fighters be training as warplane pilots capable of turning their weapons on coalition aircraft?

That's the worrying prospect suggested by an unverified report from the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that ISIS has three warplanes in its possession in northern Syria.

The Syrian opposition group also claims, citing reliable sources in Syria, that former Iraqi military officers are training members of the Sunni extremist militant group to fly them.

The planes are at the Al-Jarrah military airport east of the contested city of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The former Iraqi military officers are among those who have joined ISIS, and people living near the airport have said that they recently saw an airplane flying at low altitude after it took off, according to the Observatory.

Information on how the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which calls itself the Islamic State and is also known as ISIL, obtained the planes, or the trainees' previous level of familiarity with flight, wasn't immediately available.

CNN has not independently verified the report.

However, the U.S. Central Command sought to pour cold water on the report.

""We're not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" said spokesman Col. Patrick Ryder.

""We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

ISIS has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria, as well as parts of western and northern Iraq, for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.

Kobani airstrikes target ISIS

This week has seen an increased number of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in the northern Syrian city of Kobani, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Aleppo.

The strikes are helping Kurdish fighters on the ground push back ISIS militants in the Syrian town, according to sources there.

The Pentagon said its increased focus on the area reflected greater opportunity rather than a strategic shift with regards to the importance of helping the Kurds hold Kobani.

""What makes Kobani matter for us from an airstrike perspective is that (ISIS is) there, and that they want it,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman.

Retired Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt told CNN Friday that Kobani is not tactically or militarily very important -- but has taken on a certain significance.

""It's a small little town along the border with Turkey, he said. ""However, it has attracted the attention of the world.

""The world is watching the coalition fight ISIS and, because of that, a victory by either side in Kobani will have a psychological and strategic communication victory that far outweighs the tactical military victory to whichever side wins.""

In recent weeks, administration and U.S. defense officials have said it wasn't essential to keep the city, on the border with Turkey, from becoming the latest in Syria to fall into ISIS hands.

Anbar advances

Meanwhile, in Iraq's western Anbar province, ISIS militants have tightened their grip over an area about 15 miles south of Falluja, a provincial official said Thursday.

ISIS has brought many of its fighters, armed with heavy weaponry and machinery, in order to attack and control the town of Amiryat al-Falluja, the head of the town's council, Shaker Mahmoud, said Thursday.

Mahmoud urged the Iraqi government to send military reinforcements to support the security forces inside the town.

The deputy head of the Anbar provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi, told CNN by phone Friday that a curfew has been imposed on the city of Ramadi until further notice.

This was prompted by fear of potential suicide attacks by ISIS fighters, particularly during Friday prayers, he said. The curfew was imposed Thursday night.

Al-Issawi told CNN the situation in Ramadi was critical, with ""heavy clashes between Iraqi security forces and their supporters from one side and the ISIS militants from another.""

Car bomb attacks claimed by ISIS targeted Shia areas of Baghdad Tuesday, killing at least seven people and injuring more.

2407,"Published claims that a NYC high school student made a fortune trading securities turn out to be exaggerated.

Well, here’s a creative way to make your college application stand out: Mohammed Islam, a senior at New York City’s Stuyvesant High School, has become a local celebrity with the publication of a profile in New York magazine that claims he’s made $72 million by trading stocks and other securities in between classes, homework, and extracurricular activities.

Islam, who also appeared on Business Insider‘s 20 under 20 list last year, says he has been trading stocks since he was 9, having been taught by an older cousin who now works at Goldman Sachs. Though he started off trading penny stocks, Islam says he’s made millions since then by betting on gold and crude oil futures, as well as small- and mid-cap stocks.

Depending on your perspective, this story could be read as an inspiring tale about the child of Bengali immigrants beating the odds. Or as a worrisome example of how Wolf of Wall Street-worship — along with a taste for bottle service, models, and BMWs — is corrupting our youth.

If the story is actually true — Islam told New York that his net worth is in the “high eight figures,” but it’s not clear where the $72 million figure came from and no documentation of his profits has yet appeared — it would be interesting to know a little something about his trading strategy. We’ll update if and when we hear from him; so far, Islam has not yet responded to our messages sent via Facebook.

Update: Islam has now told CNBC’s Scott Wapner that he didn’t actually make $72 million trading; that he doesn’t know where the figure came from; that he in fact has made “a few million dollars” trading; and that he is uncomfortable with the way he was portrayed in New York. “The attention is not what we expected,” he told Wapner. “We never wanted the hype.”"

BEIRUT (Reuters) – Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State in Syria are training members of the group to fly in three captured fighter jets, a group monitoring the war said on Friday, saying it was the first time the militant group had taken to the air.

The group, which has seized swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

U.S-led forces are bombing Islamic State bases in Syria and Iraq. The group has regularly used weaponry captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies and has overrun several military bases but, if the report is confirmed, this would be the first time it has been able to pilot warplanes.

“They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,” Abdulrahman said.

“People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,” he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 km (45 miles) south of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the Observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

U.S. MILITARY KEEPING “CLOSE EYE”

“We’re not aware of ISIL conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,” U.S. Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said, using a former name for Islamic State.

“We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be.”

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State.

“We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,” he told a Pentagon news briefing.

Pro-Islamic State Twitter accounts have previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria but the aircraft appeared unusable, according to political analysts and diplomats.

The countryside east of Aleppo city is one of the main bases of Islamic State in Syria. The al Qaeda offshoot controls up to a third of the territory of Syria, whose civil war pitting various rebel groups against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has raged for more than three years.

2409,"The man who jumped over the White House fence and raced across the front lawn made it farther inside the building than was previously disclosed, barreling past one Secret Service agent and making it inside the building’s first floor, according to a report in the Washington Post published Monday. A U.S. official confirmed the details of the report to NBC News.

Omar J. Gonzalez, 42, overpowered a guard a Secret Service agent at the front door on Sept. 19, and made it all the way to the East Room of the White House, according to the report. Officials had previously said that Gonzalez only made it just inside the North Portico doors before he was tackled.

The security breach has prompted questions about how the Secret Service allowed Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife and had a hatchet and ammunition in his car, to make it as far inside the building as he did.

The report said an alarm box near the entrance had been muted at the request of White House building staff, and that the guard at the entrance wasn’t notified that an intruder was on the grounds as soon as she could have been. Guards are instructed to lock the doors whenever an intruder breaches the grounds, the report said."

2411,"A McDonald's burger bought 20 years ago has an uncanny resemblance to its modern day counterpart. Twenty years ago, opening statements in the OJ Simpson trial were being heard, a company called AOL rolled out Internet service, and two Aussie blokes purchased a hamburger from a local McD's. Two of those three things changed dramatically; one didn't, and in another 20 years that burger offering will no doubt still be going strong in all its wrinkled, uber-preserved glory.

According to 9News.com out of Australia, friends Casey Dean and Eduard Nitz, only 13 and 14 years old at the time, bought some burgers at an Adelaide McDonald's two decades ago. They ate their burgers, but a quarter pounder with cheese they bought for a friend went uneaten.

No worries -- the friend asked the boys to hold onto the burger until the next time he was in the city. Either the friend never returned, or the burger turned into a bit of an inside joke; either way, the teens turned into adults, but the burger refused to age.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Dean said. ""It started off as a joke, you know. We told our friend we would hold his burger for him but he never showed up, and before we knew it six months had passed.""

Those months turned into years and now, 20 years later, the burger ""looks the same as the day we bought it, perfectly preserved it its original packaging,"" Dean said.

The pair were featured on Australia's Channel 10 news, threatening to finally take a nosh. Even though it was for charity, the trustees of the burger just couldn't bring themselves to bite into it. Can you blame them? All of which begs the question: Exactly what is in a McDonald's burger that keeps it looking the same, 20 year later?"

2413,"You may have a seen a story going around Facebook that promises you'll be able to float in the air on January 4th as a result of a planetary alignment that will ""decrease gravity"" for 5 minutes. Unfortunately, it is total bullshit.

The story originates from DailyBuzzLive, a fake news site that admits it occasionally publishes ""works of complete fiction,"" and it's being widely shared because it includes a tweet from NASA that boosts its apparent credibility.

But NASA denies both the tweet and the bogus claim that a planetary alignment will somehow let you float for 3 seconds at a time:

""These rumors are false and the image of a NASA tweet circulating is a doctored image,"" the agency said in a statement to AL.com, ""Microgravity exists only off Earth. The crews aboard the International Space Station live and work in microgravity, where they conduct science experiments that take advantage of this unique environment aboard the orbiting laboratory. Temporary microgravity can be created using aircraft flying in parabolic arcs.""

Bad Astronomer Phil Plait also took down the hoax in his Slate column, pointing out that he had to debunk the exact same rumor last year, after it was passed around by a different fake news site. Not only that, but it's actually based on a hoax that's been around for 40 years.

Patrick Moore, cited in DailyBuzzLive's article, was actually a notable British astronomer, and he did actually make the Zero G Day claim in 1976. What the piece leaves out is that it was an April Fools' Day joke.

For the record, Pluto and Jupiter aren't aligning on January 4th, and it wouldn't matter if they did, because they're much, much too far away to exert the kind of gravitational force the fake article describes.

Here's Plait:

In fact, doing the math, I find that the Earth pulls on you about 200 trillion times harder than Pluto does. That's about the same ratio as the number of cells in your body to a single cell ... so this claim that you can float is like saying you can shed a single cell and fly away by flapping your arms.

Please let the circa-1997 R. Kellys on your Facebook feed know that, although you wish them success in their future endeavors, they will sadly remain every bit as earthbound as usual on Jan 4.

It's all about these wings. These wings right in front of me. One week's worth of wings, let's go.

Via Yahoo News, she explains:

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn't want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

2415,"A schoolboy almost killed by an electric shock from a street lamp now claims he has ‘magnetic superpowers’ like Magneto from X-Men.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, had been walking home after school when he lent briefly against the lamppost that was live from a faulty wire, and was blasted across the pavement.

He says that since the accident he has been able to attract metal objects like coins and spoons towards his body, just like the famous Marvel villain.

Nikolai said: 'When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.'

He said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

He said: 'I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.’

Nikolai says he has now decided to become a superhero rather than a fireman when he is older, as he wants to do something that helps people (clearly fireman wasn’t helping people enough).

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers.

Stories about 'living magnets' began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although people who have the ability to attract metal items are commonly referred to as 'magnets,' many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body.

Only some of them develop a 'preference' for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 'living magnets' gathered for a conference in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Scientists say however that rather than people being magnetic, it is probably nothing more than unusually sticky skin."
2417,"So it wasn’t just “discomfort” that’s been troubling North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un? Kim is being treated in a hospital because he has become so fat that his ankles fractured under his own weight, according to a report in The Telegraph that was attributed to South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper. The portly 31-year-old absolute ruler had to undergo an operation after putting too much strain on his ankles during a grueling round of official engagements, the report said. Kim, who is about 5-foot-9, is believed to have ballooned to more than 280 pounds, apparently due to an unhealthy diet that’s said to include imported Swiss cheese and heavy drinking. Bodyguards are said to have been posted around the ward of a Pyongyang hospital where he’s being treated. Just a few days ago North Korea admitted Kim was suffering from “discomfort” amid speculation that he had gout."
2418,"North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be opening a restaurant in Scotland and serving national favorites such as dog on the menu, experts said.

""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts,"" Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, told the Edinburgh Evening News.

""Despite voting 'No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""

The report comes just months after Scots voted to remain part of the U.K. in an independence referendum. North Korea backed the calls for Scottish Independence, and the historic moment could be behind the controversial leader's potential move to locate his next ""Pyongyang"" restaurant branch in Scotland.

The North Korean embassy in London declined to comment. The Scottish government said it was looking into the report.

The regime – which has been accused of severe human rights abuses by the United Nations – opened the first branches of Pyongyang near the border with China in the 1990s. Kim Jong Un's restaurant expansion plans saw a branch open in Amsterdam in 2012. This eventually closed down but reopened under the name of Haedanghwa.

Pyongyang restaurants are known for being a lavish and expensive experience. Traditional Korean music and entertainment often takes place. Jim Hoare, a Korea expert at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London, has visited the restaurants in Asia. He said the main aim of them is to raise money and up the profile of the regime abroad.

North Korea has been seen as notoriously closed to the outside world and its reputation took at further battering at the end of last year when U.S. officials blamed Kim Jong Un's regime for the unprecedented hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The move into Scotland could be to drum up support for North Korea, but despite Kim Jong Un's love of cheese and whisky, Hoare was surprised by the choice of location.

""Scottish food is very conservative and the idea of them taking to Korean food…I can't think it is the obvious place to go,"" Hoard said.

""This type of restaurant is not aimed at the Korean community but aimed at rich foreigners who might want to spend money, and may be more suited to London."""
2419,"Along with unveiling the Apple Watch earlier this year, the company also announced that the prices for the wearable device will start at $349. French website iGen.fr now claims to have an idea about the pricing of the stainless steel variant, as well as the gold variant.

According to the publication, the stainless steel variant of the Apple Watch will be priced around $500, while the gold variant will be priced between $4,000 to $5,000. This is in line with earlier rumors, which claimed that the top-end variant of the Apple Watch will be priced above $1,000. While Apple didn’t announce which variant would be priced $350, it is widely believed to be the entry-level aluminum variant of the Apple Watch.

As for the availability, the publication claims that the first Apple Watch will start shipping by Valentine’s Day 2015. While this is in line with earlier rumors, it is in contrast with what Apple Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts hinted yesterday. In a video message to the company’s retail employees, she hinted that the Apple Watch will launch in spring next year. She said, “We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.”"
2420,"An app manipulation farm sounds like someplace developers would go for a weekend retreat, complete with chiropractor sessions. In fact — according to a photo which has gone viral on social media in China — it’s a place where devs can pay for their apps’ download numbers to be artificially inflated.

Why would anyone want to do this? Simply put: because more downloads (perhaps accompanied by positive reviews) enhances apps’ chart position, thereby raising their discoverability level, and hopefully prompting people to download them.

The photo in question appears to show a worker at one such place, sitting in front of what look like around 100 iPhone 5c units. Reports claim that her job is download, install, and uninstall specific apps repeatedly to boost their App Store rankings. Another similar table can be seen opposite her.

The image is accompanied by a second one, showing the alleged prices being charged to get your app to the top of the App Store rankings. Here’s how much you need to pay to secure a no. 1 rated app for yourself:

The alleged price sheet claims that a person looking to get into the top 10 free apps list is looking at spending $11,200. To stay there, they will then need to shell out $65,000 per week.

By searching for “app store ranking manipulation” using China’s most popular C2C e-commerce site, Taobao, numerous similar services can be found.

2421,"Apple has been evaluating platinum for future versions of the Apple Watch, and may be using ceramic blending to achieve the extra-durable gold in first-generation Edition units, according to a new report.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal that Apple has been studying platinum casings, but that even if the company intends to build them, they are not expected to be announced during today's press event in San Francisco. Platinum watches can often sell for triple the price of gold ones.

The gold in the Edition Apple Watches is already anticipated to make them some of the most expensive products Apple has ever sold. Rumors have put prices anywhere between $5,000 and $20,000; for that reason, Apple is also allegedly installing special safes in its stores. The cheapest Watch will be $349, and midrange models could start around $500 or $600.

Apple may not be using standard 18-karat gold. Company exectutives have repeatedly claimed that their material is ""twice as hard"" as regular gold — which is fairly malleable — but haven't explained how this possible. Leancrew points to an Apple patent application describing an infusion of low-density ceramic particles.

By weight, 18-karat gold is actually just 75 percent gold, with the remaining quarter normally being silver, copper, or a combination of metals. The Apple alloy could use less than a third of the gold traditionally required while still meeting 18-karat standards.

2423,"It appears that there may be a serious bug with the ""Reset All Settings"" option in iOS 8, causing users who activate the feature to lose all of their iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive. According to multiple posters on the MacRumors forums, using the ""Reset All Settings"" option under General --> Reset has caused documents to be permanently deleted from iCloud Drive.

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.The ""Reset All Settings"" option explicitly says that ""No data or media will be deleted,"" and it is meant to reset all user preferences to the default out-of-the-box settings. That the option is deleting iCloud Drive documents appears to be a serious bug, though it may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. One user had all of his iWork documents wiped by using ""Reset All Settings,"" while other app information remained in iCloud.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.

There appears to be no simple way to recover iCloud Drive documents that have been erased by ""Reset All Settings"" in Yosemite, and several people who have been affected by the bug are now in contact with Apple support in an effort to retrieve their documents. A Mavericks user was, however, able to recover his files from a backup folder, and OS X Yosemite users may also have luck with recovering files via Time Machine.

One user said that Apple was waiting on engineers to investigate the issue, while another said his account had been placed in troubleshooting mode to attempt to recover the data.

Introduced with iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to cloud-based storage services like Dropbox. iCloud Drive allows users to store a variety of documents like spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and more, accessing them on any device. Currently OS X Mavericks users can access iCloud Drive documents via iCloud.com, but iCloud Drive will be fully functional in October, after OS X Yosemite is released.

Users who have iCloud Drive enabled may want to refrain from using the ""Reset All Settings"" option on their devices for the time being, in order to avoid accidentally erasing important documents stored in iCloud Drive.

2431,"The Apple Watch is on track for a February release, according to supply chain sources in China. A February launch echoes an earlier report from The Information, which said Apple will be “lucky” to ship by Valentine’s Day.

While mass manufacturing of the Apple Watch hasn’t begun yet, there are already concerns that sapphire production won’t be able to meet initial demand. The constraints will likely result in making more expensive Apple Watch models harder to come by.

All sapphire for the Apple Watch is coming from Apple’s plant with GT Advanced (GTAT) in Arizona. Because of Apple’s very stringent quality specifications, GTAT will reportedly be unable to meet the level of output Apple had hoped.

Not all Apple Watch models use a sapphire display, however. The lowest-end Apple Watch Sport uses strengthened Ion-X glass, while the mid-level Apple Watch and higher-end gold Apple Watch Edition use sapphire.

Initial supply constraints are not uncommon for Apple products, especially entirely new product categories like the Watch. If lines to see the Watch in person during Paris Fashion Week are any indication, demand will be extremely high when it goes on sale.

Since the Apple Watch was unveiled last month, it’s been clear that the product is unfinished on multiple levels. Demo units shown to the press have been running videos on continuous loops, and Apple hasn’t said anything about pricing. All Apple has said about availability is that it plans to ship by “early 2015.”

2432,"A California company is hoping to revolutionize the security business with autonomous robots.

The Knightscope K5 is one of four drones now patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus.

Matt Stambaugh, the Calgary Eyeopener's science and technology columnist, spoke about how the five feet tall robots learn.

""You take them to an area, apparently an operator has to walk around the perimeter where they're supposed to patrol once, then they go about learning their environments,"" said Stambaugh. ""What they're using is a variety of different sensors essentially to take the role of what a lot of private security contractors do today.""

According to Stambaugh, the robots are capable of detecting anomalies and making decisions.

""It's not quite as advanced as what Google is doing with their self-driving car, but they've got different sensors on board to make a map of the area and then they've got code on board to decide what is something that should be reported back.""

""They've got thermal imaging if you need. They've got chemical sensors, licence plate recognition software [and] facial recognition software,"" said Stambaugh. ""It looks kind of like a large Roomba. And so instead of looking for dust bunnies it's looking for, you know, criminals.""

K5s to hit the market in 2015

According to Stambaugh, the robots will be hitting the market starting 2015.

""What the company Knightscope is trying to do is to lease these out on a per-hour basis,"" said Stambaugh. ""So $6.25 an hour they'll lease you one of these K5s and that's about half the price of the average security guard.""

There are many advantages to a robot over a human patrol. 

""They'll work triple shift, 24 hours a day. The battery is supposed to last around a day and when it runs out they go back to a charging carpet and in 20 minutes they are charged up again.""

Stambaugh also said the robots do not have any weapons, but that may change in the future.

""Basically what it's doing is calling back to a manned response centre if something is going wrong,"" he said."
2433,"Jordan’s King Abdullah is reportedly personally involved in executing air strikes against Islamic State positions in the aftermath of the terrorist group’s brutal execution of Jordanian pilot 1st Lt. Moaz Kasasbeh.

Shafaqna news and Iraqinews.com claimed to have confirmed with their sources that King Abdullah is personally involved in conducting the air strikes. What remains unclear is whether Abdullah is personally suiting up and flying a plane, or instead commanding units involved in the mission.

“The Jordanian King Abdullah II will participate personally on Thursday in conducting air strikes against the shelters of the terrorist ISIL organization to revenge the execution of the Jordanian pilot [Kasasbeh] by the ISIL,” said the IraqiNews report.

Others on social media have reported similar statements.

Jordanian Author Waleed Abu Nada Tweeted on Wednesday afternoon, “Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow.”

Middle East commentator Joseph Braude wrote on Twitter: “Reports that Jordanian King Abdullah, himself a pilot, will fly sorties on ISIS targets.”

Before assuming the throne, Abullah II was a Major General in charge of Jordanian Special Forces. Abdullah is also certified as a Cobra Attack Helicopter Pilot. In 1980, he joined the UK’s Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. in the British Army.

Jordanian air strikes on Wednesday neutralized at least 55 Islamic State jihadists, including a top Islamic State commander who was known as the “Prince of Nineveh,” according to reports."
2434,"Two of the nation’s leading experts on the use of deadly force by the police are warning against overreaction to an audio recording that purportedly captures the sound of the gunshots that killed Michael Brown.

The newly surfaced recording, which has not been publicly verified by investigators, was first broadcast by CNN.

On the 12-second clip, it is possible to hear a series of what appears to be quick pops, followed by a brief pause and then another succession of rapid shots. St. Louis attorney Lopa Blumenthal and her client, who wishes to remain anonymous to the public, took the recording to the FBI on Monday. Blumenthal says she counted 11 shots fired.

“There's that pause, which is what gave me pause, when I first saw it,” Blumenthal told Yahoo News. “It was a pause so there was time to think about it and deliberate. That doesn't mean that I'm saying it helps one side or the other. But I do know that in a 12-second tape, where eight seconds of it is a shooting, a three-second delay is a significant period of time.”

Ron Martinelli and Michael Levine, both longtime criminal justice consultants, told Yahoo News that the audio needs to be authenticated and considered with other evidence before its importance can be evaluated.

“Pauses may or may not be anything of tremendous significance,” said Martinelli, a retired officer and criminologist specializing in police practices. “The answer is: It depends. In the end, this is about a forensic reconciliation of statements and forensic facts and evidence.”

Levine, a retired DEA agent and law enforcement trainer, said that anyone willing to put a value on a recording before it has been corroborated is discrediting themselves.

“If they gave that opinion on a witness stand, they would be chewed up and spit out by any defense attorney, even a defense attorney that got his degree at Sears & Roebuck School of Law,” Levine said.

Blumenthal told Yahoo News that she has no qualms about bringing the recording forward.

“There's no bad evidence, there's just evidence,” Blumenthal said. “It doesn't take sides. It helps lead to where you are going and discover the truth. Every little bit helps.”

The potential new discovery comes to light more than two weeks after Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, in broad daylight in the middle of a residential street.

The audio was unwittingly captured by a man taping  an online web chat inside his apartment near the shooting scene.

On the recording, the unidentified Ferguson resident is heard complimenting a friend’s looks during a video chat, when two bursts of loud pops erupt in the background.

Blumenthal said her client heard the noise, but paid it no attention because gunshots are common in the neighborhood. The unidenitifed man, she said, had to be persuaded to come forward.

“Even after I talked to them about it, they were very dubious that it had any type of value,” Blumenthal said. “My client nor I are seeking any publicity or attention at all. There's no motivation to say it is what it's not.""

Blumenthal said she and her client were interviewed by FBI agents about the recording late Monday.

Federal and state investigators are conducting separate criminal and civil rights investigations into the controversial shooting.

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has said Wilson was attempting to tell Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, to stop walking in the middle of the road, when the officer realized that the pair fit the description of suspects being sought in the theft of cigars from a nearby convenience store.

Chief Jackson said a scuffle ensued after the teen struck Wilson in the face and that a shot was fired inside the officer’s squad car as Brown attempted to grab the officer’s gun. But Johnson has told reporters that it was Wilson who was the aggressor, and that Brown never went for the weapon. Instead, Johnson says, the officer shot his friend while Brown was trying to flee but had stopped and put his hands up in surrender.

Wilson, 28, is on paid leave and has not spoken publicly about the shooting.

Blumenthal said her client gave a copy of the recording to federal investigators.

“(The FBI) thought this would be an important piece of the investigation,” she told CNN.

An FBI spokesperson declined to address the issue of the recording when contacted by Yahoo News on Tuesday.

FBI audio engineers are reportedly planning to analyze the recording for authenticity.

Mark O’Mara, the Florida attorney who successfully defended shooting suspect George Zimmerman, told CNN that while it may be too early judge the audio’s significance, the scientific review could unearth new evidence.

“I look forward to hearing if that tape has Mike Brown’s or Darren Wilson’s voice on it saying stop,” O’Mara said.

Separate autopsies performed on Brown revealed that he was struck at least six times, including by what was likely a fatal shot to the top of his head. Authorities have not disclosed how many times Wilson fired his weapon.
Veteran forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg listened to the recording on Tuesday.

“The gunshots are unmistakable,"" Ginsberg told Yahoo News.

By Ginsberg’s count, he said, there are 10 shots on the recording, but he said he could understand why an untrained ear might hear more.

“I can confidently say that I heard at least 10 shots,” said Ginsberg, who has worked on such major investigations as the Sandy Hook school shooting. “I'm hearing six shots, followed by very close to three seconds of pause, followed by four more shots.”

Messages sent to Ferguson police seeking information on the type of service weapon that it assigns to officers went unanswered on Tuesday. Levine said officers across the country commonly carry semi-automatic pistols with a capacity of 15 to 17 bullets.

Any potential pause in Wilson’s shooting would have to be weighed against statements given to investigators, Levine said.

Levine said the pause “would raise an alarm if I had qualified witness statements and the officer’s statement that conflicts with that.” He added, “But I don’t know what this officer’s official statement is here. I don’t think anyone does.”

2438,"Innovative might not be the first word that comes to mind in describing Comcast. But are we giving the company credit where credit is due? Let's face it, after that harrowing 18-minute customer service call went viral in July, it looked like Comcast had nothing more to strive for—it had reached peak horrible. Yet if reports this week are accurate, Comcast has continued to shine as an innovator in the competitive field of corporate terribleness: It got a customer's employer to fire him for complaining about shoddy customer service.

The full story in all its sadistic glory is at Consumerist, but here's the SparkNotes version. A customer named ""Conal"" started subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013. There were issues: erroneous charges, bills that never arrived, discounts that weren't applied. Conal considered canceling his service, but decided to stick with it after a Comcast rep promised that the issues would be resolved and threw in some free perks. As another friendly gesture, the company also allegedly sent and billed Conal for $1,820 of equipment he'd never ordered.

This is where it gets crazy. Conal, understandably frustrated, decided to bypass the customer service department and take his complaints straight to the Comcast controller. During the call, he claims, he suggested that a private-sector oversight group look into Comcast's billing and accounting issues. Shortly after that call, Comcast contacted Conal's employer—a large accounting firm that Consumerist reports happened to do business with Comcast. The rep claimed that Conal had name-dropped his employer as leverage during the call; according to the story, the firm opened an investigation against Conal and then fired him from his job.

It's hard to know who's telling the truth here. Conal tells Consumerist that he never mentioned his employer and that someone at Comcast must have looked him up to figure out where he worked. Comcast, for its part, has allegedly refused to release any tapes of the phone calls it made on the matter. That's a little strange: If Conal did invoke his company's name in a threatening way, Comcast could easily prove as much by excerpting the relevant portion of his call. So much for monitoring ""for quality assurance purposes."" If you want it done right, record the call yourself."

2441,"An Indian public official has been sacked for taking leave 24 years ago and never returning to his desk in the country’s notoriously work-shy bureaucracy, the urban development ministry said.

Assistant executive engineer A.K Verma went on leave in 1990 after joining India’s central public works department (CPWD) a decade earlier.

Verma defied bosses’ orders to return to work after his requests for additional leave were denied.

“He went on seeking extension of leave, which was not sanctioned, and defied directions to report to work,” the government said in a statement on Thursday.

Even after an inquiry found him guilty of “wilful absence from duty” in 1992, it took another 22 years and the intervention of a cabinet minister to remove him, the government said.

Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu ordered his dismissal in order to “streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability,” it said.

India’s civil servants have long been notorious for arriving late, taking long lunches or spending parts of their day on the golf course.

A 2012 survey by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk consultancy rated India’s bureaucracy as the worst among major Asian countries.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he was shocked by what he saw in the corridors of power after moving to New Delhi following his landslide election victory in May last year.

During his first few months in office, Modi developed a reputation for paying unannounced visits to government offices.

Fear of being caught playing truant triggered a rise in attendance levels among civil servants and Delhi’s main golf course has reportedly been largely deserted on week days."
2442,"Google leased all 1.9 million square feet of Moffett Place, a Sunnyvale office complex under development by Jay Paul Co.

Google Inc. has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in Sunnyvale and Redwood City that boost the company's Silicon Valley footprint by 2.8 million square feet – about the size of the Empire State Building and enough room for more than 10,000 workers.

Even by Google standards, the latest transactions are blockbusters: In one deal, Google has agreed to lease all of Jay Paul Co.'s Moffett Place, a 1.9 million square foot office campus currently under construction in Sunnyvale. It's a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in Silicon Valley and perhaps the state of California.

In a separate but no less notable deal, Mountain View-based Google completed the purchase of six buildings from Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital totaling about 934,000 square feet at Redwood City's Pacific Shores office park. It's Google's first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market.

""Google is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode,"" said Amber Schiada, director of research for real estate services firm JLL.

The deals — both of which I previously reported were in the works — were confirmed by sources close to the transactions. Google declined to comment for this story. Blackstone didn't return inquiries. Jay Paul's longtime broker Phil Mahoney of Newmark Cornish & Carey, would only say that Moffett Place is off the market.

Google's expansion on the Peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the 2008 Great Recession as the world's biggest Web-search advertising company has bought and leased building after building, radiating out from its Mountain View headquarters. Its real estate growth dwarfs even that of Cisco Systems Inc.'s expansion during the 1990s.

Terms of the latest deals were not disclosed, but sources estimated the Redwood City sale at around $625 per square foot, or $583.75 million. That would make it perhaps Google's single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in Silicon Valley.

""I welcome them to our city and I look forward to working with them,"" said Redwood City Mayor Jeffrey Gee in an interview this afternoon. ""For a long time I would go around and say, 'Redwood City is one of the best kept secrets in the Bay Area. With Google and everything going on, we're not a secret anymore.'""

Aside from sheer size, the deals are notable for several reasons. First, they showcase Google's incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing, self-driving cars and robotics — all of which could be huge space users on their own.

Google has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years. Yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion, suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs. Google counted 55,030 employees globally as of Sept. 30, according to its most recent quarterly report, up 18 percent — or 8,600 Googlers — from a year ago.

The transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table. Schiada noted that Moffett Place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in Silicon Valley. In Redwood City's Pacific Shores, which is more than 90 percent leased, I'm told Google will honor all current tenants' leases for now, but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead.

""A big question is what does this leave for tenants,"" Schiada said, speaking specifically about the Moffett Place deal. ""It also increases rates, because the supply becomes more limited.""

Still, that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product, she added.

""This deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development, which could prompt more developers to move forward,"" she said.

Jim Beeger, a veteran broker with Colliers International, said in the short term, the Sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market.

The transaction could ""cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site,"" he said. ""Moffett Place will be difficult to replicate, and those who lingered no longer have this option.""

Sethena Leiker, senior analyst for Cushman & Wakefield's Silicon Valley office, agreed.

""There's not a lot of spec development coming,"" she said. ""If you want to take any new space, you're going to have to take something that's proposed.""

One result, Beeger said, could be a ""trickle-down effect"" of growing tenants moving to other areas of Santa Clara County that have available sites.

Score for Sunnyvale

Google's lease at Moffett Place is a huge win for San Francisco-based Jay Paul Co., if one that's not entirely unexpected. Jay Paul already leased 949,000 square feet to Google in Sunnyvale at a nearby campus called Technology Corners, making Google a natural prospect for the new development.

And while Google has not yet started moving into Technology Corners, the company has also been growing elsewhere in Sunnyvale this year, snapping up the old Juniper Networks headquarters (424,000 square feet) and former head office of Palm Computing Inc. (285,000 square feet). And it's rumored that a fund, CBRE Global Investors, that's buying up land all around Sunnyvale's Moffett Park business district is actually acting on behalf of Google.

Yet landing Google wasn't guaranteed when Jay Paul started building Moffett Place earlier this year on spec. Other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property, according to sources. The rent Google is paying isn't known, but Jay Paul was asking $3.75 per square foot on a triple-net basis, or not including utilities, taxes and fees.

Redwood City action

In Redwood City, Google picks a up a major chunk one of Silicon Valley's marquee office campuses. The 10-building, 1.7-million-square-foot project was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds.

Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold two buildings to Shorenstein, the San Francisco-based landlord. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago. Informatica also acquired two buildings out of the 10 in 2012 for $525 per square foot. Google's acquisition this week is only for the six Blackstone/Starwood buildings.

As I reported earlier this month, a new owner could build even more office space at Pacific Shores. New zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways.

Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port.

Mayor Gee said the city would be happy to work with Google on such a plan, should the search company decide to go in that direction.

""One of the things that's always a challenge with new forms of transportation is, is there enough there there,"" he said. ""With Google, that potentially brings the there there.""

Naturally it has room for putting practice, with half a dozen tee boxes and a golf hole. It also has a private ferry, stables and pasture land, its own protected bay, a ""mini-mansion"" of a villa, a hunting lodge and a landing strip.

Oh -- and it also has a ""hill fort"" dating back to the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages that was more recently (about a thousand years ago) a Viking stronghold. Visitors can take forest trails up to the top for views like those ancient man might have seen.

Listing agent Sabine Rollinger of Vladi Private Islands confirmed in the Telegraph report: ""This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden anymore.""

Called Stora Rullingen, it's on Lake Malaren, about an hour from Stockholm. Three international airports are within 60 miles.

Woods married Elin Nordegren, a former model born and raised in Stockholm, in 2004. They had two children -- daughter Sam in June 2007 and son Charlie in February 2009 -- but their marriage unraveled when Charlie was a baby. Nordegren learned during Thanksgiving 2009 that Woods had been cheating on her, and soon after, his very public one-man SUV crash revealed their marital problems to the world.
Subsequent news reports said his dalliances involved perhaps a dozen women. Their divorce was finalized in August 2010.

Vladi Private Islands declines to disclose the asking price except upon application, but a listing at Private Islands Online prices the property at 6 million euros, or about $7.1 million at today's exchange rates. The Vladi listing pegs the property at about 62 acres; Private Islands Online says its about 82 acres."

But it’s almost certainly not true.

A screengrab of the likely untrue story of a priest who supposedly died and saw a female God. The picture of the “priest” appears to be a stock photo, not a picture of an actual priest. (Image via monitor.co.ug)

The story of the Catholic priest who supposedly died briefly and saw a female God has gained massive traction online, sparking debates on Reddit and getting picked up by everyone from the Dallas/Ft. Worth radio station KVIL-FM to viral news sites such as Inquisitr.

Yet the story does not appear to spring from any news outlets close to Boston, Massachusetts, where the priest was reportedly working.

Instead, the “story” was first reported by the Daily Monitor, a newspaper based in the African nation of Uganda.

Why would a remote African nation be first to an American faith story?

Because it pulled the tale from the World News Daily Report, a “satirical” website.

To add insult to injury, the images of “Father O’Neal” that accompany the stories appear to be stock photos (as Reddit user NewdAccount pointed out), not pictures of an actual priest.

It seems this story is another bogus tale in need of debunking, like the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory or the fake report of a military coup against the Obama administration over the revelation of an alleged Colin Powell affair.

Spokespersons for the archdiocese of Boston were not immediately available for comment Sunday morning.

2446,"RESIDENTS fear a mechanical six-foot-tall carol singing bear could be hit with an ASBO after receiving complaints his festive tunes were causing a noise nuisance.

Although the bear, named Bernard by staff at The Loft café in Ampthill Road, Shefford, stands outside each day bringing joy to passing children who run past him trying to make him sing and dance, it would seem he doesn’t make everyone so merry.

On Monday an enforcement officer from Central Bedfordshire Council visited the café to inform staff that there had been complaints made about Bernard’s singing because he was causing a public nuisance.

According to staff at The Loft, opened by husband and wife team Rob and Teresa Farndon in October last year, Bernard was out every day in December last year spreading some festive cheer without any complaints being made and has been put away at 4pm every night since he took up his post again two weeks ago.

Employee Abbie McGee said: “The children love him and there’s even one woman who used to put 20p in his pocket every time she went past.

“As soon as you shut the door you can’t hear him anymore, he isn’t loud. I can’t believe there have been complaints, is no-one allowed to have fun anymore? It seems really silly that someone would moan about a bear when we’re on the high street where there is constant noise from the pubs and traffic.

“He only sings Christmas songs.”

Ellen, a regular at The Loft, who has asked for her last name not to be used, said: ""Bearing in mind that he is not 'singing' loudly and actually cannot be heard in the cafe, I and a great many others in town fail to understand the problem.

""There are so many issues that do require council attention locally that I find it ludicrous that taxpayers' money is being used to effectively gag this popular 'toy'. Notwithstanding the fact that it is Christmas time and with all the serious issues people have to deal with on a daily basis its actually great to see people smiling as they walk or drive past and see him singing and dancing away.

""I fear he could end up with an ASBO and that would be more than I could bear.""

A spokesman for Central Bedfordshire Council said: “We have received one complaint regards a Christmas carol-singing bear and have visited the premises on a number of occasions and, while Bernard has not been deemed a nuisance, we have written to both parties, explaining the situation as part of an ongoing investigation. 

""The council takes noise complaints seriously and has a legal obligation to fully investigate them, but we also want everyone in Central Bedfordshire to enjoy themselves over the Christmas period and would urge residents and business owners alike to be mindful of their neighbours and the local community when planning festivities.”

Central Bedfordshire Council would like to make clear no ABSO proceedings have been brought against Bernard nor has he officially been 'gagged'."
2447,"The story of English teacher Lucita Sandoval’s affair with a 16-year-old student went viral after video allegedly showing the two having sex leaked. But the video in question is from a porn website, and features a woman and a college student, a local newspaper found.

A salacious sex tape from an Argentinian teacher’s affair with her 16-year-old student is likely nothing more than an Internet hoax.

An Argentinian newspaper debunked the racy story. While the actual tape may be real, it features a woman and a college student ― not a teacher and her pupil, Nuevo Diario reported.

The story of teacher Lucita Sandoval went viral after video allegedly showed the 26-year-old having sex with an underage student from her school in the city of Santiago del Estero. The scandalous story maintained the boy filmed her without her consent and then shared the 23-minute clip with his friends on WhatsApp.

The story rapidly spread throughout Latin America and picked up even more steam when English wire services reported it.

But the woman in the video is not a teacher ― and the “boy” is a college student, the Santiago del Estero newspaper found.

While the tape is real, it appears to be from a porn website.

The real woman who appears in the clip, identified by a friend, is from a different Argentine city, Corrientes, the newspaper reported. She does have a teaching degree, but was not employed at the school in question. The newspaper tracked down the man in the video, too, who is well over the age of 16 and in college.

It’s unclear if “Lucita Sandoval” is a real teacher who was the victim of the online hoax or an entirely made-up person."
2448,"Eleven commercial jets have reportedly been stolen in recent weeks in Libya, and Western intelligence agencies have begun warning they could be used in terror attacks on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the devastating Osama bin Laden-orchestrated attacks on New York and Washington that left nearly 3,000 dead.
According to a report in the Free Beacon, the jets were taken by Islamist militias in Libya, and reports distributed within the U.S. government “included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack … on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks …”

One official in the report assembled by the highly respected Bill Gertz said, “There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

Gertz now is senior editor of the Free Beacon, but he built his career during 27 years as reporter, editor and columnist with the Washington Times. He’s also authored six books and his online biography reveals the state-run Xinhua news agency in 2006 identified him as the No. 1 “anti-China expert” in the world.

His report about the missing jetliners notes authorities have a high level of concern because of the convergence of the cases of missing airplanes and the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.

It also is just two years after the Sept. 11 terror attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, a scandal that still is reverberating through the Obama administration and threatening to become a game-changer for the 2014 elections.

Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in that attack.

What do YOU think? Do you fear for America’s safety? Sound off in today’s WND poll.

A State Department official declined comment, Gertz reported.

The officials quoted by Gertz said U.S. intelligence agencies now are trying to locate all the airplanes belonging to two Libyan airline companies, and they have not confirmed the aircraft theft, which reportedly happened after the takeover by terrorists of Tripoli International Airport in August.

“The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s,” the report said. “Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.”

The report blames Libyan Dawn, one of the terror organizations operating there, for the alleged thefts in late August.

Following the warnings from Western intelligence agencies, Tunisia halted flights from Tripoli, Sirte and Misrata because of the potential the jets would appear in suicide missions, the report said.

And Egypt halted flights to and from Libya.

Gertz said military components from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt were put on a higher level of alert.

Libya has been an uncontrolled disaster area since the Obama administration engineered the removal in 2011 of strongman Muammar Gadhafi from office. His departure left terror factions struggling for control as the nation plunged into chaos.

Both Libyan Dawn and another group called Ansar al-Shariah were declared by Libya’s parliament to be terror groups. The report said Ansar al-Shariah reportedly has surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenades, among other weapons.

Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, explained to Al Jazeera broadcasting that “credible intelligence” reports say the jets are intended for use by a group called Masked Men Brigade for attacks on the 9/11 date.

Gertz reported that a counterterrorism expert, Sebastian Gorka, explained the events that could develop with the stolen jets.

“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” he said.

“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.

Gertz’s report noted the planes themselves become an agent of destruction.

“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes?” asked Michael Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute. “Even empty, but loaded up with fuel, they can be as devastating.”"

He was 39 years old.

The (extremely disturbing) video can be viewed here. @Mujahid4life tweeted stills from it, which are (aside from the one below), sickeningly graphic.

The Global Post reported the circumstances of his disappearance last year, after attempting to keep the news quiet for fear of Foley's safety:

Foley had set off toward the border in a car about an hour before his capture. A witness, a Syrian, later recounted over the phone to a journalist in Turkey that an unmarked car intercepted Foley. The witness said men holding kalashnikovs shot into the air and forced Jim out of the car.

The witness said he noticed nothing that would indicate whether the aggressors were rebel fighters, individuals looking for a ransom, members of a pro-government militia, or a religious-based group with other motivations.
He was held captive for 635 days.

In 2013, Foley's family set up a Find James Foley website for him, which states that he's the oldest of five children. His friend, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote about him for Syria Deeply last year:

2454,"A woman who claims to be the girlfriend of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps revealed in a Facebook post that she was born intersex, a fact she has not previously revealed to Phelps, among others.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, 41, wrote a lengthy post describing her early life, saying that at birth she had male genitalia with no testicles as well as a uterus, without ovaries. Born David Roy Fitch, she writes that she went on testosterone blockers and changed her name to Paige Victoria Whitney in her teens, then had surgery when she was in her 20s. She writes in a post she put up Nov. 13:

“By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery. …

“The problem is I have made friends that I never told and dated and married people that knew nothing of my past,” she writes. “If you don’t understand what intersex is, Google it. I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.”

According to the Intersex Society of America:

A general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male. For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside. Or a person may be born with genitals that seem to be in-between the usual male and female types.

Chandler, who writes that she thinks her revelation may cause Phelps to terminate their relationship, claims on a Facebook page filled with photos of Phelps that she met the 29-year-old swimmer on Tinder and said their relationship was “like a teenage love affair” and that they attended a Baltimore Ravens game on their first date. Phelps has not commented on the post and spent the month of October in rehab after his DUI arrest in September. He is serving a six-month suspension by U.S. Swimming and his DUI trial in Baltimore is set for Dec. 19.


On Wednesday, she wrote: “Heard from Michael he is out of rehab and back home” and added that she is frustrated with how her story is being reported.

The 40-year-old English actor is in talks to play the charismatic tech genius who gave the world the iMac, the iPod and the iPhone in Sony's upcoming biopic, The Times has confirmed. The Hollywood Reporter broke the news.

Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Trainspotting"") is directing the film, which may be called ""Jobs,"" from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who won a screenwriting Oscar for the Facebook drama ""The Social Network"" (released by Sony in 2010). Sorkin's screenplay is based on Walter Isaacson's bestselling biography ""Steve Jobs,"" acquired by Sony around the time of Jobs' death in October 2011.

The film has had a few twists and turns: Leonardo DiCaprio previously circled the Jobs role but ultimately passed, and ""Gone Girl"" director David Fincher was in talks to helm the film at one point.

Even with Bale, the Jobs biopic still faces questions, particularly over whether audiences will continue to be fascinated by Jobs. While no doubt a towering, relevant figure in both technology and culture, those two areas are characterized by swiftly moving currents, and it remains to be seen where mass interest lies when the film eventually comes out.

Rather than take a traditional cradle-to-grave approach, Sorkin said at a 2012 Newsweek and Daily Beast event that the ""entire movie is going to be three scenes, and three scenes only, that all take place in real time."" He added, ""Each of these three scenes is going to take place before a product launch — backstage before a product launch.

However, it was not all fun for Saudis after a religious scholar said that building snowmen or snow animals was not acceptable in Islam.
The fatwa, by Mohammad Saleh Al Minjed, said that building snowmen or any replica of an animal, even if it is for fun or recreation, could not be condoned. Only lifeless things, such as ships, fruit and buildings could be imitated, the fatwa said.

No date was mentioned about when the fatwa was issued, but it was widely circulated on social networks, triggering a wide and often heated online debate mainly among Gulf nationals.
Those who supported the fatwa said that building snowmen was a crude imitation of the West.

“It has no value in our traditions, and those who are fascinated by the West should emulate their inventions and sciences, not their culture,” a blogger said, Al Marsad news site reported on Monday.
However, Mishaal, an angry blogger, blasted the fatwa.

According to reports, an iPhone game designer decided he had had enough with his job and his boss, so instead of placing a letter of resignation on the higher-up’s desk, he decided to put the letter at the end of a game he helped design called Electric Boogie. The letter of resignation can reportedly only be accessed if the user gets 100 points on the final level, but the effort to see it is well worth it.

Best gift ever? Riquelme placed bank documents inside the folded envelope along with his brief note

Tears of joy: The app developer's parents burst into tears in reaction to their son's generosity

The touching video, which has been viewed nearly 130,000 times in the last 24 hours, and counting, begins with Joe Riquelme sitting on a couch with his parents and their pet dog.

Looking visibly nervous and struggling to keep his emotions in check, Riquelme tells his mom and dad that he has one more Christmas gift for them: a slightly dog-eared envelope folded in half.

Inside, there are documents from Bank of America accompanied by a handwritten note that reads: 'Your house is paid off. Merry Xmas. - Joe.'

In the corner, Riquelme drew a box with a list of three things his parents had done for their family with check marks next to each one: raising kids, college loans, mortgage.

Confronted with the note, Riguelme's mother covers her mouth in shock and bursts into tears of joy mingled with laughter as her son labors to keep his composure.

The overwhelmed woman then passes the envelope to her husband, who also begins to weep.

‘I love you. Thank you, Papi,' Riquelme's mom exclaims through sobs while showering him with hugs and kisses.

2463,"ABUJA, Nigeria — The leader of Nigeria's Islamist extremist group dashed hopes for the release of 200 kidnapped girls Saturday, denying reports of a truce with the government.

In a new video message, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau says the schoolgirls have converted to Islam and married off. ""The issue of the girls is long forgotten because I have long ago married them off,"" he says, laughing.

The news goes counter to what the Nigerian government said nearly two weeks ago when it announced a cease-fire deal with the terrorist organization, raising hopes among the families of the kidnapped girls — who were taken from the northeastern Nigerian town of Chibok in April — that their daughters would soon be released.

But as the weeks dragged on with no sign of the kidnapped girls, hopes began to fade.

""I was very excited when I heard the news — I will finally reunite with my daughter,"" said Hamidah Amira, 36, whose 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped. But then desperation set in, especially as Boko Haram abducted dozens of young women and teenagers in northeast Nigeria and continued to launch attacks that forced hundreds to flee.

Despite those incidents, the government insisted negotiations with the Islamists were ongoing in Chad, as some began to raise doubts a cease-fire was even agreed upon by the group.

Martin Ewi, senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies' office in Pretoria, said he didn't think Boko Haram had agreed to a truce, citing the lack of public statements on the issue in the past two weeks.

""The government might be talking to one faction … and then you have the other factions which might not have bought into the idea of dialogue,"" he said.

Human Rights Watch estimates Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden,"" has abducted around 500 young women over the past five years.

Although some girls managed to escape from the Islamists, the whereabouts and the fate of the rest of the young women are uncertain.

A recent Human Rights Watch report, based on interviews with victims and witnesses of Boko Haram abductions, offers rare insight into a series of physical and sexual abuses the girls suffer in captivity, including rape, forced labor and beating.

""We found that the Nigerian government has never interviewed these girls, never really found out or learned what they've gone through, never attempted to do any kind of investigations,"" said Rona Peligal, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Africa Division. ""They were kind of left on their own.""

Chibok resident Solomon Ali is deeply critical of the government's handling of the situation since the beginning.

""We were disappointed that the government has done nothing to ensure these girls are released,"" he said, adding officials have failed to keep the community informed.

Outraged by the kidnappings and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram, the international community has urged the Nigerian government to step up its efforts to free the girls. Since April, a campaign under the motto ""Bring Back Our Girls"" went viral on social media.

Peligal says Nigerian authorities should do a better job responding to the Boko Haram threat and ensuring protection around schools.

""The government needs to better anticipate and plan for those kinds of abductions because they're continuing,"" she said. ""And the government should respond capably.""

Ewi worries the girls would not be freed unless the government yields to Boko Haram's demands to release some of their militants.

""You can't pursue military operations and still be hoping to release the girls alive,"" he said.

Analysts warn the situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead of the 2015 election. Earlier this week, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is under increasing scrutiny for his failure to locate the girls, confirmed he would be running for re-election.

""The Boko Haram issue has been indeed politicized, and I expect it would be further politicized as we get closer to the election,"" said Peligal.

In the meantime, Amira — like other moms — waits, while making a personal appeal to Boko Haram to release her daughter and the other girls.

""They should sympathize with us, not with the government,"" Amira said.

2468,"Fear not, the street artist is still roaming free, spray can in hand

Banksy has not been arrested, despite a report stating the contrary.

“The Banksy arrest is a hoax,” the street artist’s publicist, Jo Brooks, told The Independent.

However, the prank seems to have duped the internet, with his name quickly trending on Twitter.

A false story, published on US website National Report, alleged that the identity of the British street artist had finally been revealed and he had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police and is being held “without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting”.

The story claimed that Banksy’s London art studio had been raided, where “thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism” were found, along with ID thought to belong to the famed anonymous street artist, which allegedly identified him as Liverpool-born Paul Homer.

However, a quick google search shows that the quotes were originally published in 2013 on hoax website on PRLog.

Nonetheless, the joke struck a nerve with Louise Mensch, who fell wholeheartedly for the ‘news’ and chastised the police for arresting the street artist and not focusing on other more pressing issues.

You have to be kidding me, @metpoliceuk. Banksy? There are so many criminals out there, Banksy? The great artist?

After she was notified that the report was, in fact, a prank, she quickly apologised to the police.

OK. Apparently it's bullshit. Sorry @metpoliceuk #Banksy

Fear not world, Banksy is still roaming free, spray can in hand."
2469,"The United States appears to now be flying unarmed surveillance drones over the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria. The pictures thus far suggest that the drone being used is the Predator. The two photos show the distinct downward facing V-shaped tail used on Predator drones, and the aircraft does not appear to be carrying any missiles. As such, the available evidence indicates that the drone is being used for surveillance purposes, rather than in a hunter-killer type mission.
According to local activists, the drone has been circling over the city for three hours. If the reports are true, this would suggest that the air environment over Raqqa is permissive. Drones are visible on radar and easy to shoot down with air defense systems. The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery – and possibly signals intelligence (SIGINT) – of Islamic State positions in the group’s most important stronghold. There is little doubt that this mission is intended to give US policymakers more information about IS positions in Raqqa. However, it does not necessarily signal the imminent use of force against IS positions in Syria.
As of now, there is no information about where the drones are based. However, open-source information allows for some informed guesses. The United States currently bases Predator drones in Turkey at Incirlik Air Force Base. The three drones are routinely flown over Northern Iraq and data is shared in real time with the Turkish military.
A second option could be that the drones are being flown from Kuwait. Satellite imagery captured the deployment of US drones at Ali Salem Air Base.

A third option is that the United States is now flying drones from an airbase in Iraqi Kurdistan.

2470,"The mystery surrounding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a Workers' Party anniversary celebration.

It was the first time in three years Kim hadn't attended the event in Pyongyang, which today marked the party's 69th anniversary.

But while Kim wasn't there in person, a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, both of whom also ruled North Korea.

Kim Jong Un was absent from the Workers' Party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang today, but a flower basket baring his name was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, as were other baquets from North Koreans

North Korean military personnel march as they visit the statues of late leaders, Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il on Mansudae, as they mark the anniversary celebrations

It was the first time in three years, Kim hadn't attended the event amid reports his sister has taken over leadership as he recovers from a leg injury

North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo-jong (left), who has already been identified as Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has reportedly taken leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury

His absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury.

The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that.

An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill.

In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week.

State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover.

North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say.

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship previously said

Because Pyongyang is publicly acknowledging Kim's 'discomfort', many analysts believe that he's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious. When his father, Kim Jong Il, suffered major health problems late in his rule, state media said nothing.

But each day that passes only adds to the speculation. Kim missed a meeting of the country's parliament late last month, and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father's election as ruling party head.

Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, appeared to suggest Ms Kim had taken control.

He told The Telegraph: 'Kim's sister may be young, but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in North Korea, relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out.

'No-one can touch the Kim family and it doesn't matter that she is young, inexperienced and a woman. She is a Kim and that's enough.'

According to South Korea's JoongAng Daily, Ms Kim is already in charge of her brother's daily schedule, 'as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style'.

Health fear: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011

Prior to the emergence of the latest claims, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership insisted Kim was in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over his health and grip on power.

The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury.

'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.

'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight.

'He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

He was last seen attending a concert with his wife Ri Sol-ju on September 3 but has vanished from public since

Kim has not been pictured by state media, which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail, since September 3

'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.

Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.

The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.

'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.

North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.

Shots fired across border after activists urge North Korea to rise up against 'dictator' Kim

North and South Korea exchanged machinegun fire today after the Communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un.

No casualties were reported in the exchange of fire, a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states.

They remain legally at war and are separated by the Demilitarized Zone, known as the DMZ.

North Korean defectors launched balloons from the South today to send across leaflets and DVDs condemning the regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as American dollars

The balloons carried bags of leaflets and anti-Kim DVDs underneath. But they prompted North Korean border troops to fire across the border, which led to an exchange of fire

South Korean activists had sent leaflets critical of the North Korean regime flying into the North from the town, prompting shots to be fired by the North's guards to try to bring down the balloons.

South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said.

Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said.

There was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later, he added.

Local residents of Hwangsan-ri township in the border area of Yeoncheon were evacuated to shelters as a precaution.

While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare.

In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict.

The balloon launch from Hapsuri was one of several planned to coincide with North Korea's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party.

Seoul allowed the exercises to go ahead, despite prior warnings from Pyongyang of 'catastrophic' consequences.

Some of the balloons carried messages denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, who has not seen seen in public for more than a month.

North Korea has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by South Korean private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in Pyongyang, vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat.

'This is the first time North Korea actually took an action against leaflets. It spilt cold water over the South-North relationship after the high-level delegation visit from North. It will strain the relations again,' said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said.

On Tuesday, a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula's west coast and fired shots back before retreating, a South Korean defence official said.

There were no casualties on the South Korean side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other's vessel, he told Reuters.

Evidence of the shots fired by North Korea could be seen on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone which separates the two states, including this bullet hole (centre). Both sides are technically still at war"
2471,"Gill Rosenberg is reported to have been captured with several other women fighting with Kurds

There is “no hard evidence” that Isis has captured a Canadian-Israeli woman fighting with the Kurds in Syria, an expert has said, as officials struggle to discover the truth of militants’ claims the woman is just one of a group of female fighters to have been kidnapped near Kobani.

Gill Rosenberg, 31, is a Canadian-born woman and resident of Tel Aviv who volunteered to fight alongside Kurdish fighters in Syria.

According to a blog linked to Isis (also known as Islamic State), which has been quoted by Israeli media reports, Ms Rosenberg was captured alongside several female fighters near Kobani. These reports have not yet been confirmed by Israeli officials, and the Canadian foreign ministry has said it is “pursuing all appropriate channels” to confirm Ms Rosenberg’s whereabouts.

“I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Ya’alon told an Israeli television channel when asked about the reports.

Charlie Winter, a researcher at counter-extremism think tank Quilliam, said that while the rumours swirl around the state of Ms Rosenberg’s capture, there is “no hard evidence” to show that she has been taken by Isis.

“No photos of her have been circulated by Isis,” Mr Winter said, “which means there is no hard evidence that she has actually been captured. At the same time, the YPG have denied the rumours, and the Free Syrian Army’s representatives in Kobani said the rumours haven’t been confirmed to them either.”

Mr Winter said despite the lack of physical evidence, the YPG and the Free Syrian Army are “not above deliberate obfuscation to make Isis look weaker,” but that it is impossible to know the truth without any official pictures or statements.

Others have refuted rumours of Ms Rosenberg’s kidnap however, claiming that she simply has no internet access and will be updating her status on Facebook as soon as she had a connection.

Oliver Brimo, who appears to be a friend of Ms Rosenberg, posted on her Facebook profile on Monday: “To those who are concerned about Gill Rosenberg’s safety. Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause she has no internet access. Once she has internet access she will be updating her status [sic].”

He added: “Isis’s supporters launched a rumour on social media that she was captured in #Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300km from Kobani [sic].”

Mr Brimo told The Independent on Monday that his source claims to have seen Ms Rosenberg ""in person hours ago"".

On 20 November, Ms Rosenberg posted that her Facebook page and friend requests were to be managed by someone else until she had access again, which she expected to happen approximately two weeks later, around the second week of December.

Messages of concern have flooded her Facebook page since the claims emerged of her kidnapping.

Ms Rosenberg is a former member of the Israel Defence Force. A source linked to the YPG, the Kurds’ dominant fighting force in northern Syria, told Reuters News Agency in November that Ms Rosenberg was their first female foreign recruit and had crossed into Syria to fight Isis.

Tim Cook told an Apple Store employee in Germany that he wears his Apple Watch with him in the shower, without any problem, according to a report from French site iGen. Considering how busy Cook is, his watch habit makes sense to stay on top of the time and any important notifications.

The Watch’s ability to survive in water isn’t surprising, since it’s designed as a workout accessory in addition to something people wear around town. The device has to be at least somewhat resistant to human sweat, and in protecting it against that kind of moisture, it makes sense that Apple’s engineers would make it showerproof as well.

Apple hasn’t claimed that it’s fully waterproof, which may make it less appealing to swimmers, divers and other people who want their timepieces to survive an extended dip in the water. There’s also the matter of the Watch’s battery life: Cook said that he has to take it off every night to charge.

It won’t be long until consumers will be able to try out all of that for themselves. Cook revealed last month that the watch will be available for sale in April."
2473,"Kim Yo-jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, might be leading the hermit kingdom instead of her brother, a recent report from Seoul-based think tank, North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity (NKIS) revealed.

According to NKIS on October 1, Kim Jong-un — who has failed to appear at official events since early September — is getting medical treatment at Bonghwa Clinic from both domestic and foreign medical teams. Meanwhile, in his absence,  Kim Yo-jong is charged with handling important government decisions.

An unnamed source told NKIS that a decision to give Kim Jong-un extended medical treatment was made at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea on September 6. The meeting was reportedly held at Kim Yo-jong’s suggestion.

As a result of the meeting, Pyongyang decided four things. First, to give special and extended medical treatment to Kim Jong-un in order to quickly restore his health. Second, all North Korean high level officials and party members should be responsible in following Kim’s previous orders. Third, the party and army should be on wartime-like alert while Kim Jong-un is out of commission. Lastly, all the important matters related to government administration should be reported to Kim Yo-jong, so that Kim Jong-un can concentrate on getting better.

Kim Yo-jong is the daughter of the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and his wife, Kim Yong-hui. She was first spotted at a photo session for participants at the 3rd Conference of the Workers’ Party of Korea in September 2010, when she stood next to her father’s personal secretary.

She was officially mentioned for the first time on March 9, 2014, as she accompanied her brother in voting for the Supreme People’s Assembly. She was identified as a “senior official” of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. She is widely seen as having taken over the role of her aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, the wife of the executed Jang Song-thaek. Kim Kyong-hui supported her elder brother Kim Jong-il during his rule.

“Some say Hwang Byong-so, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People’s Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo-jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,” said Kim Heung-gwang, the head of NKIS.

Meanwhile, speculation over Kim Jong-un’s sustained absence continues unabated.

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported, citing an unnamed source, that he is suffering from gout.

A Daily Mirror report said that Kim Jong-un is addicted to Swiss cheese, which may have contributed to his health problems.

Curtis Melvin, a researcher with the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, told Foreign Policy that Kim Jong un spends much of his time at the family compounds in Wonsan and Kangdong. The family compound in Kangdong is where Kim Jong-il recovered from his stroke.

In addition, Free North Korea Radio (FNK) reported on September 29 that Kim hadsurgery on his ankle. The surgery was reportedly successful.

However, the South Korean government has refused to confirm that Kim is suffering from any health problem.

“I think it is hard to relate Kim’s absence to his health since there used to be a time when Kim disappeared from official events [for] over ten days,” said Lim Byeong-chul, a spokesman of the Ministry of Unification."

2477,"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.

Where is Kim Jong Un?

The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.

But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.

Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.

Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.

""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.

After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.

He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""

Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.

Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.

""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.

Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.

2478,"The fungi was found by TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh

A hallucinogenic toadstool mushroom is growing in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.

The red and white spotted Amanita muscaria species - also known as fly agaric - has been discovered by Alan Titchmarsh while on tour of the grounds with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

The discovery of the mushroom - which is likely to have grown on the 40-acre land without being specifically cultivated - was recorded during a 12-month study for ITV show The Queen's Garden, which is to be aired on Christmas Day.

Mr Titchmarsh asks Professor Crawley if the fungi is edible, to which he replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic effects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all the high without any of the sickness.”

Mr Titchmarsh, known for presenting BBC gardening programme Ground Force and the annual RHS Chelsea Flower Show, then says: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to some normal mushrooms”.

“Not something to try at home,” he added.

Chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid found in the fungi cause psychoactive effects such as drowsiness, hallucinations, mood changes, euphoria and disassociation.

The plant has a long history of religious and shamanic use dating back around 10,000 years.

However, unlike psilocybin mushrooms - which were reclassified to Class A in 2006 and have been more popular for recreational use - the legal status of selling fly agaric in the UK remains complicated. Possession is not illegal.

The physical effects are described as ""undesirable"" and the chemicals can carry risks of poisoning and death, according to drug advice charity Talk to Frank.

The mushrooms are culturally depicted in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers video games and in Disney's musical production Fantasia."
2479,"A NUN in Italy was rushed to hospital with stomach pains only to discover she was pregnant and about to give birth.

Italian media reports that the nun, 31, originally from South America, was part of the all-female convent in Macerata.

She is believed to have been pregnant when she arrived from South America in June.

Doctors performed an ultrasound only to discover that the woman was heavily pregnant. She was taken to the delivery room where she gave birth to a healthy baby boy soon after.

The Archbishop of Camerino-San Severino said it up to the unidentified sister if she wanted to stay within the Church. It has been reported that the nuns want to help raise the baby together at the convent

He also dismissed calls for the nun to be excommunicated, saying: “Excommunication is something really big and cannot be issued for having a baby.”"
2480,"A tour of the royal grounds at Buckingham Palace went through the looking glass when so-called “magic mushrooms” were found in the garden, The Telegraph reports .

The discovery was made while a television crew was touring the gardens in preparation for an ITV television show called The Queen’s Garden, which will air on Christmas day. While taping the show gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh and ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley noticed some red and white spotted fungi. Titchmarsh asked, “Is it edible?” and, according to The Telegraph, Professor Crawley replied, “That depends what you mean.”

The fungus found in the Queen’s garden was a naturally occurring Amanita muscaria (no one suspects Queen Elizabeth II of cultivating the magic mushroom) that according to Prof. Crawley is “eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.” The fungus, commonly known as fly agaric or fly mushroom, does have hallucinogenic properties, but it is not the same as the illicit psychoactive mushroom that contains the illegal drug psilocybin. Still, Titchmarsch wisely replied, “I won’t be eating any of that.” Titchmarsh told The Sun that he was surprised to happen upon the red and white-headed toadstool, “That was a surprise, but it shows just how varied the species are.”

Palace officials said Friday there are several hundred species of mushrooms growing in the palace gardens, including a number of the Amanita muscaria. It is understood that the mushrooms grew naturally in the palace grounds rather than having been planted there. Palace officials made it clear to the AP that mushrooms from the garden are not used in the palace kitchens."
2481,"An audio recording released Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer Aug. 9.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organization Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organization's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

A press conference is set for 1 p.m. CT Tuesday at the U.S. District court building in St. Louis.

A spokeswoman for the charity said it has received dozens of calls from members of the public offering Kai a new home.

“The phone’s been ringing off the hook all day. We’ve had over 100 offers to take him on. It’s really unusual to get that sort of interest,” the SSPCA said.

@ScottishSPCA is Kai still available for adoption? located in Canada but love the breed and will pay any necessary costs to have him come.

“Normally, when we get an abandonment, it’s usually a staffie and we don’t tend to get many offers to re-home them, but when it’s an unusual breed or a particularly cute one, then we get a lot of interest.

“I’m sure Kai’s story has tugged at a lot of heartstrings.”

2485,"Although Apple has given us our first peek at the Apple Watch, so far we don’t know much about it, including when it will be released or how much its many versions will cost.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

As for shipping date, iGen.fr’s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date. That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine’s Day present right now, isn’t it?"
2489,"Sorry to disappoint, fans of Led Zeppelin, but it doesn’t look like a reunion will be happening any time soon.

According to a report from UK publication The Mirror, the group’s famed lead singer Robert Plant literally tore up a contract to reunite the band worth almost $800 million, saying the timing just wasn’t right for a reunion tour.

Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin brand fame was apparently behind the entire thing, offering the band an obscene amount of money just to reunite for a few dozen shows. The contract was reportedly for 35 shows in three cities: London, Berlin, and an unnamed location in New Jersey. Each of the three remaining original members would have earned somewhere over $200 million each just for performing, while another $100 million in merchandising profits was to be shared between the group members.

English: Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin

Branson was reportedly also ready to supply the group with their own private jet for the tour. The mogul was prepared to take one of his airline’s planes and rebrand it “The Starship”. The contract also had an extension option to add 45 more shows in additional venues should the band agree.

The other two original members of the group apparently signed on immediately, and Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John Bonham, was set to step in for his father. Plant apparently met with conert promoters to discuss the deal, and during the meeting actually ripped the contract in two, ending any chance of a regrouping.


While $800 million is certainly a lot of money, it’s not like Robert Plant (or any of the other members for that matter) really need it. Led Zeppelin are one of the most successful groups of all time, having sold around 112 million records in the United States alone (that figure is three or four times that when the entire planet is counted). In fact, they are the fourth best-selling music act in American history, right behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Garth Brooks.

Robert Plant has also had an incredibly successful career outside of Led Zeppelin. He has released fourteen albums, selling additional millions and making his chart history that much more impressive. His collaborative album Raising Sand with bluegrass/country singer Alison Krauss may not have been his most commercially successful, but it was adored universally by critics, and won he, Alison, and producer T-Bone Burnett five Grammys back in 2009, including Record of the Year and Album of the Year.

While the band’s last album of original music, Coda, was released back in 1982, the band has continued to sell well throughout the years, making millions in repackagings, reissues and live album releases. The group’s last show together was in London back in December of 2007, which was a tribute to legendary music executive Ahmet Ertegün. The concert is thought to have had the most-desired tickets of any show in history, as when it was announced, 20 million requests were submitted online for passes."
2490,"While other global leaders rant their exasperations and anger towards the extremists ISIS fighters and its entire caliphate, one leader may just take matters in his own hands. Jordan's King Abdullah II, visibly shaken and angered over the death of one of his kingdom’s military pilots, has vowed to exact revenge. Reports in Arabic-language newspapers hinted he may don his pilot suit and drop the bombs himself.

Photos have emerged over the Internet of a poker-faced Jordan King Abdullah II who was wearing a fatigue green army uniform. The reports emerged after the Jordanian leader vowed a relentless war against the ISIS right on their own territory. The portal dailycaller said the king leader, a trained pilot, “may fly a bomber himself on Thursday.”

The news of the burning of Jordanian pilot First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS happened while the king was in the U.S. King Abdullah is a strong ally of Washington and London. Al-Kasasbeh got captured when the F-16 fighter he was flying crashed over the jihadi Syrian headquarters in Raqqa in December. He had been burned alive in a cage by the terrorist army. In a closed-door meeting with U.S. lawmakers following the video’s release, King Abdullah II said the ISIS will see a retribution it hasn’t seen before.

Safi al-Kaseasbeh, the pilot's father, said earlier the 53-year-old monarch had personally attended to the coordination for the release of his son, which had ended in vain. “The King told me that he was following up personally on Muath’s case,"" the grieving father told the Jordan Times. ""He said Crown Prince Hussein, may God protect him, is no dearer to me than Muath.” The younger al-Kaseasbeh had graduated from King Hussein Air College, the academy named for Abdullah's father.

King Abdullah said they will pursue the black-clad terrorist army until they ran “out of fuel and bullets.” Quoting lines from the ‘Unforgiven,’ a movie led by American actor Clint Eastwood, he said the death of one of Jordan’s sons will call not only for the death of his killers, but also their “wives and all their friends, and burn his damn house down.”

Duncan Hunter, California Republican Rep., told the Washington Examiner that King Abdullah II has called his officials to arrange “more sorties than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow.” Mohammad Momani, Jordanian government spokesman, quoted by Fox News, said the country’s response to the assassination “...will be swift. Jordanians’ wrath will devastate Daesh’s ranks.”

""All the State's military and security agencies are developing their options. Jordan's response will be heard by the world at large but this response on the security and military level will be announced at the appropriate time,"" Momani said.

Jon Alterman, director of the Center for Strategic & International Studies' Middle East Program, told Fox News that Jordan’s words were not just mere lip service or emotional outbursts. ""Their ability to do difficult things with small numbers of highly trained people is up there with some of the best militaries in the world.""

David Schenker, former adviser to Defense Secretary Donald Rumseld and director of the Arab politics program at The Washington Institute, said Jordan's military force, ""regionally speaking, they are people of high quality.""

2492,"SAN SEVERINO - Go to the hospital accusing a terrible stomach ache and comes out clutching their arms a pretty baby. It would just be a story with a happy ending, a birth like many, one that comes from the lanes of the department of obstetrics and gynecology of ""Bartolomeo Eustachio"" San Severino Marche were it not for the fact that the protagonist of the race to the hospital this time it was a new mother any but a nun who had sworn, years ago, chastity to the Lord with eternal fidelity.
She had arrived at the hospital, accompanied by her sisters, from the emergency room. Exactly complained of stomach pains but ultrasound has revealed the mystery and the doctor on duty invited nun and sisters to immediately take the road of the department of obstetrics not without a moment of embarrassment. Amniotic sac broke and team immediately into action to deliver the nun. In the story, of course, little is known about the same even if it took him nothing to go around the country and come out not only dall'ovattato silence ensured by medical and nursing staff who witnessed the happy event but also from that, more religious in this case, the convent which would seem to be even a cloistered monastery in the area (in San Severino there are two, the monastery of St. Catherine and the St. Clare, both in the area of Catsello). Nothing leaked, of course, on the identity of religious, nor on physical features of the infant. Mystery over whether resembles more the mother rather than the father. And if you do not ask to be born was a boy or a girl as in lane embarrassments are palpable. We only know that the mother of the unborn child, the original of a state in South America, would arrive in Macerata for some time and would find accommodation, perhaps refuge in a cloistered in our province. It is also hard to say whether the sister has or less confessed his sin, not venial, to his superior. We know, however, that the religious would come first to the emergency room, and later would bring up the ward, accompanied by other sisters who, even before a miracle, they entrusted the prayer of the Lord who in the meantime was to come to light. The entrance to the acceptance took place Sunday and was, however, a great day of celebration for the arrival of a new life. So, really embarrassed general, were followed by the team that performed the childbirth exciting phases that accompanied the same. No flowers at the entrance of the bedroom which these days has ensured the anonymity that the new mother , however, seems to have decided to keep the small and that maybe now will be transferred elsewhere, probably in a family home. Certainly before Sunday the nun would not be left unattended, this is what I would tell her that the religious have shared cloistered in recent months. And certainly in the structure that housed it, the nun could hardly have had contact with the outside world. Although the ways of the Lord, you know, are really endless. Not surprised, months ago, the news of the birth of another sister, this time the Congolese. The child came to light was first given to a pair of Tolentino and then taken to the adoptive parents with an unexpected and unexpected measure of the Supreme Court finally entrusted to a halfway house. In that case the natural mother had abandoned the little girl, at birth . The child for two and a half years had been grown by two new parents that if the view were then subtract."
2495,"Islamic State militants appear to have killed missing American journalist James Wright Foley, if a video that surfaced Tuesday is to be believed. 

Foley was a freelancer who frequently reported for the Global Post and Agence France-Presse about ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. When Foley first disappeared in Syria, reports indicated that he had been captured by pro-government forces. Instead, it appears that his captors were members of ISIS. He had previously been kidnapped in Libya. 

The video that surfaced Tuesday first shows a clip from President Obama's press conference calling for air strikes against ""the terrorist group ISIL."" About halfway in, a man believed to be Foley speaks in English to his family. He's on his knees, with an ISIS guard standing over him. In a [likely ISIS-scripted] speech, he blames Obama and the U.S. government for his impending death and implores his family not to take a penny from the government. He then addresses his brother, John, who is in the U.S. Air Force. 

""I died that day, John,"" he says, referring to U.S. air strikes against the militant group. ""When your colleagues dropped that bomb on those people, they signed my death certificate.""

When the video reorients itself to focus back on Foley and his executioner, the mike previously hooked up to his shirt is gone. The militant spouts off an angry tirade against the United States, and the camera cuts away after the first few seconds of the beheading. 

At the end of the video, ISIS militants parade another captive journalist, Steven Sotloff, who they threaten will be the next victim if the U.S. government's policy toward the militant group doesn't change.

The video was taken down from Youtube shortly after it was publicized. A HuffPo blogger who claimed to have shared the video apologized for doing so:

As of November 2013, at least 30 journalists were being held captive in Syria. Many more have been killed in the ongoing conflict."

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he could not stop the bleeding.

And the jilted lover was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade.

The bloody penis was delivered to the local hospital but a surgeon skilled enough to carry out the reattachment couldn't be found.

Ilic was then transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje, where surgeons managed to reattach the penis in a complicated five-hour surgery.

They said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis.

Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away.

2497,"If 9to5Mac’s latest findings are true, than Apple’s biggest product of the year could be the MacBook Air. (You know, right behind the Apple Watch.) According to early reports, Apple has completely redesigned the MacBook Air, ditching the full-sized USB port, MagSafe connector, and SD card slots for something entirely different.

9to5Mac’s Mark Gurman writes: “The 12-inch MacBook Air will be considerably smaller than the current 13-inch version, yet also slightly narrower than the 11-inch model. The new 12-inch version is approximately a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, yet it is also a quarter-of-an-inch taller in order to accommodate the slightly larger display. In order to fit the larger screen into a footprint about the size of the current 11-inch model, the bezels on the display have been reduced on all sides.”

profilecompare copy
9to5Mac's artist Michael Steeber designed renditions of what the new Air could look like. Here's a side view of the rumored 12-inch Air (left) compared to the current 11-inch Air (right).

Why this matters: We already have an 11-inch MacBook Air... and a 13-inch, too. So, doesn’t a 12-inch just seem unnecessary? To keep up the MacBook Air’s reputation of being ultra-light and ultra-portable, it makes sense to keep the Air’s screen size at 13-inches or less. However, something smaller than 11-inches will just be too small. So, the 12-inch could actually fill that “just right” sweet spot nicely.

It’s not all about the size
However, if 9to5Mac’s design estimates are correct, this is the start of a new design shift for the MacBook Air. We’ll see features that are slimmer and more compact than before, with an edge-to-edge keyboard, a modified trackpad, and a thinner profile (yes, the Air will actually be getting smaller).

Apple could also introduce USB Type-C on the new Air, which means it would no longer need a MagSafe port, as reports on USB Type-C indicate that it can be used to power computers. 9to5Mac believes this single port could be used as a sort of hub, allowing users to plug in multiple devices to the Air.

Of course, this is just speculation at this point—Apple has yet to announce a new MacBook Air officially—but 9to5Mac’s artist renditions are pretty cool. Check out their full report for more details."

Gawker reported that the critters have made Vogue’s infamous editor-in-chief scared to enter her office without taking precautions first.

“The infestation is so acute, one source said, that the fashion title’s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, recently issued a standing order: Staffers must ensure that her personal office is rat-free before she enters it…”

A source told People that: “the girls that work there see the droppings everywhere. It’s nasty.”

The rats have also reportedly eaten holes into shoe boxes and left droppings on the floor of the accessories closet. It’s believed that Vogue’s newest office mates made their way into the office through the ventilation system.

2504,"Seven girls aged between 13 and 14 have fallen pregnant after going on a school trip in Bosnia.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision when the girls, from the town of Banja Luka, returned from a five-day trip to the capital city.

The school had taken 28 girls on the educational outing to Sarajevo to visit museums and other historical sitess, but since returning the girls have now reportedly dropped out of lessons.

Scroll down for video

The 28 schoolgirls were on a trip to the capital of Bosnia, Sarajevo (pictured), when seven returned pregnant

The case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in Bosnia, where the number of sexually active girls aged between 13 and 15 has increased significantly.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a gynaecologist from Sarajevo said that a growing trend for underage pregnancies in Bosnia is worrying.

'That is the trend of today. But we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,' he added.

He added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

'It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

'We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.'

Parents of the girls, who are from the town of Banja Luka (pictured), are demanding to know why the teachers were not providing better supervision on the trip

Young girls in Bosnia are seeking advice from experts online, the InSerba News Network has reported.

One schoolgirl wrote: 'I would have sex with my boyfriend, even though I'm only 14... But I am afraid I'll be judged.'

Last year in Sarajevo 31 underage girls became pregnant but seven out of 28 girls in one five day period has set something of a record.

The National Coordinator for Reproductive Health of the Republika Srpska, Nenad Babici, admitted more children in his country are engaging in sexual relations as early as at age of 13 or 14.

But he didn't blame the teachers for the school trip pregnancy boom - he said it was down to 'parental neglect'."
2506,"Fidel Castro was pronounced dead on Twitter sometime around 3:59 p.m. on Thursday. It was an unconfirmed rumor, of course, but it was announced confidently so many folks assumed it was true — or at least worthy of retweet.

Then separate rumors started about Raul Castro calling a press conference at 9 a.m. or 11 a.m. today, allegedly to announce his brother’s death.


As South America’s Twittersphere caught fire, some started questioning whether the users in their feed were even talking about the right Fidel Castro. After all, Al Jazeera reported on Jan. 4 that the  Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of Kenya’s main opposition leader, died in Nairobi last weekend after a night of drinking with friends. Could it be that Twitter users were confusing the dead Kenyan man with his Cuban namesake?


Twitter heatmap shows mention of “Fidel Castro” from 10 a.m. Thursday- 8 a.m today (GMT).

An overly excited Wikipedian edited the entry for Cuba’s Fidel Castro to say “this article is about a person who has recently died.” Moments later, the Castro’s Wikipedia entry was reverted back and to his undead version.

By 8 p.m., media outlets around Latin America were reporting “strong rumors” about Castro’s death and the alleged forthcoming announcement by Cuban officials.


But on the island, where folks are more accustomed to rumors of Castro’s death, the situation seemed less urgent. Journalists in Havana said they were aware of the rumors, but weren’t finding echo on the streets of Cuba. It’s true Castro hasn’t been seen in public in a year, but rumors of his death — as Mark Twain might have said — appeared to be greatly exaggerated.


As journalists turned to each other for answers, Cuba watchers tuned into state television.When Castro dies, that’s where it will be announced unequivocally."
2508,"28 girls, aged 13 and 14, from a small town went on a five-day school trip to the capital, Sarajevo. A quarter of them returned pregnant.

It wasn't a pregnancy pact.

Seven Bosnian teenagers became pregnant on a five-day school trip, angering parents and educators, according to public health officials.

The teens, from small town Banja Luka, are 13 and 14 years old, said Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health.

The school took a group of 28 girls on the trip to the capital, Sarajevo, to see museums and city sights, according to inserbia.info. A quarter of the students returned home pregnant.

Parents are demanding why there wasn't better supervision on the trip, according to the Courier Mail. But Babici said parents need to teach their children about sex.

The case has brought national attention to the increasing number of teen pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Sarajevo gynecologist Senad Mehmedbasic said the growing rate is worrisome because teens face higher risks in both pregnancy and child birth.

""We have to be more direct in the educational system,"" he said. ""It must not be allowed that the street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.""

2509,"BEIRUT — Islamic State group fighters seized at least one cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town, activists said Tuesday.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early on Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, IS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the U.S. had seen the video but couldn't confirm its accuracy and was seeking more information.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria."
2511,"The weather man was reporting from Sugar Mountain N.C. Saturday night when anchor Lester Holt said he was going to give a live report. But Seidel’s back was facing the camera and it appeared to many viewers he was answering Mother Nature’s call instead of reporting on it. But the network said he had dropped his phone in the snow and was looking for it.

The TV news weather forecast appeared to call for yellow snow — but the network says it was not so.

NBC weatherman Mike Seidel missed a live report from snow-blanketed North Carolina on Saturday night because his back was to the camera. And the way he turned around while also on camera — appearing to zip up the fly of his pants before putting his gloves back on — suggested to viewers that he had been relieving himself.

During the telecast anchor Lester Holt said hello to the No. 1 Weather Channel meteorologist who was in Sugar Mountain, but his back was turned to the camera.

Seidel's body was slightly hunched over and he was looking downward near some trees.

After a few pauses Seidel can be heard asking ""Why?"" as he starts to turn around. The weather man is holding his gloves in his hands despite the cold temperature.

As he turns he slightly moves his arm, which may have been an attempt to close an open zipper. He then hurriedly puts his gloves back on.

A network official told the Daily News that Seidel had dropped his cell phone in the snow and had turned around to find it.

Seidel has tweeted pictures of the snowstorm on his Twitter account, but did not make any mention of the incident.

2515,"Et si Dieu était une femme? C'est ce qu'affirme le père John Micheal O’neal, prêtre de 71 ans dans le Massachusetts. Le 29 janvier dernier, il est amené d’urgence à l’hôpital, victime d'une crise cardiaque. Quelques minutes après son arrivée, il est déclaré cliniquement mort. Les médecins parviennent finalement à le «ramener à la vie en redémarrant son cœur, 48 minutes après qu’il s’est arrêté, rapportent plusieurs médias américains.
Le religieux américain a prétendu avoir des souvenirs clairs de ce qui lui était arrivé pendant ces longues minutes de mort clinique. Il explique avoir eu la sensation d’être sorti de son corps, entouré par une lumière écrasante, et éprouvé un sentiment d’intense amour autour de lui. Des sensations souvent évoquées par ceux qui ont fait l’expérience de mort imminente (EMI).  
Dieu, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante»
Mais John Micheal O’neal va plus loin. Il affirme être monté au ciel et avoir rencontré le Tout-puissant. Celui-ci serait un «être de lumière», mais surtout, une «figure maternelle chaleureuse et réconfortante».
«Sa présence était à la fois immense et réconfortante», déclare le prêtre catholique. «Elle avait une voix douce et apaisante et sa présence était aussi rassurante que l'étreinte d'une mère. Le fait que Dieu soit une Sainte=Mère au lieu d'un Saint-Père ne me dérange pas, elle est tout ce que j'espérais et même plus encore».
Ces déclarations ont provoqué l’émoi dans le clergé catholique de l'archidiocèse, obligeant le cardinal Sean P. O’Malley  à faire une déclaration publique, pour expliquer que Dieu n’était pas une femme et que le père O’neal avait subi des hallucinations."
2519,"On Friday, a rumor cropped up that one of the new Batmobile vehicles had been stolen in Detroit. The story wasn’t verified, but it did end up at a couple bigger news outlets. Because who can resist the phrase “stolen Batmobile”? Thankfully it was all just a rumor, but the story did give Batman v Superman director Zack Snyder a reason to pull together some of the minor resources at his disposal for a great photo op. 

Bleeding Cool had the original rumor, and also hilariously scolded CBS for picking up the story. In an update, the site even praised the Detroit Free Press for killing the story BC created in the first place. The DFP reports:

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

So the Batmobile isn’t stolen; it hasn’t even lost a wheel. All is right in the world, except for the fact that Bats and Supes are fighting again.

All of which brings us to Zack Snyder’s most recent tweet.

2520,"Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief on Vogue magazine is allegedly displeased with the publications's new 1 World Trade Center offices. Their new workplace at the 25th and 26th floors of the building is said to be infested with rats and vermins. Moving to this new offices may be postponed until the pests are cleared away.

Reportedly, the new 1 WTC offices of Vogue magazine are being swarmed by rodents. Editor-in-child, Anna Wintour, is said to be naturally disgusted and would not step foot into the new offices until these rodents are removed.  The report details that the influential editor-in-chief already asked her staffers to clean her office before she ever set foot in there. Fortunately, Anna Wintour is not yet expected to work in the new offices until 2015. 

A Vogue employee told Gawker last Friday afternoon that the pests cannot be tolerated for work purposes. Moreover, because of the many rodents and vermins scuttling around, the editorial department of the high-caliber magazine might delay its move from the old Times Square offices. The sales and marketing departments have already moved in. The employee added that even though it may sound laughable, but the company is facing a serious concern if these creatures are not removed. The employee explains that there is a possibility that these creatures could nibble the clothing they have in the office.

This rat infestation problem is remarkable considering how excited the company seems to be about moving to their new posh premises. Before this report, Vogue had posted the move in a special online story. The company has also been steadily showing off pictures and videos of the new offices, even Anna Wintour's through Instagram.

Page Six reports that not everyone is sympathetic towards the company.

2521,"The hoax story has been circulating far and wide on Twitter and Facebook

It may feel like winter is slowly squeezing all the sunlight out of your day, but if you see any news stories claiming the Earth is headed for ‘Six Days of Total Darkness’ then don’t start stocking up on the tins of beans and torches just yet.

‘Satirical news site’ Huzlers.com has been spreading this fake story far and wide on the web this week, taking in numerous Facebook and Twitter users and encouraging them to post about what they’re going to be up to during the six days of darkness.

The story on the vaguely official looking website titled “Nasa Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014!” claims that an incoming solar storm is to blame, causing ""dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus block 90% sunlight”.

This is false. Although solar storms certainly are real phenomena (they occur due to fluctuations in the Sun’s magnetic field) they’re not like terrestrial storms that can blow up dust and dirt.

Instead they create very minor disturbances in the Earth’s magnetosphere. Historically there have been rare storms that could knock out electrical systems today, but they're mostly of the order of magnitude only likely to throw a homing pigeon slightly off course – not blot out the Sun.

However, the hoax story even drafts in some credible-sounding sources including Nasa chief Charles Bolden, who reportedly warned the public to stay calm. Some users even linked to a (real) video of Bolden talking about “emergency preparedness” – an official-sounding phrase that apparently bypasses common sense to hit the big button marked ‘PANIC’ in the brain.

In actuality Bolden recorded the video to encourage US families to think about what they would do in the event of an earthquake or hurricane – natural disasters that are a real enough threat in America.

This total-darkness hoax apparently comes in a couple of flavours (some claim that a non-existent “photon belt” is responsible for the blackout) and are so widespread that Nasa employees even had to debunk the rumours themselves back in 2012."

2524,"President Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against Islamic State militants and would “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” following the videotaped execution of an American journalist.

“Today the entire world is appalled at the brutal murder of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIL,” Obama said, using one of several acronyms for the group. The militants, who posted the video on YouTube Tuesday, said Foley’s killing was in retaliation for U.S. airstrikes in Iraq.

Obama, who spoke Wednesday morning to Foley’s parents, offered no new policy measures to confront Islamic State. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.”

Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month.

Obama could face pressure to escalate the air campaign in Iraq and increase support to U.S.-backed rebels in Syria who are fighting against the Islamic Front, as well as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Obama has resisted pleas from the Syrian rebels for U.S. heavy weapons, including portable surface-to-air missiles, as well as for American air support.

In a statement issued after the president’s remarks, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, “We must get serious about confronting this force, including by aggressively arming those battling it.”

The White House confirmed early Wednesday that U.S. intelligence had deemed the video authentic. Obama spoke in Martha’s Vineyard, where he is vacationing with his family.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native and a photojournalist working for the Boston-based Web site Global­Post, was kidnapped in northern Syria nearly two years ago while covering the civil war in Syria.

In Britain Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent.

After beheading Foley, the executioner is pictured with a second captive, identified as U.S. freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, who disappeared last year in Syria. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the executioner says.

In an interview with the BBC, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine. Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it to the speech of former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global­Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley’s mother wrote: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim,” Diane Foley wrote. “He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

“We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Praising James Foley as “an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she asked that the family’s privacy be respected.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, according to a 2013 Global­Post article, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group’s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans “in any place” in response to the airstrikes. “We will drown all of you in blood,” it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was “A Message to America” and was produced by the Islamic State’s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. “Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,” the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama’s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” he says. He asks his parents not to accept “any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.”

The prisoner also appeals to “my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,” to “think about what you are doing.”

“I wish I had more time,” he says. “I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t an American.”

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as “James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its back.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global­Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global­Post “has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,” Global­Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

Today, one of those ridiculously stupid and fake-looking hoax sites that generates random celebrity death stories once again proved that people are gullible and should have to take IQ tests to use the Internet. Looking like an MSNBC page that stopped loading in 2004, the farticle (that’s my name for these fake articles) claimed that sources were “reporting” that Guns N’ Roses frontman Axl Rose was found dead yesterday from unknown causes in his West Hollywood home.

“The home was entered by police through an open back door where a body was found in the foyer area,” read the report created by a douchebag with a presumably large, Dorito-speckled smirk on his face. While plenty of people fell for it enough for the link to start spreading on Facebook and Twitter, the sleuths at Gossip Cop quickly proved that it was fake. Probably by looking at it.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, “Sources: Guns N’ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.”

Enough people have been duped by this story to share it more than 39,000 times on social media like Facebook. Again, this is TOTALLY FAKE. MSNBC.website pulled the same trick last month with a death hoax about Macaulay Culkin. The phony Culkin story is almost identical to the phony Rose story. Don’t believe any report coming from MSNBC.website. (Via Gossip Cop)

One of these days, Rose might actually pass away and then none of us will believe it because of these stupid hoax reports. And then his funeral will be really sad when it starts raining and Slash plays a guitar solo with no shirt under his leather jacket on top of Rose’s casket, and nobody’s there to appreciate it.

2526,"Update: Since the publication of this article, several people have reported that this may be a hoax.

A 'feminist' blog from the US has caused outrage after its author apparently admitted aborting her male fetus based on her negative past experiences of men.

In an article so astounding it is difficult to believe it is actually true, 'Lana' even expresses surprise that ""many friends, and several of my own family members have completely cut off communication with me"".

The author purports to have fallen pregnant in 2012 and was overjoyed at the thought until she discovered she was to have a boy at which point she decided to have an abortion.

Read the full blog post here

Abortion based on gender is illegal in the UK but just this week religious groups wrote to MPs to support an amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act to clarify the point.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

The practise is said to still happen in the UK particularly in ethnic communities where boys are more valued than girls.

In the blog, Lana details one of the negative experiences that was so terrible she felt she could not ""bring another monster into the world"".

The story begins aboard a plane on the way to an Occupy Wall Street rally in San Francisco. A man sat next to her upon discovering where she is going says: ""B****** like you need to learn their place.""

Lana screams ""assault"" and a male attendant rushes over but refuses to do anything as no physical contact was made.

She then admits considering lying but won't move to one of the only two spare seats as they are ""both back in Economy"".

She adds: ""I was flabbergasted, and then betrayed as they recommended that I move to one of the empty seats. This left me in tears.

""I knew the only way to get away was to move seats so I did so tearfully and having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.""

Lana then goes on how pregnancy made her feel her body had betrayed her so much she experienced ""crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war"".

Her decision to abort the fetus prompted furious comments.

""I almost threw up after reading this.""

""The most disturbing part of this is what if she didn't say yes to finding out the babies gender and had the baby to realize it was a boy, what would she have had done then?""

Fact that people abort kids in western world because of gender is thoroughly sick. ""after learning my fetus was male"" http://t.co/YZCR0UDfBu

Misandry means hatred of men. Feminism means equality of genders. ""Feminist Has Abortion Because Child Was a Boy"" NO. She is a misandrist

— Jenni (@lifeofjennibeck) February 9, 2015

Since the backlash, Lana appears to have written another blog to defend her position where she claims to have received death threats as a result of the original post.

Unfortunately she misses the point about why people would be angry at her and instead reiterates her right to choose what happens to her body.

I find it hard to hate anybody, their faults are not their own, but usually rather the product of an environment or social circle they have been exposed to. I beg most of you, for your own good, take a look at yourself and decide right now if you want to spend the rest of your life angry on the internet, or if you want to fight for a woman’s right to do what she wants with her body."
2528,"Intelligence agencies hunting for identity of jihadist who murdered reporter

Reports have suggested Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, a 23-year-old from London

Abu Hussain al-Britani, 20, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, also potential match

Young men have posed with heads and 'launched cyber attacks on West'

Security sources say they are 'zeroing in' on suspected matched

Police are preparing to raid several British homes to help establish identity

Man in video known as 'John', reportedly in British group called 'the Beatles'

Theresa May poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists

Three British men waging jihad in the Middle East alongside the Islamic State (IS) have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed James Foley in a brutal propaganda video.
The men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the IS capital of Raqqa, Syria. They enter the frame as security sources say MI5 are getting closer to discovering who the executioner, known only as 'John', could be.
The fighter, who spoke with a British accent, butchered Mr Foley, an American journalist, in front of cameras, claiming it was retaliation for U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State (formerly ISIS).

A French prisoner who was held captive by 'John' says he was part of a group of British jihadists who call themselves 'The Beatles'.
Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, a former rapper from London, Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, have been mooted as identities for 'John'.
According to reports in The Sun newspaper, some of the men have similar voices, and even use similar language, to that used in the video.

Security forces have revealed that the information contained in the horrific footage has allowed them to 'zero in' on the wanted man. 
Meanwhile, police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons in order to help establish his identity, according to a report in The Times. Their drive to find 'John' comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Bary, one of the British jihadists, has posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed heard of a Syria soldier, accompanied by a joke.

Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The jihadist, real name Junaid Hussian, later left for Syria, where it has been reported that he is helping mastermind jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell the IS war coffers.

Meanwhile, Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda online, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers to join fighting in the Middle East.
In June, MailOnline revealed an account on the ask.fm social media site, believed to be operated by al-Britani, which gave self-identified youths advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and perks of the job from working with IS.
It comes as British intelligence operatives continue to use advanced recognition software to match known suspects to 'John's' voice.
Security sources revealed to The Times that, thanks to information posted online, MI5 is now 'zeroing in' on the wanted man.
It was also revealed that police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons to help to establish the identity of the jihadist. Meanwhile, a small group of officers from the FBI is understood to be arriving to help British forces with their investigation.
Strict security protocols have also reportedly been put in place to stop classified information leaking to the wanted jihadists or their associates. 
In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said: 'Our intelligence agencies and police are studying the material that we have received.
'You wouldn't expect me to give a running commentary on that process, but we are devoting significant amounts of resource to identifying the individual.' 
He also ruled out an alliance with the Assad regime in Syria to combat the Islamic State (formerly Isis), saying that 'my enemy's enemy is not my friend'.
His statement comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new laws to tackle British extremists.
Theresa May said Britain must introduce all the legal powers necessary to win the struggle against terror that is feared to last for decades.
Banning orders for extremist groups will be looked at again alongside powers to stop radical preachers.

Mrs May also underlined changes to the law that mean naturalised Britons who are fighting overseas can be stripped of their citizenship and excluded.
Yesterday it emerged that the group holding Mr Foley has demanded the release of al-Qaeda scientist Aafia Siddiqui. 
The Pakistani mother-of-three, 42, is serving 86 years in a Texas jail for plotting to spread Ebola and make a dirty bomb.

It came as Mr Foley's brother Michael urged officials to reconsider their policy of not negotiating in order to save another US journalist, Steven Sotloff.
He said: 'I hope that Jim's death pushes us to take another look at our approach.'
General Martin Dempsey, Chariman of President Obama's Joint Chiefs of Staff, yesterday warned that IS had an 'apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision' and could only be defeated by a coalition of partners."
2529,"While Daleks ""know no fear"" and ""must not fear,"" the cold, calculating robots from the Dr. Who series don't exist in the real world yet and Microsoft has had to settle on the next best thing for securing its campuses: the K5.

Microsoft is the first company in Silicon Valley to dispatch a fleet of the K5 policing robots. Each 5-foot tall, 300-pound K5 is equipped with arrays of high-definition camera, sensors, debilitating sirens, Wi-Fi and artificial intelligence.

The squat policing robots are the product of Knightscope, a startup firm from Mountain View, Calif. William Santana Li, chairman and CEO of Knightscope, sees a world in which his company's policing robots move out of the private sector and start working alongside law enforcement officers.

""Technology and robotics are making the concept of Precision Policing -- a systematic, proactive and almost precognitive approach to ensuring public safety -- a real possibility,"" said Li in a March blog post.

The K5s can use their sensors to track down threats and their Wi-Fi connection to call in bipedal backup, aka security guards. Their AI and camera rigs enable the K5s to do a good deal of profiling, scanning license plates and faces to compare against databases available to them over Wi-Fi.

The K5 robots are only tools to surveil, assess and report suspicious activity, for now at least. There are plans in the works that could see the K5s brandishing and using Taser guns -- ""you are being neutralized.""

The K5s sensors enable them to recognize and analyze alphanumeric text, heat signatures, sounds, air quality and infrared light. The robots are equipped with both radar and Lidar to help them make measurements, while GPS helps them maintain their bearing and report their positions. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, is a remote-sensing technology used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser and then analyzing the reflected light.

The robots are fully autonomous and can even refuel at a charging station without the guidance of humans. The K5s leverage their machine learning abilities for predictive analytics, analyzing and accounting for risks in real time.

To keep people assured that the machines aren't abusing their abilities or beginning to learn too much, Knightscope plans to let people keep an eye on the machines by making the K5s' video feeds available to the public online.

""I believe robots are the perfect tools to handle the monotonous and sometimes dangerous work in order to free up humans to more judiciously address activities requiring higher-level thinking, hands-on encounters, or tactical planning,"" states Li."
2530,"More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign

A top military official in Nigeria was reported Friday to have announced a cease-fire between the government and the military group Boko Haram, igniting both skepticism and hopes that more than 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped in April would be released.

The truce was said to be announced by Air Marshall Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s chief of defense, the Associated Press reports. The release of the girls is still being negotiated, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade added, but the cease-fire would begin immediately and could take take several days to reach the groups of militants.

“Already, the terrorists have announced a cease-fire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,” said Mike Omeri, a government spokesman on Boko Haram, at a news conference. The AP adds that Omeri confirmed negotiations about the girls’ potential release were held throughout the week.

Reports of the deal were met with hesitation by those who have followed the saga since the girls were abducted from their school in Chibok on April 14. There was neither an official statement quickly released by the government, nor an announcement made by the insurgent group, the New York Times reports.

Boko Haram, which released a video in May that claimed responsibility for the girls’ abductions and vowed to “sell them on the market, by Allah,” has previously demanded the release of rebel prisoners in exchange for their freedom. But Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who has faced intense global pressure to free the students, said that’s a trade he will not make. The Nigerian government has in the past misled the public about the girls’ status; its fight against Boko Haram has been fraught with challenges since the militant group rose up in 2009, from inefficiency and corruption in the military to lax local support in the northern communities that are threatened most.

In August, the Wall Street Journal reported that American surveillance planes spotted groups that appeared to be the missing girls, suggesting that not all of them had been sold into marriage or slavery — as feared — and that some were perhaps being kept as a bargaining tactic."
2531,"A Guantanamo Bay prisoner released last year as part of an exchange for captured US serviceman Bowe Bergdahl has resumed contact with the Taliban, according to reports.

The former detainee - one of five men released in a controversial deal which saw the return of the US PoW from Afghanistan - is said to have been in touch with members of the al-Qaeda linked Haqqani network.

This is the first suggestion that any of the detainees involved in the swap may be trying to engage again in militant activity.

The five, who mostly held mid- to high-level positions within the Taliban before their capture during the early days of the US-led war in Afghanistan, were detained because of their association with the terror group.

Since their release they have been living in Qatar, which promised to monitor the men on behalf of the US.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

US Sen Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country, but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the US-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Mr Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Mr Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Mr Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to US troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organisation in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy."
