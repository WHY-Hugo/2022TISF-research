Flight 567 to Portland, Ore., was taxiing to the runway for a 7:50 p.m. departure when the passenger was stung, said Cole Cosgrove, a spokesman for Alaska Airlines.

The plane returned to the gate and medics checked the woman. She declined additional medical treatment but did not stay on the flight, Cosgrove said.

The woman had brushed the scorpion off of her before  stepping on it. Employees searched the plane and checked the overhead bins but did not find other scorpions, Cosgrove said.

Among the 139 passengers were players and coaches for the Oregon State University men’s basketball team, who tweeted about the scorpion. Coach Wayne Tinkle told ESPN that he sat two rows behind the passenger who was stung.

""The woman was a real champ,” Tinkle said. “She acted like it was a mosquito bite. They got it off her but the needle was stuck.

The airline doesn’t know where the scorpion came from, but Cosgrove noted that the flight originated in Los Cabos, Mexico.

After a 50-minute delay the plane took off at 8:40 p.m. and arrived in Portland without further incident, Cosgrove said."

Joan Rivers' personal doctor reportedly took a selfie with the US comedian while she was under general anaesthetic.

The claim was made by a staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic where Rivers underwent a scheduled endoscopy late last month, according to CNN.

The 81-year-old went into cardiac arrest on the operating table and died a week later at Mount Sinai Hospital.

The endoscopy procedure was conducted by gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, but CNN cited their source as saying a second doctor entered the room afterwards and performed an unplanned and unauthorised biopsy on Rivers' vocal chords.

That doctor, described only as the comic's personal ear, nose and throat physician, was reportedly not certified by the clinic as required by law.

According to the CNN report, the same source told a state health department investigation into Rivers' death that the doctor first took a selfie with the unconscious star.

They also said the investigators believe Rivers could have suffered the cardiac arrest after the biopsy caused her throat to swell and cut off the flow of oxygen to her lungs.

The clinic declined to respond to the comments about a selfie, but last week issued a statement saying ""a biopsy of the vocal cords"" has ever been performed on site.

Patient confidentiality laws prohibited them from specifically referencing Rivers' case.

A couple of days later a spokesperson for the clinic said Dr Cohen was no longer the facility's medical director and was not performing procedures there.

2023,"Debate is raging online as to whether pic shows super-sized snapper of the Kent coast could be the biggest ever to grace UK shores

Is this Britain's biggest crab caught on camera?

The shock snap clicked from the air has caused a stir online, with many convinced it shows a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

But others claim the photo is fishy - and is nothing more than a oddly-shaped sandbank or a a bit of image manipulation.

The 'super crab' picture shows the harbour at Whitstable, Kent. And the unexplained 'creature of the deep' dwarfs fishing boats left on the nearby pier

The pic appeared on the website Weird Whitstable - a collection of the strange put together by Quinton Winter.

Weird Whitstable   Claws for concern: Is this picture shared on the internet the biggest crab the banks of Britain have ever seen?

He told the Daily Express that he saw the mega-crab last summer.

Quinton said: ""At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, 'that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood'.

""It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

""Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.""

The world's largest recorded crab is the Japanese spider crab, a species which can grow to around 12ft and weigh up to three stone.

2026,"After the news that a Floridian woman had an operation to add a third boob to her chest, we decided to look at the world's weirdest breasts

Jasmine Tridevil, a Floridian massage therapist, has had an operation to give herself a third breast, in what is perhaps the most controversial boob job of 2014.

We decided to look at the three most statistically unlikely pairs of breasts in the world.

1. Jasmine Tridevil- Three breasts

Jasmine had to call 50-60 doctors in order to get her controversial operation. She said: “It was really hard finding someone that would do it, too, because they’re breaking the code of ethics”.

She did it because she wanted a reality TV show on MTV, but she had another reason, too.

“I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don’t want to date anymore.”

Average: Most women have two breasts

2. One of the most extreme boob jobs

Model Sarah Marie Summer - who's addicted to boob jobs The 23-year-old glamour model who has had three surgeries to go up a whopping 18 bra sizes wants to go even bigger

We didn't know this was possible.

Sarah Marie Summer, from Sydney, who is 'addicted to boob jobs' went up 18 cup sizes and has had four boob jobs.

Her boob jobs, which have got her to an M cup, have won her fans and modelling work.

This is one of the most extreme possible boob jobs.

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

3. World's largest natural boobs- 48V

Annie Hawkins-Turner won the Guinness World Record for the biggest natural breasts. Her boobs started developing at the age of nine. She said: ""I just started growing, and kept right on. I started wearing a bra when I was in third grade, and it was a regular grown-up woman's bra. I don't remember ever wearing a training bra.""

Average: The average UK bra size is a 34 DD.

2038,"The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a ""black hole"" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation."
2040,"THE scourge of ISIS — a female Kurdish warrior who was credited with killing 100 jihadists — may have herself died in the desperate battle to prevent the city of Kobani falling into extremist hands. But her sisters-in-arms fight on.

The young woman, known only by the pseudonym ‘Rehana’, became world famous after a picture of her flashing a “V” for victory sign went viral on social media.

She was part of an unusual movement in the Islamic world: A 10,000 strong, fully female and officially sanctioned militia unit dedicated to defending Kurdish territory.

Most female Peshmerga fighters are trained as snipers.

HOLY EUNUCHS: Do Islamic State jihadists face the ‘big snip?’

The unit was formed in April to combat the Islamic State’s extreme version of Islam which would have women locked up in their houses, only able to leave in the presence of their husbands.

It’s an idea foreign to the Kurdish culture.

“It’s not strange that women are fighting,” Wahida Kushta, an elderly Kobani woman told news organisation AP after preparing the body of a young female fighter for burial. “There is no difference between a lion and a lioness.”

Rehana’s exploits were eagerly followed by pro-Kurdish media, culminating in the boast that she had killed more than 100 Islamic State fighters in the desperate defence of the besieged city.

It was a boast which struck a raw nerve with Islamic State propagandists.

But Rehana is not alone. Reports suggest as many as one-in-three of Kobani’s defenders is a woman.

It’s a struggle that has come at a heavy price.

Recently, ISIS social media propagandists have circulated a gruesome picture purporting to show Rehana’s severed head — complete with long blonde hair — being held aloft in a victory salute by a bearded jihadist.

Pictures and video also have emerged of Kurdish defenders burying female fighters in Kobani. There was no indication Rehana was one of them.

There is no doubt the toll among the female defenders has been high.

The bloody 40-day battle for the city of Kobani has reportedly claimed more than 815 lives. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights today said the death toll includes 21 Kurdish civilians and 302 fighters with the main Kurdish force known as the Peoples Protection Units, or YPG. It said 481 fighters with the Islamic State group have been killed since the battles began.

US aircraft have recently been attempting to assist the resistance fighters, circling above the city in the chance of spotting Islamic State movements.

More than half the city is in jihadist hands, despite recent setbacks.

IS commanders have reportedly pulled troops back from Iraq as a result of the unexpectedly spirited opposition. The jihadists are being assembling them in their Syrian capital Aleppo under the leadership of red-headed Chechen commander Abu Omar al-Shishani. He is expected to lead them in an effort to relieve jihadists fighting in and around Kobane

Al-Shishani had been in command of fighters surrounding the mountains where ethnic Yezidi civilians had fled, sparking an international crisis and relief air-drop campaign.

If Kobani was to collapse under the Islamic State onslaught, the jihadists would gain control of a significant swathe of northern Syria.

ISLAM’S FEMALE FIGHTERS

“I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,” Afshin Kobani, a 28-year-old teacher now fighting on the front lines in Kobani, told AP at the weekend. “This is our land — our own — and if we don’t do it, who else will?”

She is now part of the Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which has an Independent Women’s Battalion (Yekineyen Parastina Jin), or Women Protection Units (YPJ)

Kurdish media states this group of “fearless and effective” women live and fight alongside their male counterparts.

“We are just the same as men; there’s no difference,” Afshin said. “We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.”

The unit gained international attention earlier this month when one of its 20-year-old fighters blew herself up as her position on the outskirts of Kobane was overrun, taking up to 20 Islamic State fighters with her.

The battalion, sometimes called “Peshmergettes”, has a fully female chain of command. The detachment of the battalion fighting for the city of Kobane operates under its own female commander, Mayssa Abdo.

“We can say that the Kobani resistance is in particular a women’s resistance,” Abdo recently told Kurdish media group, The Rojava Report. “In order to enter Kobani the ISIS gangs will have to pass over our corpses,”

Fighters in the volunteer force usually do not go under their own names, but instead use pseudonyms.

JIHADISTS FEAR DEATH BY WOMEN?

US Congressman Ed Royce told the US House International Relations Committee that Islamic State militants feared the “Peshmergettes” because they would strip them of their heavenly afterlife.

Fundamentalist jihadists fight believing their martyrdom on the battlefield will be rewarded with 72 virgins upon their arrival in heaven, he said. However, death at the hands of a woman is supposed to strip them of this God-given reward.

“And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance — slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away,” he told the New York Post.

It is a belief the Kurds have been exploiting in their own propaganda campaigns — even though its validity is hotly contested by extremist Islamic scholars.

“I think this has more to do with the fact that they have never come across women as determined and as courageous as us,” Kurdish fighter Bejan Ciyayi recently told the International Business Times."

2050,"Iraq's army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.

""The Iraqi Parliament's National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,"" Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

""We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL's control in Al-Baqdadi region,"" the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition's planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition's military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),"" he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

""The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, ""These documents are given to the investigation committee ... and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.""

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL's survival in Iraq.

""The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,"" Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition's support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, ""The coalition has not targeted ISIL's main positions in Iraq.""

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are ""not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month"".

Gharawi added that ""the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.""

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that ""unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city"".

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

""The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,"" Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

""The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,"" she added.

Hababi said that the coalition's precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group - while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition's and the US' claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.

The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL's deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue."
2057,"Jihadi John, the Briton who beheaded two British and two American hostages held by Islamic State terrorists, has been injured in a US-led air strike, according to reports received by the Foreign Office.

The masked ‘executioner’ with a London accent is believed to have narrowly escaped death when he attended a summit of the group’s leaders in an Iraqi town close to the Syrian border last Saturday.

The meeting was targeted by American and Iraqi jets.

The US Air Force attacked a bunker where Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and Jihadi John were meeting in Iraq

‘We are aware of reports that this individual [Jihadi John] has been injured, and we are looking into them,’ a Foreign Office spokesman told The Mail on Sunday.

This newspaper has received an independent account of how Jihadi John was injured and rushed to hospital after a devastating air strike in Al Qaim, in Anbar Province, Western Iraq.

The Foreign Office spokesman added: ‘We have a number of sources of information coming in.

‘The incident occurred last weekend, and so we have received the reports in the last few days. We don’t have any representation inside Syria, and so it is difficult to confirm these reports.’

The Foreign Office also issued an official statement saying: ‘We are aware of reports. We cannot confirm these reports.’ A spokesman for US Central Command said they were unable to confirm the details for security reasons.

The joint US-Iraqi mission left at least ten IS commanders dead, and around 40 injured.

Those reportedly hurt included IS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

But until now, Jihadi John’s presence at the meeting has not emerged.

It is also not known whether Jihadi John was intentionally targeted or merely happened to be present.

The secret, heavily guarded meeting took place last Saturday in a makeshift underground bunker beneath a house in Al Qaim. At least 30 tribal elders from various parts of Syria and Iraq gathered to pledge allegiance to Al-Baghdadi, according to our well-placed Syrian source. He said Jihadi John, as a senior IS figure in his own right, who goes by the nomme de guerre Jalman Al-Britani, was also present.

Sources claim that Jihadi John, pictured, was injured and rushed to hospital following the surgical airstrike in Iraq which killed ten ISIS commanders, the killer, who has a London accent, murdered Steven Sotloff

Jihadi John was also responsible for the murder of British aid worker Alan Henning, left

According to our source, a nurse who treated the wounded in a hospital in Deir-ez-Zour, confirmed that one of the names on the injured list was Jalman, saying it was ‘the one who slaughtered the journalists’.

It is not clear how seriously the British fanatic was hurt, but the source said that both he and Al-Baghdadi were rushed to the Al Qaim General Hospital for treatment.

IS members issued urgent calls through the local mosque’s loudspeakers, appealing for the town’s residents to donate blood at the hospital.

Our source, who does not want to be identified for his own safety, added that Jihadi John, Al-Baghdadi and the other wounded IS personnel were then driven to Syria, and travelling 200 miles north along the Euphrates valley to the IS stronghold of Raqqa.

The injured were taken to two captured Syrian army barracks near the city in the hope that underground medical facilities there would provide protection against further air strikes.

The source said that hospitals in Raqqa and nearby Deir-ez-Zour were ordered to take their medical supplies and staff to the secure bases, once the HQs of the Assad regime’s 17th Division and 93rd Brigade.

Jihadi John, right, became one of the world's most wanted terrorists after he murdered James Foley, left

Jihadi John, who also murdered David Haines, left, is believed to live in the Syrian town of Al Bukamal

Jihadi John has become one of the world’s most hunted terrorists after beheading British aid workers David Haines, 44, from Perth, and Alan Henning, 47, from Manchester; and American journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31. Footage of the atrocities has been released online, and in the most recent gruesome execution video of Mr Henning, put out last month, the murderer threatened to behead another US hostage, Peter Kassig, 26, an aid worker.

British journalist John Cantlie, also held hostage, has been forced to appear in a series of internet propaganda videos for IS.

Our source, who has contacts with the IS leadership in Syria, also throws fresh light on the role played by Jihadi John within the terrorist group.

Unlike most other western Muslim recruits, he has risen to a position of some seniority. Normally, Western fighters occupy lowly positions, mainly being used as foot soldiers or performing guard duty. Although believed to formerly have been a prison guard for IS, Jihadi John was made a member of a shura council, or governing body, of an IS ‘wilayat’, or province.

IS is now controlling large areas of Syria and Iraq, which it has declared an Islamic caliphate. Jihadi John is understood to be in the shura council for the wilayat of Al Furat, an area that straddles the Syria-Iraq border and includes Al Qaim, the scene of the air strike.

Our source added that Jihadi John does not live in Raqqa, but in Al Bukamal, a small desert town which borders Iraq.

He is aged between 28 and 31, and is fluent in English, Arabic and classical Arabic, the language of the Koran, according to our source. He first joined IS in Iraq when he left the UK, but then moved to Syria.

The source said that Jihadi John usually travels in a black Audi jeep, and he has six other British terrorists with him who act as his bodyguards.

In the confusion following the bombing last weekend, rumours swiftly spread that IS leader Al-Baghdadi had been killed.

Last week, in order to scotch those rumours, he issued a 17-minute audio recording, exhorting extremists to ‘erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere’.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained an Iraqi intelligence document from the Federal Intelligence and Investigation unit of the Ministry of Interior, which outlines last Saturday’s attack.

The document said that Al-Baghdadi was wearing black and first went to a kindergarten building before going to have lunch at an IS leader’s house. It is believed that the air strikes took place when he was meeting the other leaders in a bunker beneath that property.

It is understood that Jihadi John has been moved to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria, pictured

Muhammad Nasser Delli, an MP for Anbar province, told The Mail on Sunday that local residents confirmed to him that they saw Al-Baghdadi being treated at Al Qaim.

He said: ‘A number of people saw him there, but he did not stay at the hospital long. There were lots of women and children that were killed on Saturday during the air strikes.’

The Iraqi intelligence paper also states that Al-Baghdadi was taken to Al Qaim hospital, before being driven to Syria.

It lists 16 IS leaders as having been killed in the attack, and nine injured.

Among the dead are Abu Huzaifa Al-Adnany, a security guard to Al-Baghdadi, and Abu Quatayba, the cleric of Al Furat wilaya, who would sit in the same shura council as Jihadi John.

Also dead is a prominent IS fighter from Chechnya called Abu Abdul Rahman Al-Shishani, says the document."
2059,"Brain surgery recovery can be a gamble, but not everybody wakes up in the middle of the procedure. Surgeons don’t yet know exactly how the organ works, so it’s always a risk.

Iga Jasica, a 19-year-old Polish girl, woke up while it was happening and gave the surgeons a surprise. The reason for the surgery was to remove a tumor which had apparently been bothering her for a while. It is suspected that the surgeons may have triggered neurons which caused her to regain consciousness and the ability to hear and speak, but not the senses of sight and feeling.

It was also possible that the doctors had given her the anesthetics incorrectly. Fox News claims that investigators are looking into the reason why Jasica spent part of her brain surgery awake. The surgeons may have simply activated the right neurons despite successful administration of anesthesia.

The surprisingly premature brain surgery recovery is a rare situation, and the surgeons said the first thing she did was ask them, “How’s it going?”

Iga Jasica allegedly didn’t appear to wake up in pain, and didn’t sound panicked or frightened. Officials have stated that even though her brain was fully exposed, there was no danger, and her health was not in jeopardy.

The patient reportedly felt so comfortable that as she chatted with the surgeons, Jasica started talking about cats.

After her successful brain surgery recovery, Jasica told the Daily Mail about the experience.

“I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love.

“I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.”

Spending part of brain surgery awake can be a scary situation, but this time everything turned out fine. It even led to an amusing tale of a 19-year-old girl who got rid of a brain tumor and loves cats.

2063,"An Islamic State video has appeared which purports to show the beheading of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist being held hostage by the militants.

Mr Sotloff disappeared in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month showing fellow US journalist James Foley being killed.

After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports.

The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the apparent beheading is a way for IS to get back at the US for its actions.

Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video.

""I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports,"" he said.

""If there is a video that's been released, it's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity."""
2065,"The son of an aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s uncle is in hiding in France after evading abduction by agents of the Communist regime, foreign diplomatic sources believe.

“There was an attempt to force him to go back, but it is thought he escaped and is somewhere in France. There is an attempt to locate him but he hasn’t been found yet,” said the diplomatic source.

The architecture student, referred to only by his surname Han, went missing last month, raising concerns for his safety. He is believed to be the son of a close confidant of Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un’s once powerful uncle who was executed in December last year on treason charges. Han's father is known to have been killed recently as part of a Kim regime purge of Jang allies.

Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea’s biggest news agency which broke the story, said: “Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home.

“If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.”

Han’s curious disappearance, which comes amid heightened tensions between North Korea and America over the Sony Entertainment Pictures hacking scandal, has lifted the lid on the murky ties France keeps with the Communist regime.

Despite having no official diplomatic relations with the dictatorship, France has been behind a discreet student programme in place since 2002 in which North Korean students from privileged backgrounds study architecture in Paris. The stated aim is for them to return to Pyongyang and launch grandiose architectural projects to the glory of the dictatorship.

Han was studying at Paris’ prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette. He had left North Korea for Paris in 2012, along with nine other North Koreans, five of whom are posted at another architecture school in Belleville. They are in their third year of a five-year course.

“We didn’t decide out of the blue to take on students from North Korea, the decision was made by the French culture ministry to whom we answer. This is over our heads,” said a head teacher at the La Villette school, who recalled her surprise when the first batch of students turned up wearing badges with the effigy of their “Dear Leader”.

The students are kept under close surveillance, she told The Telegraph.

“There is often an Asian man in a three-piece suit waiting in the courtyard, checking up on attendance and if they get good results,” she said.

“When one failed part of his exam and was sent home, a representative from the North Korean delegation in Paris wanted to take it in his place. We had to explain that wasn’t possible,” she added.

After long denying its existence, the French foreign ministry confirmed to The Telegraph that a “cooperation programme” involving “students from North Korea trained in architecture in Paris” has been in place for the past decade.

It had no further comment.

The programme was set up by Jean-Noël Juttet, a former French ambassador to Japan, who said he was asked by the French foreign ministry to find ways of “maintaining contact between the two countries”.

Homing in on education, he said the French suggested courses in “priority sectors, like medicine, food or construction” but that the North Koreans were only interested in one field: architecture.

“That was a request that came all the way from the top. They insisted so much that we ended up agreeing,” he told Street Press, an online news site that first uncovered the student programme.

Trained in France, the land of star architects like Jean Nouvel, the students are supposed to help transform Pyongyang’s skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 330-metre high edifice completed in 2012. They have reportedly been behind designs for a new ice skating rink, dolphinarium and sports centre opened last year to help North Korea become a “new society of leisure”.

Architecture is not Kim Jong-un’s only area of interest in France. In April, it also emerged that the Emmental-loving despot had ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese-making at a dairy school in eastern France - reportedly because he was dissatisfied with his country’s attempts at dairy production. The school politely declined.

France has historically kept relatively warm ties with Communist nations, including China. In 2011, it emerged that a French neurosurgeon, Francois-Xavier Roux, had secretly treated Kim Jong-il, the former North Korean leader, in 2008 after he had a stroke.

Describing Kim as apparently ""profoundly Francophile”, Dr Roux said: ""He wanted to establish political ties with France. He was not hiding that.

""He also knew French cinema very well. I was pretty surprised. He knew French wines pretty well. We were talking about the differences between Bourgogne and Bordeaux, etc.""

Last month, it was reported that Pyongyang flew in a French surgeon to operate on Kim Jong-un’s feet after state media pictured him walking with a cane.

Behind the university exchange lies a complex game of parallel diplomacy, according to North Korea expert Pierre Rigoulot.

“For North Korea, the exchanges are a way of legitimising the Pyongyang regime and receiving recognition. The aim for which they will sacrifice anything is to open an embassy in Paris. It would be a small victory for the country,” he told Street Press.

As for France, he said it was a way of keeping channels of communication open: “You can’t send information to North Korea, so welcoming these young students is a rare opportunity to communicate with the country. In the long term, it could be a way of moving things forward.”

An abduction attempt, however, if confirmed, would “definitively scupper any North Korean request for diplomatic recognition from France,"" he said."
2066,"A French police officer who was in charge of investigating last week’s attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo that left 12 people dead took his own life after the massacre, French television channel France 3 reported.

Helric Fredou reportedly shot himself on Wednesday in his police office in the west-central city of Limoges with his service weapon.

The 45-year-old commissioner was found dead by one of his colleagues shortly after he had met with the family of a victim of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

He reportedly killed himself while preparing the report.

According to France 3, the senior police officer suffered from “depression” and “burn out.”

In 2013, Fredou discovered the body of one of his colleagues who had also committed suicide.

Last week, France was in shock following the killing of 12 people in an attack on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, avowedly in retaliation for the magazine’s defiant stance in publishing cartoons they deemed offensive to Islam.

2071,"A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has made what would be his first public appearance at a mosque in the center of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video. There had previously been reports on social media that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would make his first public appearance since his Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant changed its name to the Islamic State and declared him caliph. The Iraqi government denied that the video, which carried Friday's date, was credible. It was also not possible to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording or the date when it was made.

Iraqi officials said Sunday that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS or Islamic State terror group, was wounded in a U.S.-led airstrike on a convoy of militants in Iraq, and a security strategist said the attack killed his close aide.

While Pentagon officials said they cannot confirm whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy that was targeted, Iraq's Defense and Interior Ministries issued statements saying the ISIS leader had been wounded, according to The Associated Press.

An Iraqi Interior Ministry intelligence official also cited informants within the terror group as saying that the ISIS leader was hit in the town of Qaim in Iraq's western Anbar province.

Auf Abdulrahman Elefery, a ""very close companion"" of al-Baghdadi and also known as Abu Suja, was killed along with several other members of the ISIS when planes struck the group's convoy on Friday night, Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi security strategist, told The Telegraph.

""He and Baghdadi were rarely separate. It's for this reason that it could be possible that Baghdadi was with him [at the time of the attack],"" al-Hashimi was quoted as saying. ""There are more 20 other people were killed in the US air strike but they are not senior in the organization.""

Baghdadi was supposedly an Islamic preacher at the time of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He later became a militant and was briefly detained by American forces at Camp Bucca, according to Defense Department officials.

Baghdadi, who is in his early 40s and has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, then allegedly met and received training from al-Qaeda operatives, and later became the leader of the ISIS.

The U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes on ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria since August.

On Friday, U.S.-led airstrikes destroyed a convoy of 10 armed trucks in the attacks on a gathering of ISIS leaders near Mosul.

A Mosul morgue official said about 50 bodies of ISIS militants were brought to the facility after the airstrikes.

The U.S. has now also doubled the number of its troops in Iraq to fight ISIS militants.

While there are about 1,400 U.S. troops in Iraq, President Obama Friday authorized Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to send 1,500 more troops to train and assist Iraqi forces in fighting ISIS militants, as was requested by Iraq's government.

ISIS, an al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, now controls large parts of territories in Iraq and Syria, and seeks to form an Islamic emirate in the Levant region through ""jihad.""

ISIS is seen as the most brutal jihadist terror group. According to reports, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, who have been beheaded by ISIS militants, were subjected to severe physical torture, including waterboarding, and a majority of them converted to Islam under duress."

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” he said.

The man, who sustained cuts and bruises on his face and chest and was taken to the hospital after other fisherman found him, said he firmly believes if his phone hadn’t rang he would have been killed, marking the first time in written history that someone has been thankful for Justin Bieber’s existence.

2074,"This letter from a little girl in support of her gay teacher might bring a tear to your eye

A 9-year-old girl gave this heartfelt letter to her teacher after he came out as gay http://t.co/8ZErlBCfuS pic.twitter.com/JFfIRBnX4P— PinkNews (@pinknews) December 15, 2014

This letter of support was given to a primary school teacher by a 9-year-old girl after he came out as gay to his class.

The teacher, known as 'Mr R' decided to come out to his class after learning that the pupils felt there was something wrong or bad about gay and lesbian people.

The full letter reads:

“Dear Mr R

“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s (sic) that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do.

“From A x x

PS. We are all proud of you”

The teacher and school have not been revealed but the teacher gave an interview to Pink News.

He told the website he decided to come out to his class after he learned a worrying fact during anti bullying week:

“As part of anti-bullying week, I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.

He said he felt very moved by the letter and that it bought a tear to his eye.

“Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.

“For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow up, just acceptance.

“Now, I can mention my fiancé as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I’ve had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I’ll keep forever.”"
2082,"Convicted murderer Charles Manson's bride-to-be was reportedly using him for his body.
The 80-year-old convicted murderer and 27-year-old Afton Elizabeth Burton (a.k.a Star) received a marriage license in November and had 90 days to wed. The ceremony was postponed when Manson became ill and had to go to a medical facility.
Now, journalist Daniel Simone, the author of a new book about the killer, told the New York Post that Manson's fiance had a plan to put Manson's corpse on display.
PHOTO GALLERY | 1 of 38 IMAGES
⟨⟩
Along with friend Craig Hammond, Burton reportedly wanted to display Manson's body in a glass crypt, much like Lenin's tomb in Russia. The goal was apparently for the attraction to rake in a ton of money.
That creepy plan aside, Simone says that Manson, 80, never actually wanted to marry her anyway.
FOX 2 News reports that: ""Simone says Burton and Hammond initially wanted Manson to sign papers granting them ownership of his body, but the killer balked at the notion, so the two conceived the idea for Burton to marry Manson. The law in California, where Manson is incarcerated, grants spousal ownership of remains.""
""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool ... Manson never consented to the wedding in the first place and never will,"" Simone told The New York Post. ""He feels he will never die,"" Simone said. ""Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with,"" the Post reported.
Burton has not yet commented on her foiled plan. Burton's mother, Melissa Burton, told FOX 2 News that the Post article is not true. ""She is my daughter no matter what is going on in her life. You would love her unconditionally too if she were your child.""
Manson and Burton's wedding was in trouble ever since it was reported last week that their marriage license was set to expire.

On Monday the 2nd, The Associated Press reported that, ""Afton Elaine Burton and the 80-year-old Manson obtained a 90-day marriage license late last year. It expires Thursday, making this past weekend the couple's final opportunity to hold a wedding inside a visiting room at California State Prison, Corcoran. If the wedding is to happen, the couple must register for a new Kings County marriage license."""

Got something in your eye? Here’s the backstory:

The teacher told Pink News he had always felt worried about mentioning his sexuality at the school but was prompted to share it during an anti-bullying week initiative.

He said: “I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

He says he discussed the matter with the school’s headteacher and they agreed he could tell the class he was gay “so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they’re talking about me.”

The letter came some days later, he explained: “Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys had said during the lesson, ‘It’s just your life’. Then she went back to her maths.”"
2085,"Item: Vancouver Province columnist Tony Gallagher wrote Tuesday that the NHL will expand soon, and that a franchise in Las Vegas is a lock.

Well, we all know about Las Vegas and locks.

Hey, a team in Vegas would be nice because, well, the Seattle Metropolitans are getting ready for their first season in the Western Conference, and Vegas would make 16 teams in the West to balance out the 16 in the East and ...

Oh, wait, you say there's no team in Seattle? But, but, but ... we thought it was getting a franchise this year, too.

Yeah, the crickets are still competing with all the chirping about that, about how the NHL is increasing from 30 ... to 32 ... to 34 ... or more clubs.

Gallagher wrote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has changed his mind about expansion and is now ready to take the plunge — and that he doesn't have to stop at just two teams.

The NHL adding more than two fits historically. This is how the league has operated the past 40-plus years:

1967: Next Six, to join with the Original Six.

1970-74: Six, to continue Western expansion and to compete with the WHA.

1979: Four, as the league absorbed the surviving teams of the dying WHA.

1991-93: Five, as the Sun Belt strategy took hold.

1998-2000: Four, as part of the league's reunion tour (Atlanta, Minnesota, Ohio).

There are enough worthwhile markets outside Seattle and Las Vegas (Quebec City, Kansas City, Toronto, Hamilton, Portland) to go to 36. Also, Bettman and the owners know they can tap an easy revenue stream (aka franchise fees) if they want/need to pad their cash reserves."

Two Afghan policemen recently went missing while in Washington, D.C. for a DEA training program; they were found safe somewhere outside D.C."
2089,"Was Joan Rivers’ death preventable? New information suggests that Rivers should not have gone into cardiac arrest on that fateful August day. According to Radar Online, Joan’s daughter Melissa is ready to take legal action against the clinic that performed a “routine endoscopy” that went terribly wrong.

“It’s become very clear to Melissa and experts she has spoken to that her mother didn’t have to die. This was a routine endoscopy that went wrong. Melissa has also been told that staff members at Yorkville Endcoscopy revealed a shocking detail to medical investigators looking into Joan’s death — something occurred during the procedure that wasn’t medically related.”

Joan Rivers’ death was unexpected, and learning that she didn’t have to die is perhaps the hardest part. Many people suspect that something out of the ordinary happened when Joan was put under for her procedure, especially since her doctor (Dr. Cohen) parted ways with Yorkville Endoscopy right after the incident with Rivers occurred. Sources say that Melissa Rivers wants to wait until she learns her mother’s cause of death before she takes legal action.

“It was something related to Joan’s personal ear, nose and throat doctor and it wasn’t about the unplanned biopsy she did. Melissa will await the outcome of the official medical investigation and then absolutely file the lawsuits.”

According to CNN, staffers at the clinic revealed that Dr. Cohen took a selfie with Joan Rivers while she was under anesthesia. Also, Dr. Cohen reportedly took a biopsy of something that he found during the endoscopy without Rivers’ consent. It very well may have been the biopsy that caused Rivers to stop breathing.

“Investigators believe that Rivers’ vocal chords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said.”

As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Joan was rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a staff member called 911. Despite resuscitation efforts, Rivers was placed on life support when she was admitted to the hospital. There had been so many rumors about Joan “getting better” and “pulling through,” but once Melissa confirmed that her mom was on life support, the public sort of figured that things weren’t improving.

Rivers passed away on Sept. 4 (exactly one week after being admitted to the hospital) after being taken off life support.

2094,"An airstrike has wounded the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, according to Iraqi officials.

Pentagon officials said they had no immediate information on such a strike or of al-Baghdadi being wounded.

Iraq’s Defence and Interior Ministries issued statements saying al-Baghdadi had been wounded, without giving further detail.

An Interior Ministry intelligence official said al-Baghdadi was hit during a meeting yesterday with militants in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s western Anbar province.

The official, citing informants within the militant group, said the strikes wounded al-Baghdadi. A senior Iraqi military official also said he learned in operational meetings that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Neither knew the extent of al-Baghdadi’s apparent injuries.State television later also reported that al-Baghdadi had been wounded.

Al-Baghdadi, an ambitious Iraqi militant believed to be in his early 40s, has a 10 million dollar US (£6.2m) bounty on his head.

Since taking the reins of the group in 2010, he has transformed it from a local branch of al Qaida into an independent transnational military force, positioning himself as perhaps the pre-eminent figure in the global jihadi community.

A US-led coalition has been launching airstrikes on Islamic State militants and facilities in Iraq and Syria for months as part of an effort to give Iraqi forces the time and space to mount a more effective offensive.

The Islamic State had gained ground across northern and western Iraq in a lightning advance in June and July, causing several of Iraq’s army and police divisions to fall into disarray.

On Friday, US President Barack Obama authorised the deployment of up to 1,500 more American troops to bolster Iraqi forces, including into Anbar province, where fighting with Islamic State militants has been fierce. The plan could boost the total number of American troops in Iraq to 3,100."

Maybe you shoved french fries in it like birthday candles. Or ate it crust first, as was the style at the time.

In any case, if you’re a child of the nineties, you remember it well: McDonald’s pizza.



And, like pogs and Beanie Babies, it too disappeared with the innocence of your childhood.

Except, in two magical locations in Ohio and West Virginia, where one hero owner has kept the McDonald’s pizza ovens burning all these years later.

So bust out a gel pen to jot down these directions, because I’m about to tell you where you can still buy McDonald’s pizza.


Neslted on the banks of the Ohio River, along the border with West Virginia sits the village of Pomeroy, population 1,852 in the 2010 census. And its McDonald’s, located along Main Street on the riverbank, still pumps out pizza — in five minutes or less, of course.



It’s just a seven-and-a-half hour drive from Toronto in zero traffic, according to Google Maps.

And, thanks to owner Greg Mills, there’s another McD’s where you can still get a slice, just over ninety kilometres away, across the state border. Spencer, West Virginia also boasts a McDonald’s that’s still lighting the pizza fires — or electrical coils, as the case may be.

According to employee Judy Norman, it’s the same pizza as they sold when she started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s. She said the location sold 13 pizzas yesterday, but there are “days when everyone wants pizza and there are days where just every so often you get a pizza [order].”

Mills, who it’s pretty safe to call an American hero for preserving this very unique pizza, couldn’t not be immediately reached for comment, but this post will be updated should he return our calls.



Whatever actually happened to McDonald’s pizza, you ask?

Well, for starters, it turned out adult palates didn’t quite take to it the same way kids did. When McDonald’s first launched its pizza in the Canadian market in the early ’90s, it was tapping into a growing appetite for pizza as burger sales dwindled. It even launched hockey-themed TV ads.



The market for the savoury pie topped $2 billion in the early 90s, according to a 2004 National Post article on the death of McDonald’s pizza. And the company poured $25 million into the ovens alone across Canada, to moderate success throughout the decade. Then the-drive through took over — remember waiting for your pizza to be delivered with a plastic number on top of your car? — and pizza slowed things down as its own sales were dragging.

So the ovens were scrapped and McDonald’s turned its sights on other gimmicky productions — like the Arch Deluxe, which I think we can blame for Jessica Biel becoming a thing."

According to Kuo, shipments in the range of 4 million to 5 million will be seen by most component suppliers in March. However, a few components may also see low production yields, which could affect the assembly and shipping.

Kuo also forecast that the much-rumored 12-inch MacBook Air with Retina display will also ship in the same quarter, which is in synergy with other rumors. A report earlier inJanuary suggested that Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier, was beefing up production of the notebook to meet the Q1 2015 release deadline. The ultra-thin MacBook Air is rumored to tout a fan-less design and pack in the latest low-power processor from Intel (Core M). It is also expected to boast a high resolution Retina display and may be the first to incorporate the USB Type C connector which is reversible. This may also be used for charging the device.

Per Kuo, MacBook Air sales will likely touch the 6 million units sales mark (for the first three months of 2015), which is an increase from the 5.9 million forecast in Q1 2014.

The analyst sees iPhone shipments touch 61.7 million unit sales in Q1 2015. Kuo also anticipates a drop in demand for the iPad as the latest iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets did not create much of a stir in the holiday season."
2100,"The man behind the world famous 50ft Crabzilla spotted lurking beneath the waters in Whitstable has described the furore caused by the colossal crustacean as “a bit of fun”.

Quinton Winter, of Station Road, told KentOnline he was stunned by the amount of coverage the sea monster has clawed after it appeared at his exhibition at the Horsebridge Centre.

Aerial images of the shadowy figure emerged on the artist’s bizarre blog Weird Whitstable – which documents supernatural sightings across the town.

Artist Quinton Winter
This week it was splashed on the Daily Star front page with the story also featuring in worldwide news outlets including Australia, Malaysia and France.

But despite its popularity with the global media, the tale left online readers feeling rather crabby with criticisms it was “juvenile”.

Quinton said: “When I saw the picture I thought I could use it in my exhibition.

“I thought it may have been a sand formation but it looked like a crab to me.

“I’m not trying to lie about anything, it’s just a bit of fun.”

KM Group graphic artist Ashley Austen took a sceptical view of the paranormal find.

Crabzilla was 'spotted' off the coast of WhitstableCrabzilla was spotted lurking beneath the water
He said: “The image of the giant crab can be quite easily recreated in Photoshop. All the artist had to do is find a suitable image of a crab, overlay it on to the satellite picture of the harbour and apply a few filters.”

But Mr Winter said he didn’t think the image would be taken too seriously.

He said: “Sometimes you put stuff out there and no one takes any notice and then sometimes unexpectedly it goes everywhere. It has been a strange reaction.

“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?” - Quinton Winter
“I don’t think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?”

According to Weird Whitstable, Crabzilla surfaced in July last year at a popular crabbing spot after it was spotted by two young boys.

The boys, which included Mr Winter’s son, were blissfully unaware as the crab slipped silently under the water sideways.

According to the Marine Biological Association, the largest species is the Japanese spider crab which can grow up to 3.7m across - the size of a small car.

Other strange sightings reported by Weird Whitstable include a haunted fence in Tankerton."
2101,"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hit Saturday during a meeting with militants, though not much is known

Iraqi authorities announced on Sunday that an air strike wounded Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS).

He was hit Saturday in the town of Qaim in Iraq’s Anbar province during a meeting with militant forces, anonymous Iraqi officials told the Associated Press.

The Defense and Interior Ministries of Iraq said in statements that al-Baghdadi was injured, but they did not elaborate on the injury or the air strike. The Pentagon offered no additional information.

Since al-Baghdadi, thought to be in his early 40s, took over the militants in 2010, he has grown it from a local al-Qaeda branch into a powerful, independent Islamist extremist group.

The U.S. and allied forces began launching air strikes against ISIS targets in September.

2105,"A TRANSGENDER teenager who killed herself after her Christian parents refused to accept her has left a heartbreaking suicide note.

Leelah Alcorn, 16, stepped in front of a tractor trailer on a rural highway a few kilometres from her family home in Kings Mill, Ohio.

Her mother posted a tribute to her child on Facebook using her birth name Joshua and not mentioning the suicide.

However, the teen had published a note hours before her death on her Tumblr account explaining in detail why she had chosen to end her life.

She says that she identified as a girl from the age of four and that when she discovered that she could be transgender at aged 14 she “cried of happiness”.

“After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was,” she wrote.

Heartbreakingly, her devout Christian mother, Carla Wood Alcorn, refused to accept her desire to identify as a girl.

She wrote: “I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.”

‘Gay conversion therapy killed my son’

Leelah went on: “If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids. Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.”

She was forced by her parents to see a Christian therapist who told her she was selfish and wrong and should seek God’s help. When she didn’t receive her parents’ consent to transition at aged 16 she cried herself to sleep.

She said she turned against her parents, coming out as gay at school but despite positive responses from her friends she continued to be viewed by her mum and dad as “an embarrassment” because she was not “their perfect little straight christian boy (sic)”.

Writing about her reasons for suicide she said: “I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy. Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out.”

She ended the note: “My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s f***ed up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.”

In a short Facebook tribute Carla Wood Alcorn ignored her child’s female persona, calling her Joshua and saying she had gone “home to heaven” after she was hit by a truck during “an early morning walk”.

2107,"Christina Fernández de Kirchner, the president of Argentina, got a new addition to her family last week when she adopted a 13-year-old Jewish boy named Yair Tawil as her godson, the Independent reports. Her motivations for doing so are based on a centuries-old legend that seventh sons will transform into werewolves.

In Argentina, the werewolf is referred to as el lobison; in Paraguay it goes by the name Luison, and in Brazil it's called the Lobisomem. The Independent elaborates on the South American legend:

The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy’s 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.

In Guaraní mythology, the lobison is the offspring of Tau, an evil spirit, and Kerana, a mortal woman. In the cultures that believe in the lobison, that creature acts as a sort of Grim Reaper, whose mere presence means that death will soon befall those it comes into contact with. As the Independent explains, by the 19th century, fear of this creature was so acute in Argentina that families sometimes murdered their seventh sons to prevent the legend from coming true. So in 1907, in an attempt to stop this practice, the Argentinean president began adopting seventh sons, which the president insisted would stop the curse. In 1973, the Independent adds, the presidential adoption tradition was also extended to seventh daughters.

In addition to being able to say he's the president's godson, Tawil will receive a gold medal and enjoy a full educational scholarship. In modern times, the curse, it seems, is more aptly described as a blessing."

“Sources familiar with the matter within Apple have exclusively told The Michael Report that Apple plans to unveil the long-awaited Retina MacBook Air at the same event. The Michael Report has independently verified this information to be highly credible.”

Obviously, we can’t verify the accuracy of the report. The Michael Report unearthed full details of the iPad Air 2 before the product’s announcement in October of last year, however, the publication also whiffed on some iPhone 6 launch details, including the name of the iPhone 6 Plus, and the Nexus 6.

We’re not really expecting any hardware other than the Apple Watch at next week’s event, but Cupertino could surprise us. The last time the MacBook Air line was upgraded was April 2014, which was just a small spec bump, so it’s due for an update.

Hardware leaks of the 12-inch MacBook Air have been scarce, although multiple reports have confirmed that Apple is working on the device. The new Retina MacBook Air will supposedly feature a fan-less design made possible by Intel’s next-gen Broadwell processors.

2117,"A five-year-old was billed for failing to attend a friend's birthday party - resulting in threats of legal action.

Alex Nash, from Cornwall, was invited to the party just before Christmas.

An invoice for £15.95 was sent by his schoolfriend's mother Julie Lawrence, who said Alex's non-attendance left her out of pocket and his parents had her details to tell her he was not going.

Alex's father Derek said he had been told he would be taken to the small claims court for refusing to pay.

Alex's parents, from Torpoint, had accepted an invitation to the party at a dry ski slope in Plymouth, Devon, just before Christmas.

However, they realised their son was double-booked and due to spend time with his grandparents, which he did.

Analysis: Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent

It is all but impossible that Ms Lawrence will be able to recover the £15.95 party ""no show fee"".

Any claim would be on the basis that a contract had been created, which included a term that a ""no show"" fee would be charged.

However, for there to be a contract, there needs to be an intention to create legal relations. A child's party invitation would not create legal relations with either the child ""guest"" or its parents.

If it is being argued that the contract is with the child, it is inconceivable that a five-year-old would be seen by a court as capable of creating legal relations and entering into a contract with a ""no show"" charge.

It's amusing to imagine what a children's party invitation seeking to create a contract might say: ""I, the 'first party', hereinafter referred to as the 'birthday boy', cordially invite you the 'second party', hereinafter referred to as 'my best friend', to the party of 'the first party'.

His parents said they had no contact information for Ms Lawrence at that time.

They found the invoice in a brown envelope in his schoolbag last week.

Mr Nash said: ""It was a proper invoice with full official details and even her bank details on it.

""I can understand that she's upset about losing money. The money isn't the issue, it's the way she went about trying to get the money from me.

""She didn't treat me like a human being, she treated me like a child and that I should do what she says.""

In a short statement, Ms Lawrence said: ""All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.""

Mr Nash said he had been told he was being taken to the small claims court because he was refusing to pay.

The party was held at the Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

In a statement, the centre said: ""We would like all our customers to know that this invoice has nothing to do with Plymouth Ski and Snowboard Centre.

""No invoices are ever sent out from the centre to private individuals. This is a disagreement between the two parents involved and the fact that the centre has been named on the invoice is fraudulent.

""When booking a party there is a small deposit to pay on booking, confirmation of numbers and final balance are due 48 hours before the party.

""On the extremely rare occasion that people don't attend parents are generally offered other activities in compensation.""

2119,"The comedienne's doctor reportedly took a selfie with the star before undertaking an unauthorized biopsy, it has been claimed

Joan Rivers' personal doctor took a selfie while the comedian was under anesthesia and the physician was set to perform an unauthorized biopsy, a report has claimed.

The incident allegedly occurred in Manhattan's Yorkville ­Endoscopy shortly before Joan, 81, underwent a procedure on her vocal chords that led to her suffering a cardiac arrest, CNN reports.

Investigators have been informed of the incident by a member of staff at the clinic, according to the broadcaster, which also claims that gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen finished his work on the star shortly before her unidentified personal physician performed the biopsy.

Rex Features   Dr Lawrence Cohen the Yorkville Endoscopy doctor has been fired since Joan Rivers death - he did not carry out reported biopsy

However, just before performing the procedure, it is claimed that the physician took out his camera to take a picture of himself alongside Joan, who was unconscious at the time.

During the subsequent biopsy, Joan suddenly went into cardiac arrest, with investigators believing that her vocal chords began to swell, thereby cutting off oxygen to her lungs.

Earlier this week, a voice recording emerged of Rivers complaining of trouble with her vocal chords.

She can be heard saying: ""I told [you] I didn't feel good. My voice has been bothering me. I don't know what it is . . . I feel like s***. I'm tired already.""

Getty   Joan passed away a week after rumoured biopsy

Later, she said: ""That's it - I don't feel good.""

The news comes following reports that the clinic's medical director Dr. Lawrence Cohen had stepped down.

ABC News tweeted the news writing: ""Medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy where #JoanRivers went into cardiac arrest is out.

""He is no longer performing procedures at the clinic.""

While US gossip website TMZ reports that sources at the clinic say Dr. Lawrence Cohen - who is a world renowned gastroenterologist and co-owner of the clinic - stepped down after the board asked him to do so, but they're not directly blaming him for Joan's death.

A rep from the clinic confirmed he had stepped down from his position as medical director.

The clinic previously denied reports claiming they administered a general anaesthetic and conducted a vocal cord biopsy on the late star.

""A biopsy of the vocal cords has never been performed at Yorkville Endoscopy,"" a spokesperson for the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic said in a statement.

""General anaesthesia has never been administered. The type of sedation used at Yorkville Endoscopy is monitored anesthesia care. Our anesthesiologists utilise light to moderate sedation.""

According to the unnamed source, the alleged procedure should not be performed outside of a hospital.

Both the State Health Department and the New York City Medical Examiner's Office are still investigating the cause of Joan's death, after failing to determine how she died in a preliminary autopsy.

Her funeral - which took place on Sunday at the Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan - featured performances from Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman and The New York City Gay Men's Chorus, and was attended by friends and colleagues including Kelly Osbourne, Whoopi Goldberg and Sarah Jessica Parker.

According to The Independent, Argentina's president, President Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a boy named Yair Tawil as her godson so that he would not turn into a werewolf. It's actually part of a longstanding tradition in the country that dates back to a folk story in the country:

According to Argentinian folklore, the seventh son born to a family turns into the feared ""el lobison"". The werewolf-like creature shows its true nature on the first Friday after boy's 13th birthday, the legend says, turning the boy into a demon at midnight during every full moon, doomed to hunt and kill before returning to human form.

As well as feeding on excrement, unbaptized babies, and the flesh of the recently dead, the lobison was said to be unnaturally strong and able to spread its curse with a bite.
Because some people actually believed this hundreds of years ago, they started killing babies. So, to stop that from happening, presidents starting adopting the seventh born boys of families. The practice was later extended to include girls, too. Now, seventh born children not only get the country's president as their new godparent, they also get a gold medal and a scholarship.

According to The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Tawil is also the first Jewish boy to participate in the adoption tradition:

Shlomo and Nehama Tawil, parents of seven boys, in 1993 wrote a letter to the president asking for the honor and were denied. But this year, Yair wrote a letter to the president citing the 2009 decree and asking for the designation of godson.

On Tuesday, he became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history. Fernandez received Yair, his parents and three of his brothers in her office, where they lit Hanukkah candles together.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvelous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther."""

The Islamic State is harvesting human organs to finance its blood-driven caliphate, according to Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations, urging its Security Council to investigate the issue.

Envoy Mohamed Alhakim called on the 15-member body to look at allegations of organ removal by the Islamic State (formerly ISIS) as bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys were discovered in shallow mass graves.

“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” the envoy, Mohamed Alhakim, said on Tuesday.


“It is clear they are missing certain parts,” the diplomat also noted, adding that a dozen doctors were executed in in northern Iraq, after allegedly refusing to harvest organs of the ISIS victims.

The Islamic State is guilty of “crimes of genocide” of ethnic groups, Alhakim said.

“These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values. They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people whether Shi'ite, Sunni, Christians, Turkmen, Shabak or Yazidis,” Iraq’s UN Ambassador said.


After the testimony, the UN envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, then briefed the Council saying that there are numerous reports to support the claim of organ harvesting, which the envoy says is done by the caliphate to finance its cause.

“It’s very clear that the tactics ISIS is using expand by the day,” Mladenov said.

“Almost daily terrorist attacks continue to deliberately target all Iraqis, most notably the Shi’ite community, as well as ethnic and religious minorities, across the country,” he told the Security Council, specifying that at least 790 people were killed in January in Iraq.

“Equally worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from (Islamic State) control,” he said.


Looking into the source of ISIS funding, Middle East media outlet, Al-Monitor, claimed that foreign doctors were harvesting organs in Mosul in a report last year based on a medical source.

According to the Iraqi doctor providing the information, otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli, there had been an “unusual movement” in clinics in Mosul, where Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but “prohibited from mixing with local doctors.”


The organs, al-Mosuli told Al-Monitor, were coming from kidnapped individuals, or wounded fighters.

“Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs,” the doctor claimed, accusing “specialized mafia” of being involved internationally.

Organ harvesting news comes as the Islamic State jihadists burnt 45 people alive near the town al-Baghdadi in Western Iraq. It also comes in the footsteps of the recent beheading of 21 Coptic Christians in Libya and the brutal execution of a Jordanian pilot."

2151,"The success of the Islamic State (IS) in sustaining its battles on more than one front in both Syria and Iraq, while fighting in several other countries, highlights that the group has multiple and significant sources of funding.

Summary⎙ Print The militant group relies on diverse forms of extortion to fund its operations in both Syria and Iraq.
Author Nassir al-HassounPosted December 5, 2014

Original Article اقرا المقال الأصلي باللغة العربية
According to data, there are two funding sources: internal and external. The latter includes a wide variety of funding schemes, including through medical facilities, oil and human trafficking mafias. According to sources in Mosul, the money supplied internally is allocated to local and foreign fighters, to encourage them to join up and continue fighting. IS took control of Mosul in June and then expanded in August to control large swaths of the country.

Residents of Mosul say that the sale of oil extracted from wells controlled by the organization in both Iraq and Syria has provided a sustained source of funding. The organization also opened trade canals through Kurdish [territories in] Iraq and Turkey, with the help of Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian traders.

In addition to oil sales, a secondary source of funding stems from the imposition of royalties on residents in IS territories. Members of the organization collect 50,000 dinars [$41.60] from each family as service and protection fees. The amount doubles for families whose sons did not join IS. One of the prominent tribal figures in Nineveh province, Sheikh Mohammad Abu Thayyab, said, “The IS gangs imposed 50,000 dinars worth of royalties on every family if one of their sons did not join these terrorists.”

Sources in the city say that oil prices have skyrocketed. The price of gas tanks used for cooking has reached 75,000 dinars, [about $62] while coal oil is sold at 5,000 dinars a liter [$4.16]. Meanwhile, the price of food has quadrupled.

The third funding source was exposed by otolaryngologist Siruwan al-Mosuli. He said that lately he noticed unusual movement within medical facilities in Mosul. Arab and foreign surgeons were hired, but prohibited from mixing with local doctors. Information then leaked about organ selling. Surgeries take place within a hospital and organs are quickly transported through networks specialized in trafficking human organs. Mosuli said that the organs come from fallen fighters who were quickly transported to the hospital, injured people who were abandoned or individuals who were kidnapped.

He said that organ sales yield large profits. A specialized mafia is engaged in these operations, in addition to medical institutions working in other countries. Without coordination among these parties, such a trade cannot be sustained, he said. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the organization sells bodies and organs of injured people they arrest.

The fourth source of funding is transforming the city of Nineveh, adjacent to Turkish borders, into a new center for drug trafficking. The Russian Federal Drug Control Service said IS was gaining significant revenues by smuggling and marketing Afghan heroin, which is sent from Iraq to Europe.

“The large-scale movement of Afghan heroin acts as an ongoing financial base, aiding the functioning of the Islamic State, which secures huge profits by providing half of the total heroin supplied to Europe via destabilized Iraq and some African countries,” the Russian body said in a statement.

For its part, the Times of London exposed a human trafficking network established by IS in Mosul, where women and children were sold for money. This also constitutes a funding source for the fighters. According to the newspaper, women and children of Yazidi, Christian and other minority backgrounds are also sold through a networking hub in Syria’s Raqqa.

A report by OHCHR confirmed that more than 25,000 women and children have been imprisoned, sexually violated and sold by IS.

The sixth funding source is human smuggling rings, especially for families who wish to emigrate to other countries. One family reached Turkey after reportedly paying $8,000 for each individual that escaped.

Livestock seized by IS during the occupation of Yazidi, Turkmen and Shiite villages has also been smuggled. According to Ali Abdel Razzak, the majority of the residents in these villages worked in large-scale livestock ranching. So far it has not been established how much IS members seized as spoils of war when the villagers fled.

When it comes to foreign funding, the organization has developed schemes that are difficult to uncover, despite intensive local and international monitoring. One such method, however, uses established trading routes. The organization has networks tasked with collecting donations from wealthy individuals under the pretext of supporting jihad. According to some sources in the trading industry, products are sold in the markets in IS at lower prices than within the countries of origin, a discrepancy that points toward money laundering."

After Feng Lung, 30, found out that Fan Lung, 32, was sending racy emails to another woman, she chopped it off, according to the Mirror.

Lung had used Feng's cell phone to send his lover an email, according to the news outlet.

After forgetting to log out of his account, she found the messages, and stormed into the bedroom where her husband was sleeping and allegedly cut off his penis with a pair of scissors.

But the anger for her husband and the father of her five children didn't stop there.

While he was recovering in the hospital, she allegedly snipped it off again after surgeons had reattached it.

She then threw it out the window.

Despite losing a lot of blood, Lung chased his wife outside.

""Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman,"" a hospital spokesperson said according to the news outlet.

Doctors and police officers failed to find his penis when they searched outside.

Feng Lung is now under arrest for grievous bodily harm, the new outlet reports.

But Fan Lung's lover isn't alarmed that Lung is missing his penis.

""It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility, he has five children already,"" she said."
2158,"The 45-year-old was investigating the devastating terrorist attack at Charlie Hebdo magazine when he killed himself

A senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre killed himself just hours after the horrific terror attack.

Commissioner Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, France 3 reported.

His body was found by a colleague at 1am on Thursday, hours after the terror attack at the satirical magazine's office which left 12 people dead.

It has been reported that shortly before committing suicide Commissioner Fredou had met with the family of one of the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack massacre.

Speaking to Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had committed suicide.

In a statement released after his death, a spokesman for the union said: ""It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.

""On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.

""The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.

""In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.""

Mr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.

He eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.

French media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.

The attack left 12 people dead. On Friday, the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family-run printing press in Dammartin-en-Goele .

In a separate incident on Friday, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket.

Four hostages were killed in the incident along with Coulibaly.

2160,"A pregnant woman lost her left eye when cops in Ferguson shot out a car window with a bean bag — sending shards of glass flying into her face, it was revealed on Friday.

Dornella Conner said she and her boyfriend, De’Angelas Lee, were “just riding around and respecting Mike Brown” when they stopped at a gas station in the the 10000 block of Halls Ferry early Tuesday, KMOV St. Louis reported.

Once at the gas station, Conner said, police confronted the couple.

“They pulled up while we were coming towards the street,” she told the local TV station. “De’Angelas was trying to get away, they blocked us from the side, front and back.”

But cops are crying foul — they say it was Conner and Lee who were the aggressors during the mayhem after Lee drove the car straight at them, according to KMOV.

That’s when one of the cops fired a specialized bean bag round into the front passenger window, in order to stop the car, police said.

Broken glass went flying into Conner’s face and eyes and she was rushed to a nearby hospital, but doctors were unable to save her left eye.

“Thanks [to] all my Facebook friends for your support,” she wrote Wednesday on Facebook. “Im blind in my left eye and they took it out because i got [shot] in my face … but thank god that i can see the world.”

Conner also remained optimistic for Thanksgiving, but made it clear that she feels the police should pay for what they did.

“Im soo thankful that im here too spend thanksgiving with my family and my kids even tho im still in pain,” she wrote Thursday. “I will have justices for what they did too me but I happy im alive.”

Conner’s father, Donnell, also called for something to be done for what happened to his daughter.

“I’m very upset, very disappointed with tactics that they used trying to get control of the situation,” he told KMOV. “I understand it’s a tough job, I understand that it was chaos, [but] there was no reason to fire upon an innocent person sitting in a vehicle.”"
2169,"Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire the maker of the game Minecraft for more than $2 billion, people briefed on the discussions said on Tuesday. The move was intended to ensure that one of the most popular games was available for the computing giant’s family of devices.

The sides still need to work out many details, and a deal could fall through, according to one of these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Acquiring Minecraft would give Microsoft control of an online world that has defied many of the conventions of the modern games business to become a blockbuster success.

Minecraft’s blocky graphics are crude by today’s standards, looking like virtual Lego bricks. But unlike many of the start-ups purchased by big technology companies for billions of dollars, Minecraft is already a lucrative business. This year, Mojang, the privately held Swedish company that makes Minecraft, told The Wall Street Journal that its revenue was about $360 million last year, up 38 percent from the year before. The Journal reported the discussions with Microsoft earlier on Tuesday. Mojang was co-founded by Markus Persson, a 35-year-old programmer and game designer who is better known in the gaming world by his gamer name, Notch. Mr. Persson has said in the past that he did not want to sell the company or take money from outside investors.
In an era when many games, especially for mobile devices, are given away, and derive their profit from the sale of virtual currency and other items, Mojang sells Minecraft the old-fashioned way — by charging people to buy a copy. The price varies depending on what kind of device people use to play the game, ranging from $7 on mobile phones to $27 for computer versions. A version of Minecraft for Microsoft’s Xbox, which has been a top seller for the console, costs $20.

For Microsoft, the interest in a deal is motivated in large part by a desire to ensure that attractive content is available for some of its most important platforms. Minecraft is not currently available on Windows Phone, the mobile operating system that Microsoft has struggled to turn into a strong competitor to Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android.

Minecraft has also not been adapted to take advantage of the graphical interface of Microsoft’s latest operating system for computers and tablets, Windows 8. The game is not available for purchase in the Windows Store, Microsoft’s online app store.

Gaming remains one of the most popular applications for mobile devices and computers. The lack of timely versions of top titles for its devices has been a problem for Microsoft as it tries to compete more aggressively with rivals like Apple, Samsung and Google.
By the standards of Microsoft, which had nearly $86 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of June, a $2 billion-plus deal would be relatively small. Because Mojang is a European company, Microsoft would be able to use cash from overseas operations to fund the deal, a more attractive prospect than bringing the cash back to the United States where it would be subject to hefty repatriation taxes.

A spokeswoman for Microsoft declined to comment. Mr. Persson did not respond to a request for comment.

Microsoft first approached Mojang about three months ago, interested in pursuing a deal, one of the people briefed on the discussions said. By that point, the company — and Mr. Persson in particular — had considered a sale, having received takeover approaches worth about $1 billion in the last few years.

Soon after, Microsoft made an initial offer, prompting more serious talks between the sides. Last month, Mojang hired additional advisers to assist in the discussions.

Talks are continuing between them, and an agreement could be reached by the end of the month, the person briefed on the discussions said.

While Mr. Persson is said to accept that he may not stay for more than six months if a deal is struck, Mojang is pressing to try to ensure that Microsoft retains its younger developers.

In a Q. and A. hosted on the Internet forum Reddit a year ago, Mr. Persson described growing up relatively poor. After he created the popular game, he wrote, he has earned a huge amount of money that he spends on computers, gaming consoles and traveling. “I might eventually get a driver’s license so I can buy a car,” he added."
2173,"SEOUL, Feb. 5 (Korea Bizwire) – A powerful robot vacuum cleaner caused an unlikely accident involving a Korean housewife, and required the intervention of a couple of paramedics. On January 3, a woman in her fifties had her hair sucked up into a robot vacuum at her home in the city of Changwon, South Korea.

On the day of the accident, she turned on her robot vacuum as usual, and laid down flat on the floor to rest, leaving the robot to do its job. The robot vacuum came around her relaxing on the floor, and suddenly sucked her hair into its nozzle. The vacuum stopped running one to two minutes after the sudden hair intake.

The startled housewife called 119, Korea’s emergency telephone number. Fortunately, paramedics quickly arrived at the scene, and successfully disjoined her hair from the nozzle. The housewife suffered only minor injuries.

The problematic robot vacuum had a nozzle with a roller inside, which sweeps and vacuums floors. The Changwon Fire Service Headquarters presumed that the vacuum’s sensors identified the woman’s hair as dust.

The likelihood of this type accident occurring is undoubtedly more significant in countries with a “sitting-on-the-floor” culture. Since Koreans love to rest or relax on a toasty, cleanly swept floor, exercising caution on using a robot vacuum is probably a good idea."
2179,"If you're an American and you've been watching the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong closely, you may have noticed something familiar: a number of the young demonstrators are using the same ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that became a symbol of last month's protests in faraway Ferguson, Missouri.


Hong Kong's protesters have good reason to put their hands up: police are using what many observers describe as an unprecedented level of force against the demonstrations, which are rallying against the Chinese government for reneging on its promise to grant them full democracy in 2017. While injuries in the protests have been relatively few so far, the clashes have been bad enough that Hong Kongers appear to earnestly fear the police might crack down violently, and that anxiety is showing in these photos.


It's impossible to say the degree to which protesters are using the gesture as a deliberate nod to Ferguson, or borrowing something they'd seen on the news for their own purposes, or using it coincidentally. But Hong Kongers, particularly young Hong Kongers, pride themselves on being plugged in to the world, so it is well within the realm of possibility that they followed the events in Ferguson and are now appropriating the gesture for their own use. Some of the protesters are organized within a group called Occupy Central, named for Hong Kong's Central financial district and for the global protest movement that began with Occupy Wall Street.


It's fascinating to see a symbol of the fight against racism and police violence in America become a symbol of democracy and freedom halfway around the world, however it got there."

2183,"An American woman has claimed to have had a third breast surgically added to her chest.

The 21-year-old, who calls herself Jasmine Tridevil, wants to be a reality star.

She posts videos of her daily life in Tampa, Florida, on Facebook to “show the struggles she faces because of her surgery.”

Tridevil has also claimed she had the surgery because she didn’t want to appear as attractive to men.

In one of the videos, she said: “I got the surgery because I wanted to turn off guys. I know it sounds crazy but I don’t want to date again ever. I still like to feel pretty.

“If I got a third breast implant most guys would think that’s weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty.

“I’m starting a reality show called Jasmine’s Jugs and my ultimate goal is to get it onto MTV. That’s my dream.”

Tridevil reportedly told Real Radio 104.1 that she spent $20,000 (£12,000) on the procedure a few months ago, after struggling to find a doctor who would perform the operation.

“I called 50 doctors,” she explained. “It was really hard finding someone that would do it too because they’re breaking the code of ethics.”

She claims her third breast was made using an implant and skin tissue cut from her abdomen.

The surgeon was not able to make an artificial areola, so Tridevil had one tattooed on to “look natural.”

She told the radio station that her parents did not react well: “My mum ran out the door. She won’t talk to me. She won’t let my sister talk to me. My dad, he really isn’t happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it.”

Tridevil has written on her Facebook page that she has a number of TV and radio interviews coming up, but a few days ago added: “I'm nervous as Hell. I'm prepared for people to judge harshly and tell me to kill myself lol.”

2189,"A five-year-old boy in Torpoint, England, ended up missing a friend’s birthday party, and he did it without any advance notice. Due to his no-show at his friend’s party, the young child was actually given an invoice and billed for his nonappearance.

According to the Plymouth Herald, Derek Nash says that his son Alex was given a “child’s party no show fee” invoice for not going to a friend’s birthday party. The bill for £15.95 (approx. $25) was in his son’s school bag last week and Nash “thought it was a joke.”

The party was scheduled for before the Christmas holidays when Alex was invited to one of his Torpoint Nursery and Infant School classmate’s birthday party. It was being held at the Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre, and the Nash family indicated that Alex would be attending the party.

“She saw me and asked if Alex was coming to the party. At this time I agreed and said that Alex was looking forward to it.”

As the Metro stated, Nash informed the classmate’s mother in person that his son would be going to the party. It was after that conversation that Nash realized the family already had a family trip planned for that day.

Upon trying to cancel Alex’s acceptance to the party, Nash found no way to contact the party-thrower.

“We did not have a contact number, email or an address to let [the boy’s mother] know. So on the day of the party we asked Alex what he wanted to do – he chose to be with his grandparents.”

It was a week later that the invoice for Alex’s no-show was received. A teacher at the Torpoint Nursery and Infant School is actually the one who put the notice in the boy’s school bag, and the school has since issued an apology for their involvement in the matter.

Alex’s teacher said that she would let all staff know that giving the boy an invoice was a “breach of protocol.”

Derek Nash said he then left the school and went to visit the birthday boy’s mother since her address was now on the invoice. He let her know that he “would not be paying her the money” and that “she should have spoken to me first.”

The birthday boy’s mother has since threatened the Nash family with legal action and could possibly take them to small claims court to get the money she is owed.

As for Alex Nash and his classmate at the Torpoint Nursery? He has told his parents that his classmate won’t play with him at school now since he was a no-show to the party and the invoice was given out.

2190,"Suspected for sometime by local authorities of running a pig farm functioning as an underground pig brothel, where clients paid for sexual services with the farm animals, the 67-year old farm owner was arrested with two of his sons and some 30 guests who were present to celebrate the New Year’s Eve.

Caught in full action during the night of New Year’s Eve, the FBI raid engaged more than 16 agents in what local officials believe to be the biggest crack down on an animal brothel in American history.

Hundreds of piglets were forced into sexual acts with clients of the pig brothel

The addicted 31-year-old constantly stuffs his face with the holey Swiss scoff after falling in love with Emmental while he was a student in Switzerland.

A Korean source said: “His intake has increased in recent years with the strain of being in power.”

This has prompted terrified enemies of the regime who have fled North Korea to claim his poor health is down to his expanding waistline.

Kim was spotted limping at a ceremony in the North Korean capital Pyongyang to mark the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder, his granddad KimIl-sung.

His face looked swollen and he was limping on his right leg, wearing a gloomy expression through the parade.

And Emmental, which is 45% fat, is said to be sending plump Kim to an early grave.

The despot – who rules a country where millions are starving – ordered three officials to attend a crash course in cheese making because he was furious at the quality of dairy products in the Asian state.

""We have bodies. Come and examine them,"" he said. ""It is clear they are missing certain parts.""

Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of ""crimes of genocide"" in targeting certain ethnic groups.

The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.

Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that ""it's very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day."" He used an alternative acronym for the group.

2195,"White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is denying claims that the administration threatened legal action against the families of kidnapped Americans if they paid ransom to their captors, the Islamic State.

McDonough hit a series of Sunday interview shows to promote the administration's counterterrorism plan against the Islamic State, including a plea to Congress to fund anti-Islamic State forces in Syria.

The families of James Foley and Steven Sotloff — American journalists beheaded by the Islamic State — said the government objected when they considered ransom payments, and even threatened prosecution.

""We didn't threaten anybody, but we made clear what the law is,"" McDonough said on Fox News Sunday. ""That's our responsibility, to make sure we explain the law and uphold the law.""

Ransom payments are prohibited under U.S. law, on the theory they would encourage terrorist groups to kidnap more Americans.

McDonough said he sympathized with the Foley and Sotloff families, and noted that the administration attempted a hostage rescue in Syria.

""We took every effort — and will continue to take every effort — to secure people,"" he said.

In discussing the counter-terrorism plan, McDonough urged Congress to fund anti-Islamic State fighters in Syria, and said the U.S. is ""obviously"" at war with the militant group.

The interviews aired a day after the Islamic State beheaded a third hostage, British aid worker David Haines

The plan that Obama announced Wednesday includes the prospect of U.S. airstrikes in Syria, while expanding ongoing strikes in neighboring Iraq.

Obama, McDonough, and other aides say the plan features assistance to local forces in Iraq and Syria to carry the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS.

In his round of interviews, McDonough echoed Obama's pledge to avoid using U.S. combat troops, and to rely on forces in Syria and Iraq.

""That's why the Syrian opposition is so important,"" McDonough said on CNN's State of the Union, later adding that ""it's going to be Iraqi and other boots on the ground that are bringing this fight to ISIL.""

On ABC's This Week, McDonough said that ""what we want to make sure happens is that we have committed partners who can take the fight to ISIL on the ground. And they will have not only support from us from the air, but they'll also have training and equipment support from us.""

Lawmakers and analysts have questioned Obama's plan, saying that the United States will have to get more involved — including the prospect of ground troops — if the Islamic State is to be defeated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Sunday that the Obama administration is ""delusional"" about its plan.

""It is our fight,"" Graham said. ""It's not just their fight. This is a radical Islamic army that's pushing a theory of a master religion ... It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army — they're intending to come here.""

Graham also said of Obama: ""This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed back here at home.""

Administration officials have offered different descriptions of the administrations's plan, ranging from ""counter-terrorism operations"" to outright ""war.""

On NBC's Meet The Press, McDonough said that ""as much as we've been at war with al Qaeda since we got here, we're at war with ISIL.""

It is ""a complicated effort,"" McDonough said, and ""success looks like an ISIL that no longer threatens our friends in the region, no longer threatens the United States — an ISIL that can't accumulate followers, or threaten Muslims in Syria, Iran, Iraq, or otherwise.""

Secretary of State John Kerry, who has disputed the use of the term ""war,"" told CBS' Face The Nation that ""there's frankly a kind of tortured debate going on about terminology ... What I'm focused on, obviously, is getting done what we need to get done to ISIL."""
2198,"A 17-year-old transgender girl in Ohio committed suicide by walking into traffic early Sunday morning.

Leelah Alcorn, born Joshua Ryan, left behind a harrowing note posted on Tumblr that exposed the pain, frustration and rejection Leelah felt, including her feeling that “there’s no way out,” and her concern that she would never fully transition.

Leelah died around 2:20 a.m. Sunday after she was hit by a tractor trailer near the  South Lebanon exit of I-71. While initial news reports seemed to suggest her death was an accident, her note made her intentions clear:

If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Please don’t be sad, it’s for the better. The life I would’ve lived isn’t worth living in… because I’m transgender. I could go into detail explaining why I feel that way, but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is. To put it simply, I feel like a girl trapped in a boy’s body, and I’ve felt that way ever since I was 4. I never knew there was a word for that feeling, nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl, so I never told anyone and I just continued to do traditionally “boyish” things to try to fit in.

When I was 14, I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness. After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was. I immediately told my mom, and she reacted extremely negatively, telling me that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong. If you are reading this, parents, please don’t tell this to your kids.

Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. That won’t do anything but make them hate them self. That’s exactly what it did to me.

My mom started taking me to a therapist, but would only take me to christian therapists, (who were all very biased) so I never actually got the therapy I needed to cure me of my depression. I only got more Christians telling me that I was selfish and wrong and that I should look to God for help.

When I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart. The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition. I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.

On my 16th birthday, when I didn’t receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep.

Later, she detailed her emotional turmoil.

After a summer of having almost no friends plus the weight of having to think about college, save money for moving out, keep my grades up, go to church each week and feel like shit because everyone there is against everything I live for, I have decided I’ve had enough. I’m never going to transition successfully, even when I move out. I’m never going to be happy with the way I look or sound. I’m never going to have enough friends to satisfy me. I’m never going to have enough love to satisfy me. I’m never going to find a man who loves me. I’m never going to be happy.

Either I live the rest of my life as a lonely man who wishes he were a woman or I live my life as a lonelier woman who hates herself. There’s no winning. There’s no way out. I’m sad enough already, I don’t need my life to get any worse. People say “it gets better” but that isn’t true in my case. It gets worse. Each day I get worse. That’s the gist of it, that’s why I feel like killing myself. Sorry if that’s not a good enough reason for you, it’s good enough for me.

As for my will, I want 100% of the things that I legally own to be sold and the money (plus my money in the bank) to be given to trans civil rights movements and support groups, I don’t give a shit which one. The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in schools, the earlier the better. My death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.

I want someone to look at that number and say “that’s fucked up” and fix it. Fix society. Please.

Leelah was being home-schooled at the time of her death.

2199,"TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraq’s army has shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province, a senior lawmaker disclosed on Monday.
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to a Monday report of the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
He said the Iraqi parliament has asked London for explanations in this regard.

The senior Iraqi legislator further unveiled that the government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from people and security forces in al-Anbar province on numerous flights by the US-led coalition planes that airdrop weapons and supplies for ISIL in terrorist-held areas.

The Iraqi lawmaker further noted the cause of such western aids to the terrorist group, and explained that the US prefers a chaotic situation in Anbar Province which is near the cities of Karbala and Baghdad as it does not want the ISIL crisis to come to an end.

Earlier today, a senior Iraqi provincial official lashed out at the western countries and their regional allies for supporting Takfiri terrorists in Iraq, revealing that US and Israeli-made weapons have been discovered from the areas purged of ISIL terrorists.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the Al-Ahad news website quoted Head of Al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

He noted that the weapons made by the European countries and Israel were discovered from the terrorists in the Eastern parts of the city of Ramadi.

Al-Zameli had also disclosed in January that the anti-ISIL coalition’s planes have dropped weapons and foodstuff for the ISIL in Salahuddin, Al-Anbar and Diyala provinces.

Al-Zameli underlined that  the coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“There are proofs and evidence for the US-led coalition’s military aid to ISIL terrorists through air(dropped cargoes),” he told FNA in January.

He noted that the members of his committee have already proved that the US planes have dropped advanced weaponry, including anti-aircraft weapons, for the ISIL, and that it has set up an investigation committee to probe into the matter.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations.

He noted that the committee had collected the data and the evidence provided by eyewitnesses, including Iraqi army officers and the popular forces, and said, “These documents are given to the investigation committee … and the necessary measures will be taken to protect the Iraqi airspace.”

Also in January, another senior Iraqi legislator reiterated that the US-led coalition is the main cause of ISIL’s survival in Iraq.

“The international coalition is only an excuse for protecting the ISIL and helping the terrorist group with equipment and weapons,” Jome Divan, who is member of the al-Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament, said.

He said the coalition’s support for the ISIL is now evident to everyone, and continued, “The coalition has not targeted ISIL’s main positions in Iraq.”

In late December, Iraqi Parliamentary Security and Defense Commission MP disclosed that a US plane supplied the ISIL terrorist organization with arms and ammunition in Salahuddin province.

MP Majid al-Gharawi stated that the available information pointed out that US planes are supplying ISIL organization, not only in Salahuddin province, but also other provinces, Iraq TradeLink reported.

He added that the US and the international coalition are “not serious in fighting against the ISIL organization, because they have the technological power to determine the presence of ISIL gunmen and destroy them in one month”.

Gharawi added that “the US is trying to expand the time of the war against the ISIL to get guarantees from the Iraqi government to have its bases in Mosul and Anbar provinces.”

Salahuddin security commission also disclosed that “unknown planes threw arms and ammunition to the ISIL gunmen Southeast of Tikrit city”.

Also in Late December, a senior Iraqi lawmaker raised doubts about the seriousness of the anti-ISIL coalition led by the US, and said that the terrorist group still received aids dropped by unidentified aircraft.

“The international coalition is not serious about air strikes on ISIL terrorists and is even seeking to take out the popular (voluntary) forces from the battlefield against the Takfiris so that the problem with ISIL remains unsolved in the near future,” Nahlah al-Hababi told FNA.

“The ISIL terrorists are still receiving aids from unidentified fighter jets in Iraq and Syria,” she added.

Hababi said that the coalition’s precise airstrikes are launched only in those areas where the Kurdish Pishmarga forces are present, while military strikes in other regions are not so much precise.

In late December, the US-led coalition dropped aids to the Takfiri militants in an area North of Baghdad.

Field sources in Iraq told al-Manar that the international coalition airplanes dropped aids to the terrorist militants in Balad, an area which lies in Salahuddin province North of Baghdad.

In October, a high-ranking Iranian commander also slammed the US for providing aid supplies to ISIL, adding that the US claims that the weapons were mistakenly airdropped to ISIL were untrue.

“The US and the so-called anti-ISIL coalition claim that they have launched a campaign against this terrorist and criminal group – while supplying them with weapons, food and medicine in Jalawla region (a town in Diyala Governorate, Iraq). This explicitly displays the falsity of the coalition’s and the US’ claims,” Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Brigadier General Massoud Jazayeri said.
The US claimed that it had airdropped weapons and medical aid to Kurdish fighters confronting the ISIL in Kobani, near the Turkish border in Northern Syria.

The US Defense Department said that it had airdropped 28 bundles of weapons and supplies, but one of them did not make it into the hands of the Kurdish fighters.

Video footage later showed that some of the weapons that the US airdropped were taken by ISIL militants.

The Iranian commander insisted that the US had the necessary intelligence about ISIL’s deployment in the region and that their claims to have mistakenly airdropped weapons to them are as unlikely as they are untrue."

None more so than a particularly demanding Snowy Owl in Poland, who KILLED her new boyfriend because of his tiny penis.

The bird, nicknamed the Black Widow, left her suitor half-eaten, shocking vets at the animal shelter in Knyszynska Forest.

Park keepers had noticed the owl was unhappy and decided to pair her up with a new mate.

But just two days after arriving from Germany, they found the new owl devoured and dead.

Shelter spokesman, Robert Konowal, said: ""The first two days were fine and they seemed to get on very well.

""We were horrified when we then discovered she had killed him.

""At first we couldn’t understand why but we took the remains to a vet who after examining him found that his testicle sack and private parts were underdeveloped.

""In other words, he wasn’t a suitable lover, and we assume that after failing to perform she killed him, probably out of frustration.

2216,"Fan Lung’s wife took matters into her own hands after catching Lung sending cell phone messages to his Chinese lover, Zhang Hung, who Lung now plans to marry.

A jilted wife who chopped her cheating husband's manhood off twice is facing jail.

Two-timing dad of five Fan Lung, 32, had used his wife's cell phone to send lover Zhang Hung, 21, a saucy email from his marital home in the city of Shangqiu, of central China's Henan province.

But after forgetting to log out of his account, stunned wife Feng, 30, came across the message — and several others — and flew into a rage.

Grabbing a pair of scissors she stormed into their bedroom where he was sleeping and snipped his manhood off.

But after being taken to the hospital where he had it sewn back on, fuming Feng sneaked into his hospital room and cut it off again before throwing it out of a window.

“The first we were aware of what happened was when someone came into the reception area to say a naked man was beating up a woman outside the hospital,” a hospital spokesman said.

“Staff rushed out to see what was happening and found the patient with blood streaming down his legs hitting the woman.

“He was stopped and the woman was taken in for treatment, and then we discovered she had chopped his penis off again.”

Doctors and police officers combed the area outside but failed to find the man's missing member, and they believed it may have been stolen by a stray dog or cat.

The hospital spokesman said the man had lost a lot of blood and needed emergency surgery.

He is in stable condition but “extremely emotionally distraught,” the spokesman said.

Lung’s lover, who arrived at the hospital, said she planned to marry him as soon as she could.

“It doesn't matter that he's lost his fertility,” Hung said, “he has five children already.”

Lung’s wife was charged in the gruesome attack."
2222,"Of all the Apple rumors coming out of the Far East recently, the one with the most legitimacy seems to be Apple producing an iPhone with a 4-inch display next year.

Although the reports are unsubstantiated, returning to the small smartphone market would be a good move for Apple.

According to the Electronic Times of Taiwan, the supply chain for Apple production in 2015 includes the components for a smaller handset than the iPhone 6.

The report states that Apple is producing the smaller model “for the convenience of single-handed operation of female users.”

Even though Apple has turned to the larger smartphone and phablet market with the release of the iPhone 5 and 6, respectively, there are still users who prefer the smaller screens and the ability to use a smartphone with just one hand. As phones get bigger, it becomes impossible to do even the simplest tasks without both hands.

The new phone is rumored to be replacing the iPhone 5c model. The 5c has been Apple’s budget model since its release in September 2013.

The 5c lacked many of the features of the 5s model, such as using the Apple 5 model’s A6 chip instead of the A7 that came with the 5s, not having Touch ID, lacking the M7 motion co-processor and other minor features. The iPhone 5c was discontinued in September 2014 when the iPhone 6 was announced.

According to Pocketnow, this rumor might signify that Apple wants to standardize their current iPhone models with a small (4-inch), mid-sized (4.7-inch) and phablet (5.5-inch) display. Whether the new 4-inch iPhone would be marketed as a budget iPhone is impossible to say at this point.

Apple stayed with a 3.5-inch display for five generations as its rivals grew progressively larger. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, said in 2010 that the smaller screen was better because it was easier to “get your hands around it.”

Russian man Igor Vorozhbitsyn, 41, was walking to his favourite fishing spot when a brown bear attacked him.

As the bear clawed him, Mr Vorozhbitsyn’ mobile phone went off, setting off his ringtone, Justin Beiber’s ‘Baby’, reports The Austrian Times.

At the sound of the hit Beiber track, the bear turned and fled back into the forest.

“I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I’d marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.”

“I couldn’t believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled.”

“I know that sort of ringtone isn’t to everyone’s taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,” he said.

Wildlife experts said a sudden noise can frighten animals, even in mid-attack.

“Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its tracks and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,” a wildlife experts told The Austrian Times.

After the animal fled Mr Vorozhbitsyn used his phone to call for help.

He suffered cuts and bruises from the attack and is now recovering."
2232,"The British accent in the video that depicted the despicable and cowardly murder of an American journalist has raised concerns in the UK about the background of the ISIS jihadist. The Washington Post’s report on the butchery includes this nugget that should have Americans thinking twice, too:

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country’s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

“We’re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,” Hammond said. “Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.”

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.
The May 2004 Berg killing was conducted by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Tawhid wal-Jihad at the beginning of the 2003 Iraq war, which became al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) at around the time of that beheading. US forces killed Zarqawi in an American airstrike, but AQI survived his death and the Anbar Awakening (if barely) to morph into ISIS when the US pulled out of Iraq. Berg was not the only American beheaded by Zarqawi, either; he also killed Owen Eugene Armstrong later in the same year, and both Berg and Armstrong wore orange jumpsuits when murdered, as did James Foley.

The orange jumpsuits are obviously referencing Guantanamo Bay, but the British seem concerned that there’s more than just symbolism now in play with ISIS. The US began releasing British subjects from Gitmo during the Bush administration under international pressure to shut down the facility, as well as releasing other detainees to their home countries, all of whom pledged to ensure that they would not return to the fight. We’ve seen plenty of recidivism since then, and all to this same end — to rejoin the jihad against the West and the nations in this region, and to recruit others to do the same.

It won’t be a surprise if the jihadist turns out to be a former Gitmo detainee, but it is a bit of a surprise that the UK doesn’t keep a close enough watch on those former detainees to account for their whereabouts immediately. After all, they have already been identified as threats, picked up in the battle zones far from home, which is how they ended up in Gitmo in the first place. The bigger worry for the UK — and for the US and other Western nations — will be how many of these butchers will make it back home undetected and anonymous. It should also have us taking great care not to release those who still present a danger, especially since we’re now desperately looking for ways to roll back ISIS. Perhaps we shouldn’t provide them more fighters than they already have."

Oh no! Is Hugh Hefner dead? A shocking report went viral on the internet claiming that the Playboy tycoon had passed away of natural causes at his home in the Playboy Mansion. Fans of the 88-year-old celebrity took to Twitter to sound off on their concerns.


Hugh Hefner Dead? New Death Hoax Spread On Internet
Take a huge sigh of relief because Hugh is A-ok!

The businessman made sure everyone know that he was alive and well on Dec. 29.


His wife, Crystal Hefner, also posted a picture of Hugh on the movie night. However, before Hugh’s tweet, fans expressed their worry all over Twitter.


It’s easy to see why fans would be freaking out. A website with the URL “nbctoday.co” posted the story, and it went viral across various social media sites. Many probably assumed that the link was the actual NBC TODAY site.

The site wrote:  “Hugh Hefner, Founder and chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, was found dead of natural causes Sunday morning at his home, the Playboy Mansion, in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, according to Los Angeles police officer Jimmy N. Gardner. He was 88.”

But Hugh is doing fine. He was just another victim of those crazy death hoaxes that are prevalent on social media nowadays. Good to know you’re OK, Hef!

A nine-year-old child’s seemingly heartfelt letter to her teacher after he came out as gay to the class has been celebrated by online users.

The unidentified girl apparently wrote the letter to a primary school teacher after he used his own sexuality to explain to his class why homophobia was wrong as part of anti-bullying week.

“I’d asked who’d heard ‘gay’ being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned,” the unidentified teacher told Pink News.

“Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up.”

After speaking to the headmaster of the primary school, the teacher agreed to tell his class about his fiancé in order to “explain when people use that word they’re talking about me.”

He continued: “The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson.”

The girl slipped the letter to the teacher shortly after the lesson and he claims that it “brought tears to my eyes”.

Online, users celebrated the letter with one user writing: ""Wouldn't it be lovely if everyone saw things as innocently as this little girl"".

You can read a transcript of the letter below:

Dear Mr R

“Even though you’re gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. I still think about you the same way as I used to. You’re a great teacher and these are just some of the word’s [sic] that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave.

“The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave.

“You don’t have to feel scared because I know that everone [sic] in the class feels the same way as I do.

2244,"The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are two of the more exciting products Apple has unleashed in quite some time. Of the two, differences are slight, but the camera hardware Apple went with on the iPhone 6 Plus is a good reason to stop and consider which you really want. A new rumor suggests those still standing in front of tables at the Apple Store might want to walk away for a few months, as the iPhone 6S camera might end up being even better than the iPhone 6 Plus’.

According to Money.UDN, the iPhone 6S will have a dual-lens camera. We’ve heard similar rumblings before, as Sony announced new camera hardware for mobile devices with a “dual lens”. Sony makes the camera hardware for Apple’s iPhone, so dual lens isn’t so sensational.

Optical zoom, though — that’s interesting. According to Money, the iPhone 6S will have an optical zoom feature, which is something smartphones generally slouch on. Rather than rely on digital enhancements, a hardware fix for zoom may be inbound.

As if a cool new camera wasn’t enough, the report also cites supply chain sources on pressure sensors which Apple is said to include on the next iPhone. One sensor will track blood pressure and heart rate, which makes sense for Apple’s HealthKit, but ultimately seems to clumsy for an iPhone.

iphone-6-nfc-820x420-600x307

The second sensor is even more hard to understand. Supply chain sources say that one will be made available for use with a 3D interface. We’ve seen job openings for Apple’s VR initiatives (which are kind of 3D), but it’s early on for anything 3D for an iPhone, and it’s an unlikely aesthetic change for Apple’s iOS. In the wake of iOS 7’s visual update, there’s no way Apple would go full 3D.

Finally, the report suggests Apple is ditching the 16GB iPhone base model for a 32GB version. If that’s true, good on them; it’s overdue.

Much of these rumors seem like foie gras; force-fed from patent filings and other news tidbits. A new camera is likely, and we’re sure Apple is at least entertaining the idea of dropping the underwhelming 16GB model. As for 3D or extra sensors packed into the iPhone 6S, we’re not going to bite on that one."

2253,"ESPN host Chris Fowler was duped by a fake website, MediaMass, because he failed to check his facts.

Fowler reported a series of wrong facts about Japanese tennis star Kei Nishikori, including that he is the world's highest-paid tennis star and has his own vodka line, soccer team and restaurant chain, USA Today reported. In the segment:

""You're looking at the highest paid tennis player in the male side in the world. That might be a surprise to Roger Federer fans, but Nishikori has signed up lots of companies. According to published reports, made about 46 million last year...How's he doing it? He owns Fat Nishikori burger restaurant, a football team which is soccer, his own brand of vodka, he's got a perfume, he's got a clothing line...He's got a whole lot of deals with Japanese companies.""



Despite Fowler's claim, Deadspin reported, citing Forbes magazine, that Nishikori didn't make $46 million last year but just $11 million, which ""makes him the ninth-highest paid player -- not the richest."" Forbes breaks that down as $9 million in endorsements and $2 million in prize money.

The satire site, Media Mass, had reported that Nishikori was the top paid player making $46 million, based on the (fictional) People with Money magazine.

""He owes his fortune to smart stock investments, substantial property holdings, lucrative endorsement deals with CoverGirl cosmetics. He also owns several restaurants (the “Fat Nishikori Burger” chain) in Tokyo, a Football Team (the “Matsue Angels”), has launched his own brand of Vodka (Pure Wondernishikori - Japan), and is tackling the juniors market with a top-selling perfume (With Love from Kei) and a fashion line called “Kei Nishikori Seduction,'"" Media Mass reported.

Within the article, however, in red letters, was a note saying the story was false, linking to a 2012 page describing Media Mass's project. The update, which iMediaEthics highlighted below, says it was posted Jan. 25, 2015, but it was posted when iMediaEthics viewed the story Jan. 24, so we are unsure when it was published.




That update linked to a page on Media Mass' website. ""The website mediamass.net is the medium of our satire to expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe,"" Media Mass' website states.

In ESPN's defense,  USA Today noted, ""None of the information was completely absurd — it’s not as if they said he owned four castles or slept upside down in a hyperbaric chamber or plans on being one of those people who want to take a one-way trip to Mars.""

Fowler apologized for the error on Twitter, Sports Grid noted.

2258,"It was with a healthy dose of scepticism that we brought you reports of a 21-year-old woman who allegedly had surgery to obtain a third breast.

The massage therapist from Tampa, Florida claimed to have paid $20,000 for the procedure in an attempt to secure herself a reality show on MTV.

Using an obvious pseudonym, Jasmine Tridevil told an American radio station she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found a surgeon willing to operate.

Jasmine Tridevil says she had to contact more than 50 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery

She claims the one who did agree forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect his anonymity, because he was ""breaking the code of ethics"".

Tridevil’s dubious story is not helped by the fact that all the available images of her appear to have been taken by herself, with no third parties present, and that the footage she has posted is decidedly grainy.

And now the internet sleuths of Snopes have weighed in with some pretty convincing research that indicates Tridevil may be playing the media. It points out:

'...The JASMINETRIDEVIL.COM domain was registered by someone named Alisha Hessler, and Jasmine Tridevil herself bears a striking likeness to Tampa-area massage therapist Alisha Jasmine Hessler (whose ""Alisha's Golden Touch"" massage web site now bears legends identifying her as ""Provider of internet hoaxes since 2014"" and ""Specialist in massage for three breasted women""). Photos on a modeling page linked with Hessler closely matched the circulating images of Jasmine Tridevil, and profile pictures on Hessler's YouTube page strongly resembled the woman in the ""third breast"" photos.'

Snopes also claims an Alisha Jasmine Hessler was taken into custody in Florida last year and charged with fraudulent use of personal information and that a woman with the same name has had previous brushes with viral fame.

However Tridevil continues to insist she and her three breasts are the real deal.

She told The Sun (£): “This is not a fake. I had a procedure done. If people don’t believe it, that’s up to them.”

Tridevil dreams of starring in her own reality TV show

She also claims her self-financed film crew recorded footage of her operation, adding: “I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don’t really care what people think or say about me.

“I know what I have done. As I say this is not a fake or a hoax.”

Speaking exclusively to 10 News Tampa, Tridevil obliged the channel with a ""quick flash"" of her third breast, but when asked why she wouldn't allow a closer look, replied with: ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Is a dangerous cheese addiction making Kim Jong-un seriously ill?

North Korea's demented despot dictator is reportedly ballooning in weight after getting hooked on Emmental, a cheese produced in Switzerland.

The 31-year-old is said to be importing huge quantities of the savory Swiss treat — which he first discovered while studying in the European country as a child.

Rumors surrounding his dairy dependence surfaced after he appeared on TV with a swollen face.

He also had a limp during the Pyongyang ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the death of the nation’s founder Kim Il-sung.

Dissidents who have fled the Hermit Kingdom, where millions of citizens are reportedly starving to death, said his increasing weight was affecting his health.

And they claimed he was bulking himself up in a bid to look like his grandfather.

""North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny,"" defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, told the Mirror.

2270,"After news broke yesterday that Jasmine Tridevil, 21, of Tampa had allegedly paid $20,000 to have a third boob implanted on her chest to make herself ""unattractive to men,"" we've heard whispers in the wind (and read stories) that this Third Boob is a stunt, a hoax. It very well might be. http://gawker.com/woman-gets-thi...

Professional debunkers Snopes has classified Tridevil's third boob story as ""FALSE,"" largely because almost all of the alleged evidence (photo, video) is coming directly from Tridevil herself: No family members or friends have confirmed the surgery first-hand. And Tridevil claims the doctor who performed the surgery forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, conveniently making his or her testimony unattainable. They point out that in this YouTube video posted to her page, Tridevil's alleged third boob is a different skin tone then the rest of her body.

Trivdevil granted an exclusive interview with WTSP last night, where she briefly flashed all three of her breasts. When the reporter asked for another, longer look, Tridevil declined, telling the reporter, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Yes, Tridevil purports to be self-producing a reality series she hopes will be picked up by a television network. Fitting, because according to the snoops at Snopes, this apparently isn't the first time Tridevil has tried to turn herself into a star. Well, a woman claiming to be Jasmine Tridevil, at least: jasminetridevil.com, which has since expired, was registered to a Alisha Hessler, one who bears a striking resemblance to a Tampa massage therapist that has had brushes with viral fame before.

Last year, Hessler allegedly made the man who beat her wear a dunce cap and hold a sign reading ""I BEAT WOMEN, HONK IF I'M A SCUMBAG"" in a busy intersection. Police made multiple attempts to follow up with Hessler about the incident, but she apparently refused all the calls.

And in March of 2013, Snopes reports, Hessler was booked in Tampa on a fraudulent use of personal information charge.

Doctors have confirmed that no surgeon in their right mind would allow this surgery to ever happen, namely because Tridevil/Hessler's case raises mental health red flags. Nilesh Sojitra of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons told BuzzFeed:

This is a clear case of a patient who should not have had surgery performed on her. Someone making this kind of request may have body dysmorphia disorder, or not have thought through the long-term consequences of such a surgery – she will now be scarred for life – and may have benefited from psychological evaluation rather than surgery. Additionally, the actions of the surgeon are unethical and they have acted in a way where no reasonable plastic surgeon would.

And Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery told WTSP, ""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person.""

So it would appear unlikely that the Third Boob is real. That is the ""truth."" But the truth is, we all have a third boob—our hearts. It beats when you believe in yourself. It beats when you chase your dreams. So while this Third Boob might just be a Halloween costume prosthetic used to hop on the easily started viral joy ride, the Third Boob in all of us beats on.

2282,"IS it Crabzilla or Claws? This aerial image of a giant crab lurking at a British resort has become an internet sensation.

People have been flocking to a website to judge for themselves whether this picture shows a huge crustacean in shallow water at a harbour mouth in Kent or is just an elaborate hoax.

Quinton Winter, who collates strange and spooky sightings for his Weird Whitstable website, at first thought the image sent to him by a follower showed an unusual sand formation in the shape of a crab but is now convinced it’s a true monster of the deep.

**CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE CREATURES IN DIGUISE**

He believes he saw the giant lurking close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer in the harbour at Whitstable, which is famed for its oysters.

He said: “At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood’.

“It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

“Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.”

The picture appears to show an edible crab, scientific name cancer pagurus, a species commonly found in British water but which normally only grows to 10 inches, weighing six pounds.

The biggest known crab species is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."
2285,"(CNN) —Three Afghan soldiers in Massachusetts for training who went missing were found trying to cross the border into Canada, several media outlets reported Monday.
The soldiers told customs agents they were refugees and were trying to cross the Niagara Falls Rainbow Bridge, WCVB reported.

The troops were reported missing after a trip to a shopping mall late Saturday, authorities said. It was the second time in a week that Afghan security trainees in the United States have disappeared.

Earlier this month, two Afghan police officers training with the DEA wandered off during a sightseeing trip to Georgetown, CNN affiliate WJLA reported.

They decided they wanted to stay in the United States, but authorities found them and sent them home.

The three men who went missing in Massachusetts were identified as Afghanistan National Army Soldiers Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Cpt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, and Cpt. Noorullah Aminyar.

They arrived in the United States on Sept.11 for Exercise Regional Cooperation, an annual event, the guard said, and were quartered at Joint Base Cape Cod.

Troops from six nations are participating in the exercise, which runs through Wednesday and will go on as scheduled, the guard said.

Roughly a dozen Afghan soldiers are still participating."
2289,"Updated 5:09 a.m. Wednesday:

U.S. officials say the video showing the beheading of a second U.S. journalist by militants of the Islamic State is authentic. ""The U.S. Intelligence Community has analyzed the recently released video showing U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff and has reached the judgment that it is authentic,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement Wednesday.

Original Post:

An Islamic radical group released a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had threatened Sotloff's life when it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley two weeks ago.

At the time, the militants said Sotloff's life depended on the actions of the U.S. government, which has been targeting the group with airstrikes to stop its offensive in Iraq.

SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadist groups, posted a version of the video showing a man who looks like Sotloff kneeling next to a masked fighter holding a knife.

In his regular briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""not in a position to confirm the authenticity of the video or the reports.""

""Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him,"" Earnest said. ""The United States, as you know, has dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr. Sotloff.""

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. would try to authenticate the video quickly.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act,"" she said.

Just last week, Sotloff's mother released an emotional video in which she pleaded with the Islamic State to spare her son's life.

Shirley Sotloff asked Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to grant her son amnesty, ""to use your authority to spare his life and to follow the example set by the Prophet Muhammad who protected people of the Book.""

According to The Washington Post, Sotloff, 31, was a freelance journalist covering the civil war in Syria when he was captured in 2013. On his Twitter account, Sotloff described himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami,"" whose work has been published in Time and Foreign Policy.

Sotloff's mother said he was ""an honorable man"" who ""has always tried to help the weak.""

The New York Times reports that in the video released today, Sotloff says he is ""paying the price"" for the Obama administration's airstrikes in Iraq.

A masked fighter, the Times reports, appears beside Sotloff saying, ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.""

SITE Intel Group reports that the masked fighter also threatens to execute an additional hostage."
2291,"A Florida woman — because where else? — claims to have gotten a third breast surgically implanted dead-centre on her chest.

Jasmine Tridevil (not her birth name) says she spoke with over 50 cosmetic surgeons before she found one willing to break the ethical boundaries of his profession for $20,000.

“They put a mini-implant to make it look like a nipple poking out,” she told The News Junkie, an Orlando radio show. “And for a while it didn’t have an areola but I got a tattoo.”
The motivation for the third breast was not to pay homage to Total Recall, apparently, but because Tridevil wants to become “unattractive” since she is not interested in dating anymore. This is an explanation that must have made more sense on paper.

She says she has also hired a camera crew to follow her around in the hopes that MTV will give her a reality TV show.

“I saved up for two years and I didn’t spend any of that money,” she said. “I’m dumping every penny I have into this so if it doesn’t work, I’m through.”

She also said relations with her parents were somewhat strained after she revealed her surprise surgery to them.

There is no way to confirm if Tridevil’s breast implant is real but she has been gaining thousands of Facebook and Twitter fans since the story broke Monday morning. So: mission accomplished, either way."
2292,"A massage therapist from Tampa, Fla. has spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted dead center between the right one and the left one as a way to become unattractive to men. She claims that she isn't interested in dating anymore.

Jasmine Tridevil contacted over 50 doctors before she found a surgeon who was willing to to perform the surgery to add a third breast. In an interview with local radio station Real Radio 104.1, Tridevil explained that ""My mom ran out the door. She won't talk to me. She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad . . . he really isn't happy. He is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it,"" she said.

The doctor who performed the surgery couldn't add an areola so Tridevil had one tattooed on instead. As the woman told 104.1, her biggest dream is to have an MTV reality show.

2294,"Charles Manson's 27-year-old fiancee reportedly wants to marry him so she can put his corpse on display in a glass crypt.

Journalist Daniel Simone told the New York Post that Afton Elaine Burton, aka Star, and a friend think the crypt would be a money-making draw.

But Simone says Manson doesn't want to be put on display for all eternity.

""He feels he will never die,"" Simone told the Post. ""Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.""

The couple's marriage licence expired Feb. 5, but on her website Burton says it will be renewed.

Simone says the marriage idea stemmed from Burton's crypt plan and she initially just wanted Manson to sign over his body to her. If they married, California law states Burton would get possession of the corpse.

Simone told the Post Manson has no interest in a marriage and strung Burton along to continue receiving toiletries and other items.

The Post couldn't reach Burton for comment.

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen Steven Sotloff by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,"" NSC spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. ""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The NSC's statement came within an hour after ISIL reportedly released a video showing the murder of Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist who had written for Time, Foreign Policy and National Interest. According to the monitoring service SITE Intelligence Group, Sotloff was beheaded in the same manner as James Foley, the photojournalist who was killed last month. The executioner is reportedly the same man who killed Foley and threatened to kill Sotloff in the video released on Aug. 19.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that the White House could not immediately confirm the validity of the video but that ""our thoughts and prayers"" are with the Sotloff family."
2300,"Three senior Afghan military officers who failed to return to a U.S. training base in Cape Cod have been taken into custody while trying to cross into Canada, according to news reports.

WCVB-TV Boston reports that an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" told reporter Karen Anderson, that the men were detainedat the Rainbow Bridge Canadian/U.S. border crossing hnear NiagaraFAlls on Monday.

The TV station quotes an unidentified ""high-level law-enforcement source"" for tis reports. The details could not immediately be confirmed.

NBC News, quoting ""top Massachusetts law enforcement officials, also reports the three were detained at the bridge,

The three soldiers from the Afghan National Army arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 11 to take part in a two-week training exercise at Camp Edwards, a National Guard training facility located at Joint Base Cape Cod.

They were last spotted at the Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis, about 20 miles from the base.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday that three officers did not appear to pose a threat to the public and may be trying to defect.

The Cape Cod Times, quoting an unidentified spokesman for the U.S. Central Command that is sponsoring the training exercises, reported Monday that the men were on an off-base chaperoned excursion ""to introduce them to cultural aspects of American life"" when they failed to return to base Saturday night.

Speaking to reporters, Patrick said the U.S. military does not believe the three Afghans pose a danger to the public. He said the military is investigating a number of possibilities, including that they ""might be trying to defect.""

The officers, who were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminy, are among 200 soldiers from Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia taking part in the tactical exercises at Camp Edwards.

The Cape Cod Times quotes military officials as saying base and exercise officials are working with local and state authorities to locate the men.

The U.S. Central Command spokesman tells the newspaper that the three — like all participants in the field exercises — do not have access to weapons.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady tells Boston.com that not all 200 foreign participants are locked down on the base. The officers, who are cleared by the State Department to participate in the program, are permitted to go to dinner or other activities off-base without restrictions.

The camp is a 15,000-acre area inside Joint Base Cape Cod that includes a replica of a forward operating base used by soldiers in places such as Afghanistan, according to the JBCC website.

Sahady said 15 officers and senior enlisted personnel from Afghanistan were taking part in the annual training program, which has been held since 2004. The two-week exercise is scheduled to end Wednesday.

2308,"Bart didn’t have a cat in hell’s chance of coming back from the grave — but after being buried for five days, he clawed his way back.

The miracle feline’s misfortune started when he was struck by a car and his grief-stricken owner laid him to rest.

“The cat appeared to be lifeless and the owner buried him. Five days later, the cat showed up in a neighbor’s yard — alive!” the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in Florida told ABC7.com.

The badly hurt, weak and dehydrated kitty dug himself out of the grave and crept back slowly.

Bart needed treatment for facial wounds, a broken jaw and a ruined eye — but his owner couldn’t afford a vet, so he took his pal to the Humane Society.

There is no purrfect ending yet, however, because Bart — who can’t eat due to pain — still has a lot of recovering to do.

He was scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday to wire his jaw, fix his palette, place a feeding tube and remove his destroyed eye.

Despite the difficult days ahead, the Humane Society expects that Bart will be back home soon — enjoying another of his remaining eight lives."

The report, which cited unidentified industry sources, said LG Display will be the sole supplier of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens for the Apple watches that go on sale in April.

Samsung Display will also become a supplier for the next version of the smartwatch that is expected to go on sale either sometime in the second half of this year or early 2016, the South Korean newspaper said.

LG Display and Samsung Display declined to comment on the report. Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

Apple has scheduled a special event on March 9, where it is expected to showcase Apple Watch. The watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple's first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad.

2312,"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who disappeared this weekend during a training exercise on Cape Cod have been found trying to cross the border into Canada near Niagara Falls, sources said Monday.

A top Massachusetts law enforcement officials tells NBC News that the three were caught at the famed Rainbow Bridge.

The three arrived 11 days ago with 200 soldiers and civilians from several countries for training at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. They were last seen Saturday at a shopping mall in Hyannis during a day off. Massachusetts State Police, with the help of the FBI and the Guard, had been trying to find them.

Col. Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, had told NBC News earlier, ""There's no reason to think they have nefarious intent, and no information to suggest that public safety is in question. But there's a pause for concern, because we want to make sure this wasn't planned, and we want to see if anyone has helped them."" He said because the men have visas that remain valid for the next several days, they're in the country legally.

Several officials say the widely held view is that they were trying to find some way to stay in the country. Gov. Deval Patrick today said publicly what many state and local officials say privately — that they're not considered a danger. Their disappearance follows an apparently similar event last week when two policemen from Afghanistan went missing during a DEA training program in the Washington area. They were found in New York. Earlier this month, a senior Afghan military officer slated to carry the flag for his country at a NATO summit in Wales applied for asylum in the United Kingdom upon his arrival."

His father, Jason Steward, said the family had been to see ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" last weekend. His son brought a ring to his class at Kermit Elementary School and told another boy his magic ring could make the boy disappear.

Steward said the principal said threats to another child's safety would not be tolerated – whether magical or not. Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the matter.

2319,"James Foley was courageous, and his murder by an apparently English-accented zealot of the Syria-based Islamic State was so horrific that no simple narrative can do it justice. Unless, that is, you're a conservative political opportunist of a special sort, eager to pin the crime on liberal policies.

The right wing, drunk on a fermenting rotgut of hyperpatriotism and anti-left paranoia, just knows that Foley's murderers were enabled by bleeding hearts and due process. They think they've found proof that Foley's executioner was a prisoner freed from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Maybe it was even Barack Hussein Obama himself who gave the order to free this killer!

Unnamed aggregators at Twitchy, the dittoheads who stare at tweets, were the first to round up grumblings—or perhaps hopes—among right-wingers early Wednesday that Foley's murderer was freed from the detainee pool. These tinfoil hatters took their inspiration from two anonymously sourced paragraphs buried in an early Washington Post report on Foley's murder from Tuesday:

Translation: Flummoxed U.K. intel officials were checking the murder against the usual suspects, hoping to stumble onto a clue in the tiny pool of data they already had before reluctantly wading into the murkier waters of global jihadism. That's standard sleuthing.

And it's sadly unsurprising that the Islamic State's propagandists dressed Foley up in an oversized t-shirt mimicking the infamous orange jumpsuits put on problem detainees at Gitmo; Al Qaeda in Iraq had similarly garbed several of its condemned captives in outfits imitating the jumpsuits—enduring symbols of the mistreatments, real and supposed, of Gitmo inmates.

But to Islamophobic, Gitmo-loving conservatives, these paragraphs could mean so much more:

Presumably, Tsotsoros meant the Bush administration, since it's the one that released all of the 10 British citizens that have been repatriated from Guantanamo, all between 2004 and 2007. And York's choice of ellipses is deceptive, since it implies that the Post was referring to some of those ex-detainees as Syria-based jihadists, when it also was referencing a larger pool of some 800 to 1,500 other British citizens that have traveled to fight for ISIS. (None of the U.K.'s ex-Gitmo inmates is believed to have gone to Syria except Moazzam Begg, who has been in British custody since February on charges related to his travels.)

But never let facts get in the way of a good psychotic B.S. meme. By Wednesday morning, Hot Air's Ed Morrisey was just asking questions, and the game of right-wing telephone was on:

By Wednesday night, the Gitmo link had become ""likely"" on conservative Twitter:

The rumors, like hot sludge on a city street, had trickled down to the lowest internet gutter:

And the rumors mutated into straight-up, demonstrably false partisan bullshit:

And hey, where did the Islamofascists get that orange jumpsuit anyway? Isn't that federal government property? You can't just buy that stuff, right?

Let me reiterate: Whatever hype you may hear, no U.K. Guantanamo detainee released by this administration is responsible for this reprehensible murder, because this administration hasn't released any U.K. detainees from Guantanamo.

Is it remotely possible that one of the 10 Gitmo detainees with British citizenship released by the Bush administration has slipped off into Syria and become an executioner? I don't know the whereabouts of all of them, so I can't say no for sure. But it's astronomically less likely than the possibility that ""Jihadi John,"" as the Brits are calling Foley's presumed killer, is any one of several hundred other disaffected Syria-based zealots with U.K. passports—like, say, this doctor's brother, or any of these idiots, all of them younger than the Gitmo releasees.

About the only thing that's certain is that conservatives—who cleave to simplistic, manichaean narratives like ornery toddlers to security blankets—must have a villain, even if they have to create it.

""I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and he fled,” Vorozhbitsyn told the Croatian Times.

Vorozhbitsyn, 42, was walking to his angling spot when a bear ambushed him from behind.

""I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me,"" he said.

Vorozhbitsyn was able to call for help on his phone and was rescued by fishermen.

Vorozhbitsyn said he has his granddaughter to thank for his ringtone selection.

First there was the report that her personal doctor, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, performed a biopsy on her vocal cords, a procedure experts say should have been performed at a hospital, not an outpatient surgery center such as Yorkville Endoscopy. Rivers reportedly did not consent to the biopsy.

Then it was revealed the clinic doctor who performed Rivers’s endoscopy, gastroenterologist Lawrence Cohen, no longer works for Yorkville. There have been conflicting reports about whether he resigned or was fired. A spokesman for the clinic told The Wrap: “Dr. Cohen is not currently performing procedures at Yorkville Endoscopy, nor is he currently serving as medical director.”

And now, an unnamed source claims Rivers’s personal doctor took a selfie while she was under general anesthesia, according to a report by CNN. Rivers’s doctor remains unnamed, and the alleged selfie has not yet surfaced in news reports.

Rivers entered Yorkville Endoscopy in New York City on Aug. 28 for a procedure to determine why she was hoarse and her throat was sore. She stopped breathing when her vocal cords began to swell during the biopsy and went into cardiac arrest. Rivers was put in a medically induced coma and died at Mount Sinai hospital on Sept. 4 at age 81. Initial autopsy results from the New York Medical Examiner’s Office were deemed inconclusive."

According to TechCrunch, multiple sources that include ""several prominent employees at Apple and Beats"" have confirmed that Apple is shutting down the music service.Many engineers from Beats Music have already been moved off the product and onto other projects at Apple, including iTunes. It's not clear when exactly Jimmy Iovine and Dr Dre's music service will be shut down or what Apple will do with streaming, but every source with knowledge of the situation that we talked to agreed Apple plans to sunset the Beats Music brand.Apple first acquired Beats Music in May, and at the time, announced plans to leave the music service untouched. There were no plans to integrate Beats Music into iTunes, with the company suggesting that it would remain as a standalone service.

2331,"Production is ""gearing up"" for the upcoming launch of the Apple Watch, according to a fresh report from Digitimes.

Industry sources indicate that as many as 40 million units of Apple's custom chip have been ordered to prepare for initial shipments. These numbers suggest that the Cupertino tech giant is expecting high global demand for its innovative smartwatch.


Along with those high production stats, however, come potentially high prices for consumers. When the Apple Watch was first revealed in September, the base model was announced at a $350 for an aluminum band. This is well over $100 more than similar products from competitors like Sony and Motorola. The ever-looming Apple tax doesn't stop there either.

Apple Watch stainless steel bands could start as high as $500, says French Apple blog iGen.fr, while wealthy buyers hoping to purchase a solid gold band for their Apple smartwatch may have to shell out as much as $5,000. French pricing schemes may vary widely from what we see on day one in the United States, so the accuracy of these figures is still up for debate. Fans of Apple products are used to paying higher prices for premium goods, and that trend seems to be alive and well in the company's latest product.

For those wondering when the Apple Watch hits store shelves, a recent rumor report from Business Insider pegs a release as soon as Valentine's Day 2015. That date is supposedly an optimistic one, however, so officials at Apple are more inclined to stick to a tentative spring 2015 time frame.

As production enters its heaviest phases, Apple seems ready to tackle the watch industry in full force. What remains to be seen, is if the company's first massive chip order will be enough to satisfy consumer demand.

Is the Apple Watch high on your wish list? Would you pay thousands of dollars for a top-tier band? Tell us your thoughts in the comments!"
2333,"Playboy boss Hugh Hefner has denied reports that he is dead and said the rumours were 'greatly exaggerated'..

There were recent rumours on the Internet that the 85-year-old had passed away after suffering a heart attack.

A story claimed Playboy magazine would be printed as usual after his death and a Playmate even spoke out about his life.

Love: Hugh Hefner with his then fiancee Crystal Harris who he broke up with just days before his wedding. he has since found a new mate

But soon after the story started to be picked up by several different news outlets, the Playboy founder took to his Twitter page to confirm he is still alive.

He wrote: 'The rumours of my death are, as Mark Twain observed in a similar situation, greatly exaggerated. I'm very much alive & kicking.'

Shera Bechard, 27, French-Canadian model and fledgling actress and now Hef's girlfriend

And to prove how much alive he was, he added: 'I'm lying in bed next to Shera with a big smile on my face, reading tweets about my unexpected demise.'

Shera Bechard is his 24-year-old girlfriend.

Many confused tweeters sent messages about his apparent demise with @WolfesMother writing: 'Weird rumour doing the rounds...Hugh Hefner has gone to the big mansion in the sky?! Prob just a rumour, cause he's immortal right?!'

Moments after his 'death' was reported, the ageing lothario's name was a trending topic on Twitter.

Hefner has not been out of the papers of late, more recently for his very public break up with his former fiancée Crystal Harris shortly before their wedding was due to take place.

Harris cites infidelity on Hefner's part, Hefner said it was the other way around. He has since rebounded with Shera Bechard.

The eternal bachelor did not seem as if he were about to die from heart break however.

He has already replaced Crystal with more than one girlfriend and he has openly spoken of his excitement about watching an upcoming programme about his wedding-that-almost was.

Girlfriends: Hef with Kendra Wilkinson, Bridget Marquardt and Holly Madison while promoting E!'s reality TV show Girls Next Door

After he confirmed that he was still alive, he wrote: 'The guys and I watched an early edit of Hef's Runaway Bride tonight. The fans are going to love it.'

Hefner launched the Playboy empire in 1953 which he financed by selling his furniture and gathering about $8000 from 25 investors.

He has been married twice and has four children. At one point, he had seven girlfriends who all lived in the Playboy mansion with him, spawning the hit E! TV series The Girls Next Door, which starred playmates Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson-Baskett and Bridget Marquardt.

2335,"Tampa, Florida -- She's an Internet sensation: Jasmine Tridevil, the 21-year-old Tampa woman who claims to have had a third breast implanted. Her video on YouTube has almost a million hits and her pictures on Facebook have gone global.

10 News spoke with her in an exclusive interview.

""I figured people would be skeptical, but it's true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,"" said Tridevil.

She agreed to the interview on the condition we only discuss her self-produced show she hopes will be picked up by a cable network, and when we asked to see her third breast, she obliged, but with only a quick flash. When asked her why we couldn't have a longer look Tridevil responded, ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

Some of the comments from the public have been cruel. Tridevil says she predicted that, but she is willing to do whatever it takes to be famous. Dr. Dan Greenwald of Bayshore Plastic Surgery in Tampa says that raises a lot of red flags.

""I think its very extreme, and that leads me to wonder why she needs this attention. Is there some instability? Is there something psychologically lacking or out of balance for this person,"" said Greenwald.

And Jasmine's reaction to that.

""I saw it coming.""

2339,"(CNN) -- The ISIS terror group has published a video titled ""A second message to America,"" showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff.

The video also threatens the life of British captive, David Haines.

Sotloff speaks to the camera before he is killed, saying he is ""paying the price"" for U.S. intervention.

The masked ISIS figure in the video speaks to U.S. President Barack Obama, telling him, ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.""

Last week, Sotloff's mother Shirley Sotloff released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill her son.

""Steven is a journalist who traveled to the Middle East to cover the suffering of Muslims at the hands of tyrants. Steven is a loyal and generous son, brother and grandson,"" she said. ""He is an honorable man and has always tried to help the weak.""

Sotloff appeared last month in an ISIS video showing the decapitation of another American journalist, James Foley. The militant in the video warned that Sotloff's fate depended on what President Barack Obama did next in Iraq.

Steven Sotloff disappeared while reporting from Syria in August 2013, but his family kept the news secret, fearing harm to him if they went public.

Out of public view, the family and a number of government agencies have been trying to gain Sotloff's release for the past year.

Sotloff, 31, grew up in South Florida with his mother, father and younger sister. He majored in journalism at the University of Central Florida. His personal Facebook page lists musicians like the Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Miles Davis and movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" as favorites. On his Twitter page, he playfully identifies himself as a ""stand-up philosopher from Miami.""

In 2004, Sotloff left UCF and moved back to the Miami area.

He graduated from another college, began taking Arabic classes and subsequently picked up freelance writing work for a number of publications, including Time, Foreign Policy, World Affairs and the Christian Science Monitor. His travels took him to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey -- among other countries -- and eventually Syria."
2346,"Path CEO and founder Dave Morin. Is Apple is close to a deal to buy the social networking company Path?

Apple is close to a deal to buy Path, the social networking company that bills itself as ideal for close friends and family, according to the news site Pando Daily, which cited a single unnamed member of Apple's engineering team.

The acquisition report buttressed speculation inspired by the fact that Path co-founder and CEO Dave Morin was in the front row at Apple's big product unveiling event Tuesday and posted a photograph of himself with Dr. Dre,. The rap star is co-founder of Beats by Dre, the headphones maker and music streaming business that Apple bought for $3 billion in August.

Morin declined to comment one way or another onstage at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference Wednesday.

Well known Internet entrepreneur Jason Calcanis, however, commented on Morin's presence in a newsletter he dispatched Tuesday evening saying a deal is plainly on the table.

""Dave Morin was chilling in the first row of the event two seats from Johnny Ive and — I think — next to Dr. Dre. That means one thing and one thing only: Path and the team are going to Apple. You don’t get that first row seat by accident,"" Calcanis wrote.

San Francisco-based Path was founded in 2010 and has raised about $67 million, including a $25 million round disclosed in January. Though featured repeatedly by Apple and lauded for its aesthetic sensibility, its app has struggled in the U.S. marketplace, and Morin acknowledged Tuesday that Path has ""been through a lot of ups and downs.""

He emphasized, however, Path has found significant success in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The Path app now has 5 million daily active users globally, and a separate messaging app the company released in June called Path Talk has more than a million daily active users, he said.

""We've got a vibrant and very happy community,"" Morin said.

Morin also expressed optimism for a new service it is developing that will enable users to message agents who will contact businesses for information and then message users with answers.

Such positive developments follow a tough 2013. That year, Path had layoffs in October and the Federal Trade Commission in February fined the company $800,000 for illegally collecting information about children without their parents consent. Also as part of that trade commission deal, Path settled an FTC complaint that it had downloaded personal information without permission, including contacts, from users' mobile phones.

The company stopped the both practices that were part of the FTC inquiry and apologized."
2350,"UNITED NATIONS (CBS News/CBSDC/AP) — Iraq’s ambassador to the United Nations asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday to look at allegations that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is using organ harvesting as a way to finance its operations.
Ambassador Mohamed Alhakim told reporters that in the past few weeks, bodies with surgical incisions and missing kidneys or other body parts have been found in shallow mass graves.
“We have bodies. Come and examine them,” he said. “It is clear they are missing certain parts.”
He also said a dozen doctors have been “executed” in Mosul for refusing to participate in organ harvesting.
Alhakim briefed the council on the overall situation in Iraq and accused ISIS of “crimes of genocide” in targeting certain ethnic groups.
The outgoing U.N. envoy to Iraq, Nikolay Mladenov, told the council that 790 people were killed in January alone by terrorism and armed conflict.
Mladenov noted the increasing number of reports and allegations that ISIS is using organ harvesting as a financing method, but he said only that “it’s very clear that the tactics ISIL is using expand by the day.” He used an alternative acronym for the group.
He said Iraq’s most pressing goal is to win back the vast territory that ISIS has seized in the past year. The Sunni militants seized a third of both Iraq and neighboring Syria and imposed strict Sharia law.
“Especially worrying is the increasing number of reports of revenge attacks committed particularly against members of the Sunni community in areas liberated from ISIL control,” Mladenov said.
Sheikh Ahmed Aburisha is a tribal leader from Anbar province in Iraq, 85 percent of which is under ISIS control. In late January, he visited Washington to urge the U.S. to give his tribes weapons and money so they can defeat ISIS in Anbar.
“Vice President Biden and Gen. [John] Allen have a clear picture of what is happening in Iraq and Anbar and what type of support is needed for the fighters in Anbar,” Aburisha told CBS News’ Jennifer Janisch. “We have received promises and we hope that these promises will materialize in reality on the ground.”

But as the bear was beginning to inflict serious injury on Vorozhbitsyn, his cellphone rang, and the ringtone of Justin Bieber hit ""Baby"" startled the animal, causing it to beat a hasty retreat.

2355,"Women with attractive eyes may be forced to cover them up under Saudi Arabia's  latest repressive measure, it was reported yesterday.

The ultra-conservative Islamic state has said it has the right to stop women revealing 'tempting' eyes in public.

A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, said a proposal to enshrine the measure in law has been tabled.

'Tempting' eyes: Muslim women could be forced to cover up even their eyes if a 'right' of the Saudi state is enforced

Women in Saudi Arabia already have to wear a long black cloak, called an abaya, cover their hair and, in some regions, conceal their faces while in public.

If they do not, they face punishments including fines and public floggings.

One report on the Bikya Masr news website suggested the proposal was made after a member of the committee was attracted by a woman’s eyes as he walked along a street, provoking a fight.

The woman was walking with her husband who ended up being stabbed twice in the hand after the altercation.

The virtue and vice committee has repeatedly been accused of human rights violations.

Founded in 1940, its function is to ensure Islamic laws are not broken in public in Saudi Arabia.

In 2002, the committee refused to allow female students out of a burning school in the holy city of Mecca because they were not wearing correct head cover.

The decision is thought to have contributed to the high death toll of 15.

They are also banned from driving by religious edict and cannot travel without authorisation from their male guardians.

In September, a Saudi women sentenced to 10 lashes for defying the driving ban was only spared when King Abdullah stepped in to stop the public flogging.

Also in September, the king announced that women would be given the right to vote for the first time and run in the country's 2015 local elections."

Rivers was put into a coma, and died on September 4

The doctor performing a biopsy on Joan Rivers’ vocal cord as she went into cardiac arrest allegedly took a selfie photo with the comedian while she was under anesthetic in the procedure room.

The physician hasn't been publicly identified, but is described as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician.

A member of staff at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators about the doctor's questionable behavior, a source close to the death investigation told CNN.

Details of how emergency services responded to the star's unexpected cardiac arrest at a clinic in New York have emerged, allowing a timeline to be constructed of the cardiac arrest, which proved fatal.

Rivers, 81, had checked in for a routine throat procedure at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28, when her condition took a shocking turn for the worse.

She had to be put of life support, and died on September 4, prompting an outpouring of grief from the world of showbusiness.

Now, almost three weeks after the incident, a New York city official has revealed exactly how the different emergency services fought to save her, and that she was surrounded by rescuers within ten minutes.

The official told CNN that the response began with a 911 call from the clinic, which was given the highest priority.

The fire department were first to arrive at the clinic, five minutes after the call.

Medical staff were already trying to give Rivers CPR using a defibrillator and a breathing tube.

The firefighters then took over the attempts to revive her.

Two minutes after the firefighters came, an ambulance arrived at the clinic, whose paramedics helped with the CPR.

Almost immediately after that, another Fire Department vehicle arrived with medical aid, making a total of more than 10 people fighting to save her.

Rivers was taken from the clinic to Mount Sinai hospital in Manhattan, where she later died.

New York health authorities have launched an investigation into her death, amid speculation as to the exact nature of the procedure she was undergoing and who was treating her.

A director of the clinic has also resigned in the wake of the celebrity's death.

Loggers Accidentally Cut Down World’s Oldest Tree in Amazon Forest

Illegal loggers at the frontier of the Peruvian and Brazilian border have mistakenly cut down what experts claim is the world’s oldest tree after allegedly not noticing ….




Detailed Analysis


Report Claims World's Oldest Tree Cut Down By Loggers
According to a report that is circulating rapidly via social media and email, illegal loggers working near the Peruvian and Brazilian border have mistakenly cut down the world's oldest tree.

Supposedly, the loggers did not realize they were working in an Amazon Indigenous reserve and cut down a giant Samauma tree that was estimated to be over 5,800 years old.

The story is causing a good deal of angst and outrage as it travels.

Report is Fiction - Comes from Fake-News Site World News Daily Report
However, the claims in the story are untrue. There are no credible reports that support the claims in the message.

The story comes from the fake-news 'satirical' website World News Daily Report.  None of the stories published on the site are valid and its material should not be taken seriously.

The site suggests that its material is 'for entertainment purposes only'.  However, its stories are presented as news articles and there are no clear disclaimers that reveal that the material is fictional.

Thus, many people believe the information published on the site and pass it on in good faith.

The image used in the story was taken from earlier reports discussing deforestation in the Amazon.

Of course, trees can reach quite amazing ages with one spruce tree in Sweden thought to be around 9,550 years old. Other trees around the world are also thousands of years old.

Deforestation is a very serious issue, but spreading nonsensical reports about it will do no good.

Best To Verify Circulating Stories Before Sharing
Many fake-news 'satire' websites have appeared in recent years. Between them, they churn out an endless stream of nonsense, much of which is shared via Facebook and other social media sites.

It is thus wise to verify any 'news' stories that come your way before you share them. It is normally quite easy to check a circulating story by searching online"
2359,"Claim: Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil underwent surgery to add a third breast.

UNDETERMINED

Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2014]

""A WOMAN has spent $20,000 on surgery to get a third breast and her dream is to become a celebrity.""

Well, this has 'What does Snopes say?' written all over it!

Origins: On 22 September 2014, a strange story of body modification appeared on the social web. According to several circulating articles, a Florida woman named Jasmine Tridevil underwent cosmetic surgery to add a ""third breast"" to her body.

In the initial frenzy of interest in Jasmine Tridevil and her purported third breast, lots of linking and re-posting of the same information and images occurred. However, few looked very deeply at the claims made by the woman shown in the images or her agents, or whether such a modification was even feasible.

A New York article about the woman's third breast reveals a potentially relevant aspect of Tridevil's claim. According to the site, the Florida woman claims her surgeon forced her to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and therefore the obvious avenue of corroboration for her claim is closed off:

The 21-year-old massage therapist claims she had to ask over 50 doctors to perform the surgery, which involved taking skin tissue from her abdomen and adding a silicon implant. She also got an areola tattooed on. The procedure cost $20,000, and Tridevil had to sign an NDA so couldn't disclose what doctor performed it.

As Jasmine Tridevil's claims about a third breast circulate the social web, most information being reported appears to come directly from the subject herself without any external confirmation. Tridevil's Facebook page and YouTube account appear to be the primary source for verification, despite the fact that both host only self-taken videos and photos. In one clip posted by Tridevil, her ""breasts"" appear to be of an entirely different skin tone than her facial skin and limbs:

Another red flag in Tridevil's tale is her stated motivations. Surgeons are ethically bound to decline performing cosmetic surgery on patients without certain mental health clearances (i.e., ensuring that patients do not have unrealistic expectations or motivations driven by psychological disorders), and in an interview Tridevil made the rather bizarre claim she set out to make herself look less attractive to men by opting to get a third breast implant:

I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men. Because I don't want to date anymore ... Most guys would think [the extra breast is] weird and gross. But I can still feel pretty because if I wore makeup and cute clothes, I can still, you know ... feel pretty.

Jasmine Tridevil's third breast tale has a few other potential inconsistencies. Despite claiming to have undergone an incredibly rare procedure, she does not go into detail about the operation or state whether she had her other breasts enhanced to match the third one. No third party images of Tridevil have emerged, and while she claims to have booked appearances on Jimmy Kimmel Live and Inside Edition , no evidence has emerged to suggest that any media sources have vetted the story.

We have submitted a request for an interview with Jasmine to verify her claim and have not yet received a response.

2363,"“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” Head of the committee Hakem al-Zameli said, according to the Arabic-language information center of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.

The incident was reported by foreign and alternative media but not mentioned by the establishment media in the U.S. Europe.


Hakem al-Zameli, a senior Iraqi legislator, added that the current government in Baghdad is receiving daily reports from security forces in al-Anbar province about flights airdropping weapons to ISIS.

He said the U.S. wants to promote chaos in Iraq and does this by supporting the Islamic State.

Other Iraqi lawmakers are complaining about the situation.

“We have discovered weapons made in the US, European countries and Israel from the areas liberated from ISIL’s control in Al-Baqdadi region,” the al-Ahad news website quoted the head of the al-Anbar Provincial Council Khalaf Tarmouz as saying.

Weapons made in Europe and Israel were also discovered in Ramadi, Tarmouz said.

“The US drops weapons for the ISIL on the excuse of not knowing about the whereabouts of the ISIL positions and it is trying to distort the reality with its allegations,” he said.

In December Iranian state media claimed U.S. military aircraft dropped weapons in areas held by the Islamic State for a second time.

Infowars.com reported:

Iraqi volunteers fighting against IS in the Yathrib and Balad districts in Iraq’s Salahuddin Province reported the air drops.

Iraq claims it now has the upper hand in the battle to regain territory from the terrorist group.

In October a purported errant airdrop of weapons fell into the hands Islamic State fighters outside Kobani in Syria.

In November Iraqi intelligence sources said the U.S. is actively supplying ISIS with weapons.

“The Iraqi intelligence sources reiterated that the US military planes have airdropped several aid cargoes for ISIL terrorists to help them resist the siege laid by the Iraqi army, security and popular forces,” a report stated.

“What is important is that the US sends these weapons to only those that cooperate with the Pentagon and this indicates that the US plays a role in arming the ISIL.”
In July, Infowars.com reported on the large amount of U.S. weapons captured by ISIS.

In addition to combat ground vehicles and artillery previously acquired from the Iraqi military, the trove taken form U.S. bases included more than 50 155mm M-198 artillery batteries and 4,000 PKC machine guns.

The acquisition of sophisticated weapons converted ISIS from a terrorist group into an army capable of waging conventional war in Iraq and Syria."

“Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for preservation of American lives and interests, so why is it that I am paying the price of your interference with my life?” the writer says calmly as the black clad militant holds a knife casually at his side.

The video then cuts to the militant who says that as long as U.S. missiles “continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.”

The camera cuts again and the militant appears to kill Sotloff.

Mother of American Hostage Pleads With ISIS 'Caliph' for Mercy

Video Appears to Show Beheading of Journalist James Foley

Last week Sotloff’s mother, Shirley, issued a videotaped plea directly to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, asking him to spare her son.

Sotloff was seen alive last month at the end of a very similar video that appeared to show the execution of American journalist James Foley. In that video, the militant told President Obama that Sotloff’s life was in his hands.

Similarly, today’s video ends with the militant threatening the life of a man identified as David Cawthorne Haines, a British citizen.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said today the White House could not confirm the video’s authenticity, but said, “our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff’s family.”"

Yorkville's medical director Lawrence Cohen, who has since been let go from his post, was the one originally performing the endoscopy on Rivers. It is believed Cohen then stepped aside to let Rivers' personal doctor — who was not authorized to practice at the clinic — perform the unauthorized biopsy that ultimately caused her to go into cardiac arrest.

Push the first button and the machine tells you how many times. When the bear sank his teeth into my chest and bit this button. ""Eight forty. Forty eight ... ""- said in a metallic voice my machine. Beast scared and ran away.
Still not really understanding what had happened, and waiting for a new attack, Igor few minutes lying on the ground. Everything is quiet. Rose. Oh, the horror! Bear almost took the scalp and the skin on the left side of the face, left deep lacerations on his stomach and chest, broke a vein in his right hand - there was gushing blood. How could, hand tied it with rags, but blood continued to ooze. Wounded and bleeding, being careful of the new bear attack, he moved for some reason in the opposite direction from winter quarters and soon completely lost. Night fell on the taiga. Escaping from the rain, cover the broken beast cloak. Very sick and dizzy. Somehow I pulled out his match. Tried to start a fire, but fingers did not obey. Suddenly spurted from the wound and the blood flooded matches.
Spent the night under a tree, listening to every rustle. At dawn, he went on. When the forces finally left, lay down on the ground and crawled. Sometimes got up and staggered moved on. When before the next overnight lay down to rest, suddenly, not believing himself felt the smoke of a fire ...
Two fishermen from Neryungri standing camp here, just picked up on the hands of out-of-darkness bloody Igor. Without delay, immediately put the wounded man in the car and rushed to the nearest village Khatymov. From there, the ambulance - Neryungri. Four hours of operation, and three surgeons literally collected on parched face bloodied pieces Igor. Then - three operations already in the Republican Hospital in Yakutsk. Fortunately, the fisherman left eye was saved. Igor saved and that the first shot hit on the head is not (bear paw easily cut out the skull), and a backpack. Played a protective role and dense coat. Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman. But by a happy coincidence did not touch the internal organs and even ribs broken. And if not for mobile ...

Bear claws and teeth left serious wounds on his stomach and chest fisherman.
While doctors saved Igor Vorozhbitsyna hunters looking for a bear attacked him. Evoty literally combed the neighborhood with dogs. And on July 26 shot clumsy 2-3 years old.

According to sources who have fled the Communist dictatorship, Jong-Un is ballooning in weight and is even walking with a limp.

In North Korean culture, being fat and overweight is considered a sign of wealth and good luck, hence why it's believed that Jong-Un is bulking up on weight for that very reason.

Others believe it's so that he can look more like his grandfather and found of North Korea, Kim Il-Sung.

We could all be wrong and maybe Jong-Un is bulking up so he can start his weight-lifting career and fight Obama in a one-on-one battle royale like he's always going on about.

2380,"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab.

The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water.

While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax.

Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier

The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier.

It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches.

The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town.

Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep.

Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer.

He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"".

Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax

'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws.

'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank. Now I know better.'

The largest known species of crab is the Japanese spider crab, which can measure more than 12ft."

With all eyes on Saudi and crude right now, speculation and conspiracy theories immediately emerged on social media concerning the news. Here are two of the most interesting hypotheses I've seen:

This is a way to get oil prices to go back up without the Saudis appearing to give in and defend price by voluntarily cutting supply. A pipeline explosion will automatically decrease production.
The US Elections are over, time for prices at the pump to go back up now. This plays on the long-tenured theory that gasoline prices tend to be lowest right before elections as the incumbent party leverages their power to please the masses.

Argentina passed the law because the belief in the curse became so widespread that families were abandoning, putting up for adoption and in some cases killing their seventh sons, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tawil's parents wrote Fernandez a letter asking her to take on Tawil as her godson, to which she agreed in a ceremony she described to her Twitter followers as ""magical.""

Many media reports described Tawil as a boy, but The Guardian said he's 21.

Editor's note: This story was updated to include The Guardian report that Tawil is 21 years old."
2383,"Cristina Kirchner, the president of Argentina, has ""adopted"" a Jewish boy in order, according to legend, to prevent him from turning into a werewolf.

Yair Tawil, 21, was born in the Argentine city of Rosario, the seventh son of Shlomo and Nehama Tawil.

Under Argentine legend – which reportedly originated in Tsarist Russia – any seventh consecutive son will grow up to become a werewolf. Any seventh daughter will become a witch.

The belief in the myth was so strong that, centuries ago, the seventh child was often put to death.

In 1907, in a bid to counter the myth, Jose Figeroa Alcorta, then-president of Argentina, became the godfather of José Brost, the seventh son of a Enrique Brost and Apolonia Holmann who had emigrated from Russia.

In 1973 President Juan Domingo Perón formalised the tradition of presidents becoming godparents to the seventh son or daughter, and a year later the ruling was enshrined in law. Those affected by law 20.843 – ""The Law of Presidential Godfathership"", were entitled to presidential protection, a gold medal and a scholarship for all studies until the 21st birthday.

But the ruling only applied to Catholic families, and so in 1993 Mr and Mrs Tawil wrote to the president asking for the honour to be extended to their son, Yair.

The request was denied. But in 2009 the law was changed to apply to all – regardless of their religion.

And just before Christmas, Mrs Kirchner met with Yair, who became the first Jewish godson of a president in Argentina's history.

The president in her tweets and photos described to her 3.4 million Twitter followers a ""magical moment"" with a ""marvellous family."" She described Yair as ""a total sweety,"" and his mother a ""Queen Esther.""

She tweeted that the Tawils ""are a very special family. They have a sort of peace, happiness and a lot of love that is not common.""

Twitter: Cristina Kirchner - Es una familia muy especial. Tienen como paz, alegría y mucho amor. No es común. Buena vibra. http://t.co/QILUC11xR4

Mrs Kirchner adopted her first ""godson"" in 2008. In 2012 she adopted another, Natanael Eric, who was also born in Rosario, and last year three more boys – all of them born in the northern province of Santa Fe.

The Argentine president had been due to usher in the New Year with a visit to the Vatican, to see her compatriot Pope Francis.

2392,"SHE made headlines around the world when she revealed she paid thousands of dollars to get a third breast surgically attached to her chest.

But now Florida woman Jasmine Tridevil is facing claims that the surgery is a fake and she made it all up.

The claims come as an American news channel 10 News revealed Tridevil, who goes by the real name Alisha Jasmine Hessler, had filed an incident report after losing a three breast prosthesis earlier this month.

Tridevil filed the report after her bag was stolen from Tampa International Airport on September 16, with the report also obtained by TMZ.

The luggage, which was stolen, allegedly contained a fake breast and 10 News obtained the report which listed the missing contents including a “3 breasts prothesis”.

However, Tridevil claims she underwent her surgery a few months ago and it cost $20,000.

Internet rumour site Snopes also uncovered her JasmineTridevil.com site is registered to Alisha Hessler, someone who Tridevil bares striking resemblance to.

However when 10 News reporter Charles Bill tracked her down, Tridevil insisted her surgery and third breast were the real deal.

“I figured people would be sceptical, but it’s true. I recorded the surgery and it will be on my show,” she said.

Tridevil insisted the surgery went ahead and she tried 50-60 doctors before she found one willing to perform the surgery.

Surgeons have also dismissed the possibility of it being real.

New York plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman told The Daily Dot: “[I] believe 100 per cent that this is a hoax that everyone is falling for,” he said.

“I would be happy to go on record claiming that this is a falsified story and essentially not possible.”

Michigan surgeon Dr Anthony Youn agreed while the surgery was possible, it was highly unlikely anyone would perform it.

In a YouTube clip Tridevil said the extra breast felt like her other two but that “the only difference is the nipple”, which she had to get tattooed on.

The 21-year-old saved up for two years so she could have the surgery and is also paying for a film crew to follow her around.

She also said her surgery was documented by a film crew and will prove her story is true, The Mirror reported.

Tridevil has received plenty of venom on social media and just hours ago posted “Pain is temporary, glory is forever” from her Facebook page.

Just an hour earlier she wrote: “Don’t be afraid to be different ... that’s what makes you beautiful” and also posted a photo of her pre surgery which won her a host of compliments and questions as to why she would want to change.

“Omg ... I done know what is happening but I'm seriously going viral right now,”

It’s not the first time Ms Hessler has made headlines.

Last year, she chose to publicly humiliate a man who beat her instead of sending him to prison.

She said she was introduced to the man when friends of hers invited him out clubbing last December and he beat her after unwanted sexual advances.

She received hospital treatment and a police report was filed.

But instead of pressing charges she offered her attacker an ultimatum telling him, “I can either press charges and have you arrested for a year, or I can have you sit outside at a busy intersection for 8 hours holding up a sign that says ‘I beat women’.”"
2393,"Apple and LG seem to have a trusty, healthy relationship on display. Not only has the Korean technological giant outfitted Apple's premium iPad tablets with their high-resolution displays, but the latest word on the subject is that the relationship will continue for the Apple Watch as well! JP Morgan analyst JJ Park claims that LG is the sole supplier of the wearable's flexible Plastic OLED screen.

LG has been on the forefront of this technology, going as far as to produce flexible lighting panels made entirely of plastic. So Apple's demands shouldn't be a problem for LG's display arm, although it has quite a bit of work cut out for it with Cupertino gearing up to ship 26 to 29 million watches this year, and another 61 million next. This will generate billions of dollars (and trillions of Korean wons) of revenue for LG, but other analysts think Apple will ship just 8.5 million watches, so let's not juggle the big numbers already.

LG aside, Apple's dream team of component suppliers for the iWatch includes Quanta (EMS), Samsung (application processors), ASE (system-in-package modules), Amkor and STATS ChipPAC. This thing packs in much more technology than it seemed at first glance.

The Apple Watch's release is expected in April, with two different sizes and various price tiers at bay. More news as they come!"

He has been seen walking with a limp, raising speculation it may be gout

31-year-old imports vast quantities of Emmental - his favourite variety

His weight has ballooned in recent months and he now walks with a limp

But experts think weight gain may be deliberate to look like late grandfather

After more than a week of speculation, North Korea has finally admitted its 'Dear Leader' is poorly - sparking new rumours he may have gout.

Kim Jong-un, whose weight has ballooned in recent months thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese, has been struck down by a mystery illness, his henchmen in Pyongyang revealed today, saying only that he was 'suffering from discomfort'.

It comes after the 31-year-old vanished from his usual role as centrepiece to the isolated country's propaganda machine after last appearing in public at a concert with his wife on September 3, fuelling speculation he is suffering from bad health.

He had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on Thursday appeared to have difficulty walking.

Unwell? Kim, 31, who is frequently the centrepiece of the isolated country's propaganda, has not been photographed by state media since September 3, fuelling speculation he is unwell. He has also been seen walking with a limp

'The wealth and prosperity of our socialism is thanks to the painstaking efforts of our marshal, who keeps lighting the path for the people, like the flicker of a flame, despite suffering discomfort,' a voice over for the hour-long documentary said.

The documentary was followed by a pre-recorded broadcast of a North Korean Supreme People's Assembly meeting from which Kim Jong Un was notably absent.

Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show.

North Korea observers speculate Kim's weight and family background may have contributed to his condition.

'Disease of Kings': Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle

'Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something (due to) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,' said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website.

Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle.

The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people.

Men are more likely to develop gout than women because their uric acid levels rise during puberty and remain higher than women through adulthood.

It usually first appears between the ages of 30 to 60 and becomes more common with age.

The condition is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in the joints such as the big toe.

Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down chemicals in the cells known as purines.

If you produce too much uric acid or excrete too little when you urinate, the uric acid will build up and may cause needle-like crystals in and around the joints, most commonly in the foot (particularly the big toe), but also the knees, fingers, forearms and elbows.

The crystals may spill over from the joint cartilage into the joint space, causing a painful attack.

Foods naturally high in purines include red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork - seafood, especially shellfish and oily fish, and offal.

'It is protein-rich foods that cause gout,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Cheese is not a high risk food, although eating a lot of it will mean he is likely to have high calcium – and cholesterol – levels.'

Other risk factors include obesity - partly because of extra pressure on the joints and chemical changes as a result of the fat - and heavy alcohol consumption, particularly beer, which is high in purines, and spirits.

Smoking is not generally seen as a risk factor for gout.

The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp.

Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic.

Kim has not been a presence in state media since attending a Pyongyang concert on September 3.

There's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian North's media.

North Korea's official Korean Central Television says the Supreme People's Assembly approved the promotion of Hwang Pyong So as the vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission.

Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat.

Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror.

North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung.

He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s.

Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny.

'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'"
2395,"Jim Suva with Citigroup this evening weighs in with what to expect from the March 9th media event in San Francisco that Apple (AAPL) announced today, an event that is likely focused on Apple Watch, given that, as he points out, Daylight Savings Time starts the day before, March 8th, so the tag line of the event, “Spring Forward,” is an apt time reference.

Suva, who has a Buy rating on Apple, and a $135 price target, lays out the prospects for details about the watch, including pricing:

We expect Apple to give specifics on the launch time, price, and geographic locations, which we estimate as: Launch date: April 16th; Price points: $350, $550 and $950; with a launch limited to the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia in the subsequent months. A flurry of fashionable accessories including various colors and materials (plastic, leather, and metal, including high-end metals such as gold, silver and platinum), starting at $29 and ranging over several hundred dollars. We expect features to include Apple Pay, adjustable notifications due to personal frequency and preferences, Apple Health, variable haptic feedback, and battery life of one day (under normal use). Purchase locations to be Apple retail stores and Apple online store only. Hundreds of applications immediately available upon release, ranging from social, financial, health, sports and news etc.

Apple is more likely to benefit from continued iPhone 6 sales, Suva opines. Still, the WTch is among things that expand its addressable market:

We do note Apple is actively expanding its total available market (watches, payments, automotive etc). We expect Apple to sell 3.1M watch units in the June qtr, with a F12M est of 17.1M watch units.

Apple stock on Thursday closed up $1.62, or 1.3%, at $130.41."
2396,"The Apple Watch will go on sale in March, and though component shortages may be an issue, about 5 million of the devices are likely to be sold in the first quarter, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo.

Apple hasn’t given a launch date for its first smartwatch, which it unveiled in September, only saying to expect the device in early 2015. In addition to Kuo’s research note, however, other reports also have said the watch will be generally available in March.

Before the device becomes available, Apple will reveal additional information on the watch, including battery specifics and pre-order details, said Kuo, according to a story on the website MacRumors. Apple has said the smartwatch will need nightly recharging, but hasn’t offered other battery information.

Component issues may cause supply problems for the watch, Kuo said. Even with possible component shortages, Apple will sell 2.8 million Apple Watches in March and go on to sell 5 million devices in the first quarter of 2015, he said. Kuo called for iPhone shipments for that quarter to exceed 61 million units and iPad shipments to come in at 10 million units.

Apple will also launch a 12-inch MacBook Air that quarter, said Kuo. The ultra-thin notebook will run Intel’s Core M chip and feature the high resolution Retina display."

2402,"Claim: A ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats is heading towards Florida.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via e-mail, January 2015]

Would like to confirm latest fantastical story making the rounds on Facebook: Ghost ship filled with Ebola-ridden rats heading for Florida.

Origins: On 7 January 2015, the entertainment web site World News Daily Report published an article claiming a ghost ship filled with Ebola-infected rats was heading towards Florida:

A large cargo ship originating from West Africa has the American authorities on high alert as it is approaching the coast of Florida. All 17 crew members of the Guinean Luck are reported to have died from the ebola hemorrhagic fever and the presence of thousands of rats possibly infected with the disease aboard the ship could represent a major threat for the American population.

The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico. Six days after leaving the port of Freetown, the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola, and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help. This was the last time that the crew was heard of, and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later.

""We are determined to protect the American population from this unique threat"" says coast guard commander, James Fitzgerald. ""There is no way we are going to let those disease-ridden rats set foot in the USA. We're gonna find that ship and we're gonna sink it!""

The fictitious World News Daily Report article contained fabricated photos, made-up mathematical measurements, and imaginary quotes from invented officials. These dubious details gave the story an air of authenticity, and many readers took to social media to spread news of the ghost ship's impending arrival.

But there is no truth to the above-quoted story. World News Daily Report is a fake news site, and its disclaimer notes all articles published on the web site are for entertainment purposes only:

2416,"A stray cat from Canada, who was born with both male and female genitalia, is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Mittens has to have the surgery to correct bowel and urinary tract issues.

“I’d like for it to be a female, but it really doesn’t matter,” owner Colleen Clarke-Murphy told Canada’s CBC News. “I think it’s got both personalities, so it really don’t matter.”

The Newfoundland resident says her daughter found Mittens as a stray and brought her home. But one trip to the veterinarian in October was all it took for Murphy to discover that there was more to her kitty than met the eye.

Murphy was shocked to find out that her new kitty was in fact a hermaphrodite. The vet explained that Mittens would have to have the surgery to allow the confused cat to go to the bathroom without any problems.

Murphy didn’t think twice about coughing up the cash to give her feline the procedure it needed.

“She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,” she told CBC.

The vet says Mittens will be both spayed and neutered before the reconstructive surgery takes place."

She said she had to see countless doctors before finding one who would do the surgery. The procedure cost $20,000, she told the radio station.

Tridevil has aspirations to be a reality star, and hopes to get a show on MTV.

When asked about her new addition, she told the station that ""to me it just feels like another boob. The only difference is the nipple, that doesn't feel like the other ones.""

Her parents, though, apparently did not take the news in stride.

""I told my mom on camera,"" she told the station. ""(She) ran out the door.""

2426,"CAMP EDWARDS – A high-ranking source tells the Cape Cod Times that the three Afghan soldiers have been located at the Canadian border, apparently seeking asylum.

The source has been briefed on the issue, but could not be quoted on the record because he was not authorized to speak.
U.S. Central Command could not immediately confirm the information.

The Afghan soldiers went missing Saturday at Cape Cod Mall in Hyannis.

Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady said the three men were reported missing on Saturday night after traveling into Hyannis that day.

""They didn't report back (to the base),"" Sahady said. ""There is no indication they pose a threat to the public.""

The three men were identified as Maj. Jan Mohammad Arash, Capt. Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Capt. Noorullah Aminyar.

There are 200 soldiers and civilians participating in the seven-day event at Camp Edwards on Joint Base Cape Cod. Along with 12 other members of the Afghanistan National Army, the three men were all engaged in the joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies that involved civilians and officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said.

There were six nations, including the U.S., participating in the exercise, which is ongoing and is scheduled to wrap up by Wednesday. They were housed on the base and all participants at the exercise were vetted by U.S. Central Command, Sahady said."
2427,"According to a report late Tuesday, Apple is on the verge of announcing an acquisition of social network and corresponding app Path, possibly in a bid to restart a branded platform after the failure of Ping.

As reported by Pando Daily, a source with knowledge of the matter claims an agreement between Apple and Path is ""essentially a done deal."" The publication cites one person currently working for Apple in unnamed engineering department.

Interestingly, the source says Apple is looking to keep Path intact following the rumored buyout, a tactic that strays from the company's usual M&A tactics. Save for the recent acquisition of Beats, Apple usually performs so-called ""acquihires,"" or purchases made for talent, not a brand name. The publication speculates that Path may make its way into iOS Messages.

Pando Daily also points out that Path cofounder Dave Morin was seen sitting in the front row at Flint Center for Tuesday's iPhone 6 keynote. Apple saves those seats for high-ranking executives and special guests. For example, during the presentation, Jony Ive was seen sitting with design superstar and new Apple employee Marc Newson.

Pricing went unmentioned, but the struggling social networking firm's recent round of funding reportedly clocked in at a sub-$400 million valuation, much less than a rumored $500 million valuation sought by executives. Further, Path is not a high-ranking title in the iOS App Store and currently sits below the top-1,000 downloaded apps.

Aside from being one of the less popular social networking services, Path had a few missteps that drew scrutiny from governmental regulatory agencies and even Apple itself. In 2012, the firm was dinged for uploading users' address books without permission, claiming the automated action was meant to more easily find other friends using the app. The issue snowballed into a U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigation, which was ultimately settled for $800,000 in early 2013.

On the day Path's settlement, a researcher discover a flaw in the app's backend that geotagged photos uploaded by users. The problem was quickly patched, but shortly thereafter Path was again accused of unacceptable contacts handling techniques.

Despite its troubles, Path has been featured in the iOS App Store and most recently broke off its in-app messaging feature as a standalone app called Path Talk."
2428,"It wasn’t very long ago that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was treating talk of expansion as though he was being asked if he’d like an epidemic of Ebola.

But recently the nature of the rhetoric has changed so much that the question is becoming not if, but when.

And then the ultimate question. Will they be able to limit the number of new teams to just two?

Sources close to the situation have indicated Las Vegas is a done deal, the only thing to be determined being which owner will be entitled to proclaim that he brought the first major league sports franchise to Sin City.

And given how dead set against a team in the gambling haven the commissioner was 10 years ago, this move into another player friendly state-tax-free zone represents a considerable about-face indeed.

But people have been betting on hockey games for years and to pretend games couldn’t be fixed just as easily anywhere as in Vegas is pretty ridiculous, so that posturing has fallen by the wayside.

A new team close to the newly renamed Arizona squad and California’s big three is all but assured, the only question being when and with which other city. Or should that be plural?

With all the activity going on in the Seattle area in the last little bit it would be quite a stretch to imagine that much time and effort being spent by so many wealthy men being frittered away for nothing.

At the moment there are no surefire plans to build a new rink, but that could change at any time with Vancouver billionaire Victor Coleman among many reportedly showing interest in putting an NHL team into the city.

And Bettman hasn’t been visiting there to see if it really does rain a lot.

It’s been 15 years since the NHL expanded — and given there are 16 teams in the east and just 14 in the west, taking in two more teams would certainly seem to make a lot of sense, the same amount of sense it made when realignment was first announced.

And expanding without the players getting their mitts on any of the money other than the increase in payrolls is surely tempting, at least to those owners who remember the hefty cheques they cashed for Columbus and Minnesota.

Whereas before the commissioner balked at expansion, this is a sample of his more recent verbal footwork:

“There’s a lot of interest. We’re hearing from multiple groups in Seattle and in Vegas and Kansas City and Quebec City,” Bettman said to the Tribune while scoping out Target field in Minny for yet another trip to the well of outdoor games.

“We have not decided to engage in a formal expansion process but we listen to expressions of interest. It’s not something we’ve seriously considered yet.”

Like hell it isn’t. They’d have to be nuts not to be thinking about it seriously.

And since then things have changed for a commissioner who hates to move teams in his league no matter how dire the circumstances might appear — one of the most likable aspects of his regime for most hockey fans. Once the league comes to your area, it is going to stay through thick, thin and the almost impossible, as seems to be the case in Phoenix.

But could that long-standing policy and loyalty change with the Florida situation? True there’s a lease until 2028, but with the Panthers bleeding money, even the city of Sunrise can’t seem to see the point of carrying on much longer, so perhaps one of these new cities could get an existing team after all.

And while Kansas City isn’t really likely to be a serious contender in this expansion soup unless they’re going to stretch it to four teams, saying no to Quebec City in favour of two more U.S. cities with no proven NHL backgrounds is almost certainly not going to happen.

Going back to Minnesota has been a success, and there’s no question there’s more money and corporate backing than ever before in Quebec. Even an expansion team there in a new arena would be virtually assured of sellouts into perpetuity.

There will be all manner of bleating about there being insufficient talent, of course, but even if it’s true, after such a long wait this trivial detail — which only troubles the fans — isn’t going to get in the way of a financial windfall like this.

And any time the league decides it could use talent, they can start doing away with most of the coaches they employ whose chief calling in life is to devise ways to stop offensive players and choke the very life out of the game that’s paying their salaries.

Expansion will be happening, and soon. The only question is how many new cities will be involved."
2429,"BUTTE, Montana -

Robert O’Neill, the former United States Navy SEAL who shot and killed Osama Bin Laden, had his home mistakenly invaded by members of a street gang this morning shortly after 1AM. O’Neill was uninjured, the five intruders all suffered injuries and remain hospitalized, but are expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released in anticipation of the oncoming media storm.

Butte Police Commissioner Bartholomew S. Harrington told members of the Associated Press in a brief press conference that the five men, part of a local street gang connected with the infamous Crips, were seeking to collect on a drug debt and invaded the wrong house, with the intended target just so happening to be the next door neighbor of O’Neill’s.

“Mr. O’Neill had just turned in for the night, but was awoken by a loud crash when his backdoor was abruptly kicked in. As the five thugs ran aimlessly through the home, Mr. O’Neill used silent hand-to-hand combat tactics to individually disarm them of their weapons. Once Mr. O’Neill had taken down the five men and secured his home, he brewed a pot of coffee and called the police station. Those boys sure did find the wrong house!” commissioner Harrington said as he chuckled.

O’Neill had little to say on the matter when Butte Daily Times journalist Kevin Williamson interviewed the celebrated war hero.

“It was nothing really. Those kids didn’t have their mission planned out properly and hit the wrong target. I hated to break their wrists and dislocate each of their knees like I did, but it was necessary in order to immobilize the invasion. I hope they get the money that is owed to them once they get out of jail and decide to live better lives. My main concern is getting my back door fixed. Those boys really did a number on the door jamb,” O’Neill stated.

The neighbor who was the intended target seems to have abandoned home and has not been found by police. According to the men in custody, the debt was over a $50 bag of marijuana."
2430,"Iraqi forces reach centre of northern city of Baiji in attempt to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery

Authorities in Iraq were tonight investigating claims that the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been “critically injured” in US-led air strikes, prompting speculation of his death.

The death of the elusive leader would mark a significant change in the US-led effort to curtail the Islamist extremist group. Britain’s chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, warned, however, that the Isis leadership would regenerate even if Baghdadi had been killed.

General Houghton told the BBC: “I can’t absolutely confirm that Baghdadi has died. Even the Americans themselves are not yet in a position to do that. Probably it will take some days to have absolute confirmation.”

Friday’s strikes destroyed an Isis convoy near the Iraqi city of Mosul, but US officials said it was unclear whether the group’s top commander had been in any of the 10 targeted vehicles. Tribal sources told the Saudi news channel Al Arabiya that after the strike Isis members scrambled to transport the wounded to al-Qaim hospital which was overwhelmed with the injured.

Meanwhile, Iraqi military forces reached the centre of the northern city of Baiji on Sunday, trying to break the Isis siege of the country’s biggest refinery, outside the city. This led to fierce fighting. Sunni insurgents had seized Baiji in June, during a lightning advance through northern Iraq. Since then, they surrounded the refinery and halted its production, while a detachment of government troops inside has held out for months under siege.

An Iraqi colonel said troops had entered Baiji, a city of about 200,000 people, from the south and west and took over the al-Tamim neighbourhood and city centre. Isis had placed bombs along the roads and deployed snipers to keep the government forces from advancing – tactics used in other cities held by the ultra-hardline Sunni group, which controls swathes of both Iraq and Syria."
2435,"It's a safe bet that Sheikh Motlab al Nabet, spokesman of Saudi Arabia's religious police, isn't a fan of Cole Porter. ""The lure of you"" is precisely why Nabet announced yesterday that the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice will cover any women's eyes that are deemed ""tempting."" ""The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes, especially the tempting ones"" he said. ""[We] have the right to do so.""
What are ""tempting"" eyes? One Saudi journalist mused on condition of anonymity that they are ""uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup. Or even without makeup, if they are beautiful, the woman will be in trouble."" The Orwellian-named committee did not provide a definition of tempting, but if they happen to rely on Merriam-Webster, then it means ""having an appeal."" What is an appeal? According to the dictionary, it is ""arousing a sympathetic response."" And what is sympathetic? ""Showing empathy,"" according to Merriam-Webster.

So there you have it. To allow a women's eyes to capture the unfettered glory of the world, one must empathize with her very existence. But the religious police--massively funded by King Abdullah--cannot do this. ""It's so stupid,"" the Saudi journalist tells me. ""I don't know what to say. They have to stop this. Many people will oppose this in the country. They won't be silent.""

Perhaps they won't be, but the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice has some of the most powerful backers in the country. Prince Naif, recently appointed heir to the throne, has said: ""The committee is supported by all sides ... It should be supported because it is a pillar from Islam. If you are a Muslim, you should support the committee."" No surprise, then, that King Abdullah awarded this draconian body an additional 200 million riyals (about $53 million) in March.

How should America respond to this latest affront to Saudi women? Perhaps it can sponsor a contest of the most tempting eyes in Saudi Arabia. Women will send in pictures of their most tempting look and the winner will get to accompany President Obama during his next meeting with the Saudi dictator.

If Congress reconsidered the recent $60 billion U.S.-Saudi arms deal, the religious police might quickly find it ""tempting"" to stop treating women as property."

Because, as it turns out, there are still two McDonald's locations selling the long-since-discontinued Italian-ish treat. So maybe there's still hope for Jason Alexander.

It's not quite public knowledge how the two locations (located on the Ohio-West Virginia border in the towns of Pomeroy, OH and Spencer, WV) still have access to the McPizza; an employee at the West Virginia location has said that ""it’s the same pizza as they sold when [she] started there 11 years ago and it’s presumably the same that children everywhere enjoyed throughout the 1990s,"" according to Canada.com.

2439,"The 81-year-old comedienne was supposed to only have a routine procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28, but it took an ultimately fatal turn. Her personal doctor paused to snap a self-portrait while she was under anesthesia, CNN reported.

Joan Rivers’ personal doctor stopped to take a selfie in the procedure room while the famous comedienne was under anesthesia, just moments before she went into cardiac arrest, CNN reported Tuesday.

Rivers, 81, was getting a routine scoping of her throat at Yorkville Endoscopy Aug. 28 when her own physician performed an unplanned biopsy on her vocal cords, a source told the Daily News.

The procedure sent the famed funny woman into a death spiral.

A staff member at the Upper East Side clinic told CNN that the personal physician — who was not authorized to practice medicine at the private facility — paused to snap a self-portrait.

Rivers was at the clinic for a routine endoscopy by gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen.

Cohen has since been let go by the clinic. Rivers’ personal physician has not yet been named.

Rivers died Sept. 4 at Mount Sinai hospital. She never regained consciousness after the botched biopsy."

""According to the karma of past actions, one's destiny unfolds, even though everyone wants to be so lucky,"" read the Tweet, which was posted on an account using Bonet's name. ""Nothing stays in the dark 4ever!""

Was Bonet – who played Cosby's daughter, Denise, on The Cosby Show from 1989 to 1992 – addressing the numerous sexual assault allegations against the 77-year-old comedian? (The actor has denied the claims through his lawyer.)

The answer: No, she was not.




""Lisa Bonet has no social media of any kind,"" her manager tells PEOPLE exclusively.

""Any posts made in her name were made by impersonators with unverified accounts. She also has no comment on the ongoing story.""

The fake Twitter account has since been suspended.

Bonet isn't the first of Cosby's Huxtable family to speak out. Raven-Symoné (who played Cosby's step-granddaughter, Olivia, on the show) took to social media last week to deny rumors that she was one of his victims.

""I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show!"" she posted on her Instagram. ""I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of! Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!"""

2461,"Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

2462,"Egyptian President General Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has offered Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas the chance to create a Palestinian state in the Sinai Peninsula, according to local Israeli media.

The offer to the Palestinian President which, reports say Abbas has denied, would have seen 1,600 square kilometres of the Sinai Peninsula given to the Palestinian Authority, creating a Palestinian state five times the size of Gaza.

According to IDF Radio, the offer would see Abbas relinquish demands that Israel return to the 1967 borders.

In the new and enlarged Gaza, the territory would be demilitarised and Palestinian refugees, many who were unable to return to their towns after the creation of Israel, would have been able to settle there.

As part of the proposal, Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank would have been autonomous and continued to be under Palestinian Authority control.

Sisi allegedly said to Abbas in the meeting: ""You are now 80 years old, if you don't accept this proposal, your successor will.""

The Palestinian Authority is yet to publicly comment on the initiative but unnamed sources said that Abbas rejected the deal in a meeting with Sisi.

The Israeli military radio station said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had knowledge of the offer and that the United States had given its approval to such an idea.

An idea along the same lines was introduced years ago by Israeli academics but Egypt rejected the proposal.

Elsewhere, the future of a unity government between Abbas' Fatah and Hamas remains uncertain after the Palestinian president voiced his displeasure at the Islamist group's ""shadow"" leadership of Gaza.

""We cannot continue working with Hamas this way. There are 27 undersecretaries of ministries who are running the Gaza Strip, and the national unity government cannot do anything on the ground.

""We won't accept the continuation of the situation with Hamas as it is now and in this shape,"" he said. ""There must be one authority and one regime.""

Gaza is still recovering from a 50-day conflict which saw more than 2,100 Palestinians killed as well as 66 Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli civilians.

2464,"The cameras on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus may be some of the best on the smartphone market, but they could be trumped by the camera on the next iteration of the iPhone. Though the next phone -- possibly the ""iPhone 6s"" -- isn't expected for another eight months, sources within Apple Inc.’s supply chain in Asia have detailed a “dual-lens” camera module, according to Chinese publication UDN. Such a feature would improve the camera’s low-light performance and could also aid in optical image stabilization.

Apple has long used a single lens with a five-element design on its cameras. Minor camera upgrades on each new generation of iPhone have kept consumers satisfied. But in 2014, the manufacturer introduced a bigger update: optical image stabilization and phase-detection autofocus on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera on the iPhone 6 Plus in particular is said to be on par with the image quality of point-and-shoot cameras. The iPhone 6 did not get that feature.

Now, Apple may provide the next iPhone with its largest camera upgrade in Apple’s history. Information out of Apple’s Asia supply chain has often been reliable in the past, and tallies with prior reports suggesting that Apple will put a camera in the new iPhone that will rival the image quality of DSLR cameras. Daring Fireball's John Gruber said in November that Apple is working on a “weird two-lens system” for a future iPhone.

Devices like the HTC One M8 include a dual-lens camera, created by the Israeli startup Corephotonics. But Apple usually uses lenses by Sony.

The ""iPhone 6s"" may also implement a feature called Force Touch, according to the Taipei-based touch module supplier TPK. Force Touch lets the Apple Watch interpret different levels of pressure for different actions; a user can press heavily on the smartwatch screen to open an options menu, and then use a light tough to select an option. The Apple Watch is expected to launch sometime in March."

2482,"19-year-old Iga Jasica of Poland began making headlines recently after the rumor got out that she accidentally awoke during brain surgery to enjoy a friendly conversation with the surgical staff about cats. Though only part of the story is true, we’re sort of thrilled to be able to report that it’s the part about the mid-brain surgery conversation about cats. Iga revealed on her Facebook page Saturday that her temporary consciousness during the procedure was actually all part of the plan.

The teen told well wishers that when it came to the publications sharing her story, many “articles have a lot of mistakes.” She explains that far from being a shock to her doctors, “waking me up was deliberate – This method is called Awake Craniatomy. It was deliberate and planned.”

Jasica even provided readers with a link to the website of University Hospital Southampton where the surgery is described in detail. “An awake craniotomy is an operation performed in the same manner as a conventional craniotomy but with the patient awake during the procedure. This is a preferred technique for operations to remove lesions close to, or involving, eloquent (functionally important) regions of the brain. This allows us to test regions of the brain before they are incised or removed and allows us to test patient’s function continuously throughout the operation. The overall aim is to minimise the risks of such operations,” it says.

Despite the fact that her brain was indeed exposed during the waking parts of her surgery, neurosurgeon Dawid Larysz recently assured The Daily Mirror that Jasica would not have been able to see or hear anything. “Despite coming round, she didn’t feel anything and was never in danger,” he said.

Jasica herself later commented, “I can’t remember much, but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. I missed Christmas because of this operation, but it is the best present I could have had, as I am now feeling great.”

She stresses on her Facebook page that the “operation was successful and there was nothing damaged.” The teen says it’s important to her that people know that the “Doctors saved my life” and encourages readers to “not be influenced by stupid articles.”

Otherwise the 19-year-old seems to be progressing well in her recovery and is looking forward to healthier days. Whether or not she’s decided to seize the opportunity to regale countless future strangers with bad jokes about being the “brains of the operation” she has yet to reveal."
2484,"TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry (BB.TO: Quote) (BBRY.O: Quote) shares rose more than 3 percent on Monday after a news website said Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group (0922.HK: Quote) might offer to buy the Canadian technology company.

Benzinga.com, citing an unnamed source familiar with the matter, said an offer worth $15 a share could come as early as this week.

Lenovo and BlackBerry said their companies did not comment on rumors and speculation.

Rumors of a Lenovo bid for BlackBerry have swirled many times over the last two years. Senior Lenovo executives at different times have indicated an interest in BlackBerry as a means to strengthen their own handset business.

The speculation reached a crescendo in the fall of 2013, when BlackBerry was exploring strategic alternatives.

Sources familiar with the situation however, told Reuters last year that the Canadian government had strongly hinted to BlackBerry that any sale to Lenovo would not win the necessary regulatory approvals due to security concerns.

BlackBerry's secure networks manage the email traffic of thousands of large corporate customers, along with government and military agencies across the globe. Under Canadian law, any foreign takeover of BlackBerry would require government approval under the Industry Canada Act.

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told Reuters in February 2012 that he wanted BlackBerry to grow ""as a Canadian company."" And in December 2011, then-Industry Minister Christian Paradis referred to the company as a ""Canadian jewel.""

Analysts also have said any sale to Lenovo would face regulatory obstacles, but they have suggested that a sale of just BlackBerry's handset business and not its core network infrastructure might just pass muster with regulators.

BlackBerry's long-struggling handset business turned a profit before special items in the last quarter, after the Waterloo, Ontario-based company concluded its three-year restructuring program.

However, BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen has said he sees the handset business as core to the company for now, as it will foster sales growth over the next few quarters until the software and services business begins to generate new revenue streams in the first half of 2015.

Shares of BlackBerry were up 3.4 percent at $9.81 in early Nasdaq trading. Its Toronto-listed shares were up 3.1 percent at C$11.03.

2486,"Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, says a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure adding a breast to her body. 'This is not fake,' she insisted. But a police report shows she once lost 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in stolen luggage.

She apparently took everyone for a boob.

A 21-year-old Florida woman who claimed she had plastic surgery to place a third boob on her rack claims said she's no hoaxer.

But an incident report filed with the Tampa International Airport Police Department shows that she was carrying 'a 3 breast prosthesis' in luggage stolen from her in early September.

“This is not a fake,"" Jasmine Tridevil told the Sun in an interview posted Tuesday. ""I had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them.""

The publicity-hungry Tridevil, who hopes to land a show on MTV, told the British newspaper that a film crew recorded her $20,000 procedure.

The massage therapist claims to have seen at least 50 doctors before finding one who would perform the procedure.

""I plan to release it on my reality TV show and I don't really care what people think or say about me,"" she told the Sun. ""I know what I have done. As I say, this is not a fake or a hoax.""

Since Tridevil has failed to provide any real proof, many are skeptical about her wild claim, straight out of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger cult favorite ""Total Recall.""

She did give a Tampa TV station ""a quick flash,"" but wouldn't show more because ""I'm not ready to do that right now because it's in episode six of my show.""

She may not have helped her cause with a bizarre interview with an Orlando radio station last week.

""Well, I am crazy,"" she told the ""The News Junkie"" show. ""Crazy people don't know they are crazy, so technically since I know I'm crazy I'm not crazy.""

Police said the three-boob device was spotted after Tridevil's luggage was stolen off an American Airlines conveyor belt. When cops caught the suspects after identifying them on surveillance footage, investigators listed the prosthesis with Tridevil's belongings before they were returned.

Tridevil also appears to have a questionable past. In March 2013, when she was calling herself Alisha Hessler, she was busted for identity theft for using a fake ID at a Florida bar.

""She stated, 'I got it off of Craigslist for $20,'"" read the police report obtained by the Daily News. ""I asked her if she knew the female on the identification and she replied, 'no, not at all.'""

And in December, Hessler was lectured by cops after she shamed Florida man Gabriel Urena into standing in the street with a sign reading: ""I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag"" after he allegedly groped and beat her.

She also forced Urena to wear a dunce cap, but in return she dropped the charges, ABC Action News reported.

2491,"n a most horrific form of child abuse, young children in a school in Ekurh, Johannesburg, South Africa, were caught imitating the cruel sport of dog fighting, while other students placed bets on who the winner would be, reports iolnews.com.

Inspector Wendy Willson, from the special investigations unit at the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA), was called to a school in Springs in June to intervene, when a school principal noticed a pattern of children as young as eight-years-old returning from recess, injured and with their clothes torn.

Willson stated the children had been taught the disgusting action after adults, on weekends, would encourage them to watch dog fights and role play fights of their own with other children. The youngsters would get down on all fours and scratch, bite, bark and kick each other. The winner of the match would then get to ""mate"" with a child as a reward. It was unknown if the children actually had sexual intercourse. That was done in imitation of the winning dogs mating with the female dogs.

Willson stated while watching one video, if she closed her eyes and listened to the children fighting, the growls, barks, etc. sounded exactly like dogs in a canine dog fight.

As the children get older, Willson stated they become involved in the thefts of dogs, their training and in fights. One child was recorded as saying:

“It makes me feel like laughing. It makes me feel powerful.""

During her investigation, Willson could find no other examples of such egregious horror except in the Gauteng Department of Education school district.

Teddy Bear Clinic director Shaheda Omar, a non profit dedicated to helping abused children, also stated it was first time she had ever come in contact with children role playing dog-fighting, but addressed it as an extremely disturbing act:

""These children are being used. They are like cogs in a machine. I’m sure some sort of reward is offered and they are being socialized into that behavior. Violence begets violence and the children are learning it from adults.”

As if dog fighting isn't bad enough for the canine victims of this egregious activity; now children are being taught."
2493,"A Russian man was recently able to fend off a bear attack with a Justin Bieber song.

Forty-two year old Igor Vorozhbitsyn was recently fishing in Russia's Yakutia Republic when he was attacked by a bear.

During the ordeal Vorozhbitsyn's phone -- which has Bieber's ""Baby"" as the ringtone -- went off, causing the startled bear to run away.

While some might argue the pop song has the ability to repel animals, wildlife experts say the bears might not have anything against Justin Bieber, per se.

The volume of the ringtone is probably what stopped the attack.

One expert told Central European News that an unexpected noise, like a ringtone, can stop an angry bear in its tracks."
2494,"North Korea leader Kim Jong-un is so fat from eating cheese that he has broken his ankles.

The tubby tyrant is recovering from surgery after weight gain caused him to fracture his joints.

Metro reports that daily binges on Emmental are believed to be responsible for the his rapid weight gain.

An unnamed source told South Korea's largest newspaper Chosun Ilbo: ""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended.""

The source added that the 31-year-old dictator had undergone an operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members."
2499,"The highly anticipated Apple Watch, which has had a mysterious official launch date, is finally going to be released in April.

Tim Cook revealed the timing of the release of the Apple Watch during a conference call with analysts, clarifying the exact month of the device's launch, which Apple previously said would be in ""early 2015.""

""Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule,"" said Cook. ""We're going to be thrilled to start shipping it because we have a lot of customers wanting to get one,"" he said, referring to the company's first new product since the iPad.

Apple is entering the smartwatch industry a little late, as it did with the iPhone and the iPad in the smartphone and tablet computer industries, but it is looking to define the segment with the Apple Watch. Rival companies have launched smartwatches over the past several months, but the devices have not taken off in the market.

The Apple Watch was unveiled in September last year, with the company revealing that the price of the device would begin at $349. While the basic functions of the device are now known, there are still many questions surrounding the device, such as the cost of high-end models and whether the Apple Watch would have a ""killer app"" that could drastically boost the device's sales.

Apple news website 9to5 Mac acquired information regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the more expensive model that will include gold. The website claims that Apple's official stores will be outfitted with safes such as in jewelry stores to house the devices.


The safes, which will likely be utilized to hold inventory for sale as well as to safeguard demo units, will include the MagSafe chargers for the Apple Watch to keep the held units fully charged.

The news website also claims that Apple has already started the installation of the safes in certain stores ahead of the device's launch date.

Previous reports said that the price of the gold-plated Apple Watch Edition could reach thousands of dollars.

Ben Reitzes, an analyst for Barclays, believes that the launch of the smartwatch seems to be a bit delayed, but Cook's statement that April still qualifies as early 2015 is sufficient.

Cook said that he has been trying out the Apple Watch daily, adding that he ""can't live without it."" The Apple CEO also said that there is an ""impressive"" number of developers working on apps for the Apple Watch."
2500,"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN.

Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo while Rivers was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the same source said Thursday.

The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN -- that staff members at the clinic told investigators Korovin snapped the selfie and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.

Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic.

CNN's source close to the investigaton also provided new details Thursday, including that a sedated Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie.

Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said.

Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said.

The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers.

Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning in the wake of Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore and hoarse throat, the source said.

Cohen detected something of concern, the source said..

Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cut off of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source.

Rivers was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

Korovin was only authorized to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said.

Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated.

Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autograph photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews.

""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year.

Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the reports:

""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.""

The clinic is still open, although an accreditation group is calling for it to suspend procedures and surgeries, according to letters obtained by CNN. Patients were seen in the clinic's waiting room Wednesday.

The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group.

The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled.""

The clinic sent CNN a statement Wednesday night in response to questions about the accreditation association's letter putting the facility under ""emergency suspension.""

""Yorkville Endoscopy continues to maintain its federal, state and Quad A (AAAASF) authorization to be operational and provide patient care. Yorkville Endoscopy is committed to adhering to the standards established by Quad A (AAASF),"" the statement said.

While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of River's personal throat doctor.

Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death

Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released.

The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director.""

The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators.

The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law.

2503,"She apparently hoped tourist attraction would make a lot of money

Serial killer Charles Manson's supposed budding romance with a woman 53 years his junior has been allegedly exposed as a money-making scheme.

According to journalist Daniel Simone, 27-year old Afton Elaine Burton, now known as Star, was hoping that she would gain possession of Manson's corpse through marriage so she and a couple of friends could put it on display in a glass case in LA.

They apparently thought the Lenin's Tomb-esque attraction would draw a huge number of visitors and make a lot of money.

But Manson, 80, apparently got wind of the plan and now no longer wants to marry Burton.

""He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool,"" Simone told The NY Post.

The tourist attraction was also something of a non-starter because Manson believes he is immortal.

""He feels he will never die,"" Simone added. ""Therefore, he feels it’s a stupid idea to begin with.""

Manson and Burton's marriage license expired on Thursday, though Burton apparently remains hopeful that it will be renewed.

Perhaps Manson had the last laugh though - Simone claims he never intended to marry and was stringing Burton and her friends along with the prospect of a wedding as they continued to bring him toiletries and other items."

2507,"Mouthwatering photos of school lunches served around the world reveal even children in Ukraine, Estonia and Greece are treated to delectable meals each day. School children in America, meanwhile, aren't nearly so lucky.

Whereas a kid in France might be treated to a juicy steak and a hunk of brie, the richest country in the world's youths are more likely to receive unidentified meat served alongside little more than a starch like white pasta, fries or a roll.

The contrasts between America's school meals and those in far less fortunate economies are stark and suggest Michelle Obama's push for more healthful lunches nationwide may not be enough.

What is it? School lunches in the United States stand in stark contrast to the wholesome and in some cases even decadent meals served to kids in other markedly less fortunate nations

The first new school lunch standards championed by Michelle Obama have been phased in over the last several school years.

In addition to whole grain requirements, the rules set fat, calorie, sugar and sodium limits on foods in the lunch line and beyond. While many schools have had success putting the rules in place, others have said they are too restrictive and costly.

Backlash against the rules have spawned a wave of social media photos along with the tag #thanksMichelleObama. If these pictures are any indication, schools have responded to the rules by cutting down on portions to reduce fat and calories rather than by using potentially more costly ingredients.

Meanwhile, the widely different meals from Spain, Ukraine, Greece, South Korea, Brazil, France, Finland and Italy are all fresh and wholesome, with fish, steak and vegetables featuring prominently.

Photos of the meals appear on Sweetgreen.com.

But in the UK and US, lunch trays feature processed foods such as popcorn chicken, frankfurters, cookies, and beans from a tin.

What children in other countries eat (clockwise from top left): Ukraine's version of sausage and mash; Brazil's plantains, rice and black beans; beetroot salad and pea soup in Finland and steak with beans and carrots in France (photo courtest Sweetgreen)

South Indian school children eat off a thali plate which has white rice, sambar (dhal), smoked gourd vegetable stir-fry, curd, buttermilk and kesari, a type of sweet dessert made from semolina

The school lunch comparisons were revealed by Sweetgreen, a chain of US restaurants, and website Never Seconds, run by Scottish schoolgirl Martha Payne, who logs her thoughts and experiences of eating school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, Scotland.

The 12-year-old launched the blog in 2012 as a school writing project with assistance from her father, David,

Written under the pseudonym 'VEG' (Veritas Ex Gustu – truth from tasting), with the subtitle 'One primary school pupil's daily dose of school dinners', the blog features daily entries on the $3 school meal that Martha/ 'VEG' has chosen that day, her thoughts on the food and its quality, a count of the number of hairs, a health rating, a picture, and marks out of 10 based on a 'Food-o-Meter'.

Martha, who has been invited to talk in international conferences is currently raising money for Scottish charity Mary's Meals, through her JustGiving page.

Mary's Meals - which began in 2002 as a one-off school feeding programme - currently provides daily life changing meals to over 989,000 hungry children in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and South America.

The surprising pictures show just how the UK and US measures up to the rest of the world when it comes to feeding schoolchildren.

While the majority of lunches feature fresh foods, US tray is packed with processed items.

Similarly the typical UK school lunch is sadly lacking in fresh vegetables, featuring a baked potato, sausage and beans from a tin, and a half corn on the cob with a melon slice to follow.

Lunch in an Estonian school is rice with a piece of meat and purple cabbage. They also have bread and a get a cup of chocolate drink

Balanced diet: Italian children get pasta, fish, two kinds of salad, rocket and caprese, a bread roll and grapes (courtesy Sweetgreen)

In Finland lunch is mainly a vegetarian affair of pea soup, carrots, beetroot salad, crusty roll and sweet pancake with berries to finish

School lunch in Alba, Spain (left): white flesh peaches, strawberries and yogurt melts, cous-cous, broccoli, cucumbers and roasted salmon; (right): Poached apple pears, strawberries and blue berries, boiled swede and fresh garden peas

In France, children start their meal with a generous slab of Brie.

This is followed by a hearty portion of rare steak, served with two types of vegetables - carrots and green beans.

And you won't find sweets on this lunch tray. The healthy theme continues into dessert, with the young ones tucking into kiwi fruit and apples.

The South Korean lunch is equally as impressive.

A milky fish soup to start followed by a serving of stir fried rice with tofu, broccoli and peppers. On the side is kimchi, the traditional Korean condiment of fermented cabbage.

In Scandinavia, Finnish schools dish up a vegetarian lunch of pea soup, beetroot salad, carrots and a roll. For pudding there is pannakkau, a sweet pancake served with strawberries and blueberries.

The Chinese company's efforts to buy out the struggling phone maker were blocked by the Canadian government last year, but the firm could table a new bid as soon as this week, according to Benzinga.

The report states that Lenovo is prepared to make an initial bid of $15 per share, rising to $18 per share once the deal has been completed.

Neither company has commented on the merger, but it was reported earlier this year that a similar deal was blocked by the Canadian authorities due to the BlackBerry infrastructure's ties to national security.

Lenovo's alleged renewed interest in BlackBerry comes after the firm's Passport smartphone proved a hit with investors, despite receiving mixed reviews.

Early this year, Lenovo purchased Motorola Mobility from Google in a big-money deal."

After Chan Chun Chee was caught red handed by the women whose underwear had gone missing, they forced him to wear one of the pilfered bras and made him walk around the block in a classic example of public shaming.

Residents of the block of flats in Singapore first became aware of the kinky thief when items of clothing being left out to dry started going missing, sometimes even from inside their apartments.

Local man Teo Goh, 56, said: ‘We realised he was targeting windows where he knew women lived and knew were open, so we decided to teach him a lesson and publicly humiliate him.’

They sprung a trap by getting one of the women in the block to leave some underwear in plain sight near an open window.

The group then waited for the thief to make his move, before pouncing on him.

After ‘frog marching’ the culprit around the block in his new outfit and forcing him to promise never to steal from them again, the vigilante group called the police to have him arrested.

A police spokesman said: ‘We don’t condone vigilante activity but in this case it seems to have turned out OK.’

Chee now faces three years jail for breaking and entry and theft (plus these embarrassing photos will probably haunt him forever).

2518,"Over the last few months, the U.S. has ratcheted up military efforts against the Islamic militant group ISIS in a big way. Whether engaging in airstrikes to push them out of key points of infrastructure like the Mosul Dam in Iraq, or targeting convoys to try to destabilize the terrorist organization, the fighting has been ongoing. And now, there are reports that the biggest target of all may have been struck: Iraqi defense minister Khaled al-Abadi has claimed that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured by American airstrikes Friday night, the first such reports of an actual brush between al-Baghdadi and U.S. forces.

Not much is known about the background of al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed Caliph of the new Islamic State — he’s believed to be in his early forties, and ascended to the top of ISIS back in 2010, but the vast majority of his personal biography is unclear. What’s transparently clear, however, is the authority he asserts worldwide — ISIS’ vision of a Caliphate, with al-Baghdadi sitting at the top, is one which all Muslims would be forced to recognize if the group had its way.

In short, they’ve cut a fantastically bloody course through Iraq and Syria, killing Muslims, Christians and non-believers alike. They’ve also notably released multiple videos of grisly hostage executions, including those of Americans Steven Sotloff and James Foley.


As always, caution is important. The U.S. hasn’t confirmed these reports just yet, as Colonel Pat Ryder of CENTCOM told Fox News on Sunday, saying ”We have no information to corroborate press reports that ISIL leader al-Baghdadi has been injured.” On Saturday, Ryder did acknowledge that the airstrikes had gone down, however, hitting targets near Mosul.

I can confirm that coalition aircraft did conduct a series of air strikes yesterday evening in Iraq against what was assessed to be a gathering of ISIL leaders near Mosul. We cannot confirm if ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was among those present.

Hopefully the situation will become clearer in the coming days — reports of al-Baghdadi’s injury have been cited by multiple news outlets, including Israeli papers Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, British paper The Guardian, and Time, but until there’s official word on the matter, it’s best not to get too ahead of things. And it’s also important not to assume that al-Baghdadi being injured, or even being killed, means that ISIS will fall apart.

The feeling of futility that sometimes comes with large-scale military battles against far-flung terrorist organizations comes from the ability of these groups to restructure and destabilize themselves, even when a leader dies — as demonstrated by the example of al-Qaeda and leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, for example, who’s been in command long after the death of Osama bin Laden. Basically, whether al-Baghdadi is in charge or not, ISIS will likely remain a worrying and potent force in the region, and one which the U.S. won’t be done engaging with.

2522,"The President of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has adopted a Jewish godson – to prevent him from becoming a werewolf.

Although this sounds like something straight out of a fantasy novel, the President last week met Yair Tawil and his family for the unusual ceremony, which dates back more than 100 years and is based on Argentinian folklore.

According to the legend, the seventh son of a family will transform into ‘El Lobison’, a werewolf like creature, on the first Friday after the boy’s 13th Birthday, and will continue to turn into a blood-thirsty, baby eating werewolf every full moon.

The fear of the creature was so fervent in 19th century Argentina that many families murdered or abandoned their seventh born son, forcing the Argentinian government to implement the process of Presidential adoption.

The tradition was established in 1907, and was extended to baby girls in 1973.

Although having seven children is now much rarer than 100 years ago, seventh sons or daughters can now expect to gain the President as their official godparent, as well as a gold medal and educational scholarship.

The President has said that Yair is the first Jewish boy to take part in the ceremony, as the tradition was exclusive to Catholic children until 2009."
2527,"A female Kurdish fighter, who was viewed as an iconic face of the Kurdish resistance movement, has been reportedly beheaded by ISIS.

The woman, known by the nickname ‘Rehana’ became a face of the conflict after a picture of her holding a rifle and making a V sign was posted on Twitter, receiving over 5,000 retweets.

She fought for the Kurdish Women’s Defense Unit and claimed to have killed 100 ISIS militants.

It is now believed that Rehana may have been killed by IS militants after a picture circulated on Twitter, purporting to show her head being held aloft by a member of the jihadist organisation.

Her death has not been confirmed, however, by the Women’s Defense Unit.

She had been fighting to defend Kobane, a Syrian border town which has been under assault by ISIS for more than a month.

More than 10,000 women have helped to defend the town since the establishment of all female combat units in April.

They now reportedly play a major role in fighting against the IS.

Another female Kurdish fighter, who goes by the pseudonym of Afshin Kobani, said that the advancement of ISIS in Syria had forced to her to join the fight in Kobane.

‘I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,’

‘This is our land – our own – and if we don’t do it, who else will?

‘We are just the same as men; there’s no difference,’ she said. ‘We can do any type of job, including armed mobilisation.’"
2533,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told France’s new president that he was “my guy” in the recent election, a French official said Thursday. The record shows only favorable words from Trump for centrist Emmanuel Macron’s opponent, the defeated far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

A look at Trump’s views, before and now, on this month’s French vote:

TRUMP to Macron at a lunch meeting in Brussels on Thursday, according to a French official: “You were my guy” in the French campaign. Trump also said he didn’t endorse Le Pen, according to the official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and requested anonymity.

THE FACTS: Trump may never have explicitly endorsed any candidate in France’s election, but he had only nice things to say about one candidate: Le Pen. Whatever views he may have expressed privately are unknown.

In an April 21 interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he believed an attack that week on police officers in Paris would help the National Front leader because the violence played to her strengths.

“She’s the strongest on borders, and she’s the strongest on what’s been going on in France,” Trump said in the Oval Office interview. “Whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election.”

By contrast, Trump never spoke publicly about Macron before the vote. Former President Barack Obama endorsed Macron.

While Le Pen had echoed some of Trump’s hardline rhetoric on immigration, the U.S. leader’s words of support were surprising.

Le Pen had distanced herself from her father, National Front party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has been convicted of crimes related to anti-Semitism and mocked the Holocaust as a “detail” of history. But she still drew criticism for denying during the campaign that the French state was responsible for the roundup of Jews during World War II, and maintained an inner circle of old friends from her student days that included members of a radical group known for violence and anti-Semitism.

Trump called Macron after his resounding victory. He also tweeted congratulations to the 39-year-old winner, saying he looked forward to working with him."
2534,"President Donald Trump congratulated newly-elected French president Emmanuel Macron, and in a brief photo-op at the US embassy in Brussels remarked on Macron’s “tremendous victory.”

“It is my great honor to be with the newly elected president of France, who ran an incredible campaign and had a tremendous victory,” Trump said. “All over the world they’re talking about it, and we have a lot to discuss, including terrorism and other things.”

“Congratulations, great job,” he added.

After an intense handshake, Trump also reportedly told Macron he was his preferred candidate in the face-off between the now-president and his far-right opponent Marine Le Pen.
This comes as a surprise, given Trump’s expression of support for Le Pen during the election campaign, which concluded with a Macron victory on May 7.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Trump said he thought Le Pen was the “strongest on borders,” and “the strongest on what’s been going on in France,” though he stopped short of endorsing her.

Le Pen had a similar campaign to Trump’s successful 2016 bid, running on a fiercely anti-immigration platform packaged in populist rhetoric. But as it is well known, Trump is no fan of a loser, which may explain his desire correct the record and confess his long-time support of Macron."
2535,"President Donald Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that he had been a supporter in his race against far-right leader Marine Le Pen, although Trump's only comment on the race had him hailing Le Pen.

Trump told Macron of his views in comments relayed by an official in the French government's office – after a bilateral meeting where the two men engaged in a vigorous handshake that lasted more than five seconds.

'You were my guy,' Trump assured the new French president during their first time meeting in Brussels, the official from the French president's office said, according to French media reports.

Trump told Macron that, contrary to media reports during the race, he had not backed Le Pen and had followed Macron's campaign with great attention, the source said, adding that the two leaders had spoken in English.

MY GUY: President Trump reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron he supported him during the recent elections, despite his comments calling rival Marine Le Pen 'the strongest'

Although Trump didn't endorse Le Pen, he praised her in comments to the Associated Press shortly before the runoff election, following an attack on a French policeman.

'She's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France,' Trump said.

'Whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election,' he added, speaking in late April.

In contrast, former President Obama explicitly endorsed Macron in the race, appearing in an a video for Macron days after the Trump spoke."
2536,"Madonna is pledging to perform oral sex on voters who cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton.

The pop queen, known for her shocking antics, made the remark Tuesday while opening for comedian Amy Schumer in New York.

“If you vote for Hillary Clinton,” Madonna told the crowd at Madison Square Garden, “I will give you a blow job.”
“And I’m good,” the 58-year-old “Like a Virgin” singer, an outspoken supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee, said to cheers from the audience.

“I’m not a tool. I take my time,” Madonna boasted.

Madonna has made a point of rooting on the former secretary of State’s White House bid, posting several pro-Clinton messages on Twitter.

The entertainer’s comments at Schumer’s show come just days after the comic made headlines for telling supporters of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump who booed her to leave a performance. Schumer, who has also endorsed Clinton, reportedly told the crowd, “Just so you know, from now on, if you yell out, you’re gonna get thrown out.”

"
2537,"There’s pretty much nothing Madonna won’t do to make sure Hillary Clinton takes the White House come Election Day.

She’s already taken her top off, publicly associated with Katy Perry, arranged for her son to disembowel a Donald Trump piñata and on Tuesday night, she pledged to perform oral sex on every Clinton supporter at Amy Schumer’s comedy show.


The Queen of Pop tried her hand at stand-up by warming up the crowd at the comedian’s Madison Square Garden show. The “Trainwreck” star previously opened for Madonna in the same venue on her Rebel Heart tour last September, so it’s only fitting that she returned the favor.

Look, we’re not here to tear down Madonna, but when it comes to comedy, Schumer is in ? to put it terms Madge fans will understand ? a league of her own.

“One more thing before I introduce this genius of comedy,” Madonna said to the crowd before Schumer came onstage. “If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a blow job — and I am good.”

“I not a douche. I’m not a tool. I take my time,” she continued, much to the displeasure of any of her children who have internet access. “I have ... eye contact and I do swallow.”"
2538,"Madonna has an offer for Hillary Clinton voters: oral sex.

Madge graced the stage of Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night as the opening act for Amy Schumer’s stand-up show. Before introducing the comedian, she took a moment to endorse Clinton by offering herself to anyone who voted for the Democratic nominee.

“One more thing before I introduce this genius of comedy,” she said before Schumer took the stage. “If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a bl– job. I swear to God — and I am good.”

Madonna joked that she would “take my time” with the act, and further commented on her prowess.

Both Madonna and Schumer have been vocal about this election, as the Queen of Pop recently posted a nude selfie in support of the candidate to show that she’d rather vote naked than not vote at all.

As for Amy Schumer, the comedian recently made headlines when dozens of audience members walked out of her show in Tampa on Sunday night after she slammed Donald Trump. She later addressed the walkout during the gig in New York City. "
2539,"Eggs are the Dr. Jekylll and Mr. Hyde of the breakfast world. One day they’re a diet darling, chockful of healthy fats, vitamin E, and protein. The next thing you hear: Eggs are bad for you—as bad as cigarettes, in fact, according to a recent study in the journal Atherosclerosis.

First, here’s the deal on that new study. Researchers from Western University in Canada  examined over 1,200 men and women to come to the conclusion that regularly eating egg yolks was two-thirds as bad as smoking when it comes to carotid plaque in the arteries, a known risk factor for stroke and heart attack.

But before you ditch the eggs, experts point out that this study doesn’t exactly give the whole picture. The main crack: The research shows an association between egg consumption and plaque buildup, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship, says cardiologist Gordon Tomaselli, MD from the American Heart Association. (In other words, there’s no way to tell which came first, the plaque or the egg.) The study also didn’t control for what else participants ate or take into account how much they exercised, which can play a big role in heart disease, Dr. Tomaselli says.

“While it’s interesting that the graphs of egg yolk consumption and smoking take a similar shape when looking at carotid plaque build-up, this study doesn’t take into account the many other adverse effects of smoking, namely high blood pressure and lung cancer,” says Dr. Tomaselli.

And your rise-and-shine scramble has more to it than just cholesterol: “Eggs contain many other nutrients, including unsaturated fats, which may be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular disease,” says Gregg Fonarow, MD, of UCLA Cardiology. “Whether the net effect of egg consumption is beneficial, neutral, or harmful requires assessing more than just measuring the cholesterol content of egg yolk,” he says.

Here, the bottom line on how to eat eggs healthily:

1. Skip the three-egg omelet. It’s safest to limit your egg consumption to one a day. The American Heart Association recommends that most people limit their daily cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams, and one yolk contains about 185 milligrams. If a single-egg scramble simply won’t cut it, eat extra whites. “This way you’ll get the protein from the whites without the added cholesterol of the yolk,” says Dr. Tomaselli.

2. Hold the bacon. One of the biggest oversights of this study is that it didn’t account for the other foods in a person’s diet—and anyone who’s ever ordered a Grand Slam knows that eggs usually come with side dishes that aren’t exactly good for you, says Marisa Moore, RD, from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Her advice? Pair your egg with fresh fruit, whole grain toast, and veggies instead of fennel sausage, a greasy hash, and bacon.

3. Snack smart. That cookie you’ve got your eye on? Well that has egg in it too. “You have to be cognizant that other dishes contain eggs and cholesterol,” says Dr. Tomaselli. When your next snack attack rolls around, reach for a handful of nuts, which are rich in heart-healthy Vitamin E, monounsaturated fats, and fiber. (Check out 5 more high-protein snacks.)

4. Put ’em out to pasture. It pays to be choosy about which type of eggs you pick up at the supermarket. A 2010 study from Penn State University showed that hens who were kept outside on pastures rather than in a cage laid eggs that had twice as much vitamin E and 2.5 times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids than the eggs from  their cooped-up counterparts. To make sure you’ve got the right ones, look for the word “pastured” on the carton. And as always, organic is best.

2540,"Is your breakfast omelet harming your heart? A recent study by researchers at Western University in Canada found that the more egg yolks people ate, the thicker their artery walls became — an indicator of heart disease risk — and that the effect was almost as bad as from smoking cigarettes.

In the study, the researchers measured carotid plaque build-up in the arteries of 1,231 men and women, average age 62, who were seeking care at cardiovascular-health clinics. Participants filled out questionnaires detailing lifestyle habits including medication use, cigarette smoking and egg-yolk consumption. The researchers gauged how much people smoked and how many egg yolks they ate over time, by calculating their “pack-years” (the number of packs of cigarettes people smoked per day multiplied by the number of years they spent smoking) and “egg-yolk years” (how many egg yolks they ate per week for how many years).

After about age 40, participants’ plaque began building up steadily, but among the participants who ate the most eggs — three or more yolks per week — that build-up increased “exponentially,” the study found. As people’s egg-yolk years went up, so did their plaque accumulation — an association that was independent of factors like gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index and diabetes.

(MORE: Good News, Kids Cholesterol Levels Are Down)

Among the 20% of participants who ate the most eggs, the carotid plaque build-up was about two-thirds that of the study’s heaviest smokers. The researchers concluded that the plaque increase from eating eggs “follows a similar pattern to that of cigarette smoking.”

Arterial accumulation of plaque is a key risk factor for heart attack and stroke. As plaque builds up, it thickens artery walls and narrows the space through which blood can flow, forcing the heart to pump harder. If plaques become unstable, they can break off and form clots, which can halt blood flow to either the brain or the heart, causing stroke or heart attack.

The authors argue that their findings should quell doubts over the link between high dietary cholesterol and heart disease. “The prevailing tendency to ignore dietary cholesterol as a risk factor for coronary heart disease requires reassessment, including the consumption of cholesterol from eggs,” the authors wrote.

The government’s dietary guidelines recommend that adults consume no more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day. One whole egg contains about 180 mg of cholesterol, nearly two-thirds of your daily recommended ma.

“The mantra ‘eggs can be part of a healthy diet for healthy people’ has confused the issue. It has been known for a long time that a high cholesterol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular events, and egg yolks have a very high cholesterol content,” study author Dr. David Spence, a professor of neurology at western’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, said in a statement. “In diabetics, an egg a day increases coronary risk by two- to five-fold.

The study is published in the journal Atherosclerosis."
2541,"PROBLEM: Last year, the average American consumed 247 eggs -- over 40 percent more than the world per-capita average. Because egg yolks are high in cholesterol, eating whole eggs increases cholesterol, a known risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart attacks. Previous research also links CAD with cigarette smoke.

METHODOLOGY: Canadian researchers examined 1,231 patients at London's Health Sciences Centre's University Hospital. The average age of all the patients was 62. Ultrasound measurements of the carotid arteries established the presence and quantity of atherosclerotic plaque, and the scans were accompanied by lifestyle surveys. Smoking was measured in pack-years (number of packs per day multiplied by the number of years spent smoking). Egg yolk consumption was measured in egg yolk-years.

RESULTS: Aging was associated with a linear increase in arterial plaque after age 40, but smoking and egg consumption were each independently associated with an exponential increase in plaque. Egg consumption had two-thirds of the effect of smoking.

CONCLUSION: Egg yolks are almost as bad for your carotid arteries as smoking.

IMPLICATION: While the link between eggs and cholesterol -- and between cholesterol and heart disease -- is well established, this study sheds light on the extent of their potential harm if eaten routinely in large quantities. A single large egg contains more than 180 mg of cholesterol -- more than a third of a person's daily recommended intake. By this measure, a typical American breakfast alone, with two eggs (plus bacon!), would push well past that. Egg whites, meanwhile, remain excellent.

SOURCE: The full study, ""Egg Yolk Consumption and Carotid Plaque,"" is published in the journal Atherosclerosis."
2542,"Remember the ‘70s when doctors equated eggs with cholesterol and heart disease? A recent Canadian study involving over 1,200 adults published in the peer-reviewed journal Atherosclerosis says that eating eggs yolks is about as bad as smoking cigarettes when it comes to advancing coronary heart disease. We’re already seeing cracks in the theory.

In the study, researchers recorded the number of eggs eaten and packs of cigarettes smoked as recalled by each adult (average age 62).  Everyone in the study had been referred to a vascular prevention clinic at a Canadian hospital, meaning their heart health (and the habits that led them there) was already in question. The researchers found that, as expected, plaque build-up in their subjects’ carotid artery thickened with age, and even correlated with smoking and egg-eating habits.


Publications like The Daily Mail and Fox News have reported blindly on the matter, but thankfully there are others out there suspiciously raising eyebrows.

The UK’s National Health Service points out some of the study’s limitations, including:

The accuracy of the participants’ recollections of egg yolk consumption.
A lack of details regarding how the eggs were cooked (or not).
Disregard for other factors of heart disease advancement, including but not limited to exercise, alcohol consumption, antidepressant use (antidepressants have been shown to cause arteries to thicken 400% faster than aging,) and other important dietary factors.
Neither the study in question nor the NHS takes into consideration, however:

The harmful effects of the chemicals and hormones found in non-organic eggs.
The effects on the human body from eating eggs from chicken given GMO feed.
The living condition of the chickens.
Non-organic eggs can contain the same antibiotics, chemicals, and hormones administered to conventional chickens. Add GMO feed, polluted water, and unsanitary living conditions to these chickens, and you may have eggs that are little more than hard-shelled pellets of poison.

Organic eggs from healthy chickens on GMO-free feed have actually shown in many studies to prevent heart disease. They contain healthful amounts of protein, vitamin B, omega-3 fatty acids, and many nutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin, which reduce risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a major cause of blindness.

The key? Moderation, as with most things, and buying organic eggs from local farmers who can raise their chickens in truly cage-free conditions. Happy, healthy chickens produce more healthful eggs."
2543,"Conventional medical authorities say that consumption of saturated animal fats is bad for you and causes heart disease.

But a hundred years ago, fewer than than one in one hundred Americans were obese, and coronary heart disease was unknown.

The Procter and Gamble started marketing Crisco as a new kind of food -- the first commercially marketed trans fat. Crisco was originally used to make candles and soap, but with electrification causing a decline in candle sales,

According to LewRockwell.com:

“Feeding high doses of fat and cholesterol to omnivores, like rats and dogs, does not produce atherosclerotic lesions in them ...

In fact, it turns out that people who have highest percentage of saturated fat in their diets have the lowest risk of heart disease ...

The last word on this subject should go to Julia Child ... Enjoy eating saturated fats, they’re good for you!”





Dr. Mercola's Comments:
The demonization of saturated fat began in 1953, when Dr. Ancel Keys published a paper comparing saturated fat intake and heart disease mortality. His theory turned out to be flimsy, to say the least, but the misguided ousting of saturated fat has continued unabated ever since. Fortunately, the truth is finally starting to come out, as medical scientists have begun to seriously question Keys' findings.

Time to Put Ancel Keys' Theory to Rest
Keys based his theory on a study of six countries, in which higher saturated fat intake equated to higher rates of heart disease. However, he conveniently ignored data from 16 other countries that did not fit his theory. Had he chosen a different set of countries, the data would have shown that increasing the percent of calories from fat reduces the number of deaths from coronary heart disease.

And, as illustrated in the featured article, when you include all 22 countries for which data was available at the time of his study, you find that those who consume the highest percentage of saturated fat have the lowest risk of heart disease.

Furthermore, many have now realized that it's the trans fat found in margarine, vegetable shortening, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that is the true villain, causing far more significant health problems than saturated fat ever could!

Still, despite the scientific evidence, the low-fat dogma remains a favorite among most government health authorities. Case in point: the most recent food chart issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in December of last year, recommends reducing your saturated fat intake to a mere seven percent of caloric intake—down from its previously recommended 10 percent…

Newer Studies Debunk Keys' Theory
The USDA's lowered recommendation is illogical when you consider the evidence available today, which supports saturated fat as a necessary part of a heart healthy diet. For example, as discussed in the featured article, a number of indigenous tribes around the world are living proof that a high-saturated fat diet equates to low mortality from heart disease.

These include:

Tribe Primary Diet Percentage Saturated Fat
Maasai tribe in Kenya/Tanzania Meat, milk, cattle blood 66 percent
Inuit Eskimos in the Arctic Whale meat and blubber 75 percent
Rendille tribe in NE Kenya Camel milk, meat, blood 63 percent
Tokealu, atoll islands in New Zealand territory Fish and coconuts 60 percent
And then there's human breast milk, which contains 54 percent saturated fat. Since breast milk is the most perfect diet in existence for developing infants, the presence of high amounts of saturated fat cannot easily be construed as a ""mistake.""

Furthermore:

A meta-analysis published last year, which pooled data from 21 studies and included nearly 348,000 adults, found no difference in the risks of heart disease and stroke between people with the lowest and highest intakes of saturated fat.
In a 1992 editorial published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. William Castelli, a former director of the Framingham Heart study, stated:

""In Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more calories one ate, the lower the person's serum cholesterol. The opposite of what… Keys et al would predict…We found that the people who ate the most cholesterol, ate the most saturated fat, ate the most calories, weighed the least and were the most physically active.""
Another 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that a reduction in saturated fat intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients, such as carbohydrates.

When you replace saturated fat with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, you exacerbate insulin resistance and obesity, increase triglycerides and small LDL particles, and reduce beneficial HDL cholesterol. The authors state that dietary efforts to improve your cardiovascular disease risk should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intake, and weight reduction.
I believe that last point is very important, and is likely a major key for explaining the rampant increase in obesity, heart disease and diabetes. And once you can pinpoint the problem, turning it all around becomes that much easier.

Carbohydrates, Not Fat, is the Root of Obesity and Heart Disease
Heart disease is so common today, it's hard for people to remember that a mere 100 years ago, this disease was really uncommon.  As Dr. Donald Miller writes in the featured article:

""There were 500 cardiologists practicing in the U.S. in 1950. There are 30,000 of them now – a 60-fold increase for a population that has only doubled since 1950.""

Such an explosion of heart disease indicates that something has changed that is contributing to this epidemic.

What is that ""something""?

Our diet!

Most likely, the studies that have linked the so-called ""Western diet"" to an increased heart disease risk simply confirm that sugar and refined carbohydrates are harmful to your heart health. Because although the Western diet is high in red and processed meats and saturated fats, it's also alarmingly high in sugar and refined carbs like bread and pasta. And, as concluded in the last study listed above, when you reduce saturated fat and increase refined carbohydrates, you end up promoting obesity, heart disease and diabetes...

Gary Taubes has also done an excellent job of explaining the connection between carbs and obesity and its related health issues in his book Why We Get Fat: and what to do about it.

In a nutshell, eating fat and protein does not make you fat—carbohydrates do.I firmly believe the two primary keys for successful weight management and reducing your risk for diabetes, heart disease and other weight-related health problems are:

Severely restricting carbohydrates (sugars, fructose, and grains) in your diet, and
Increasing healthy fat consumption
According to last year's Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the top 10 sources of calories in the American diet are:

Grain-based desserts (cakes, cookies, donuts, pies, crisps, cobblers, and granola bars) 139 calories a day
Alcoholic beverages
Yeast breads, 129 calories a day
Pasta and pasta dishes
Chicken and chicken-mixed dishes, 121 calories a day
Mexican mixed dishes
Soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks, 114 calories a day
Beef and beef-mixed dishes
Pizza, 98 calories a day
Dairy desserts

Looking at this list, it plain to see that CARBS—i.e. sugars (primarily fructose) and grains—are the primary sources of our weight- and health problems, not saturated fats.

(As an update, you've often heard me state that soda is the number one source of calories in the US diet, which it was—based on the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The updated NHANES survey above covers nutritional data from 2005-2006, placing grain-based foods in the top two slots. Still, soda comes in at number four, and I still believe a lot of people, particularly teenagers, probably get a majority of their calories from fructose-rich drinks like soda.)

The Different Types of Fat
Fats can be confusing, but you can generally divide fats into four types:

Saturated fats, from animal fat and tropical oils
Monounsaturated fat, such as olive oil
Polyunsaturated fat, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fats
Trans fats, such as margarine
Sources of healthy fats include:

Olives and Olive oil Coconuts and coconut oil Butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk
Raw Nuts, such as, almonds or pecans Organic pastured egg yolks Avocados
Grass fed meats Palm oil Unheated organic nut oils
Another healthful fat you want to be mindful of is animal-based omega-3. Deficiency in this essential fat can cause or contribute to very serious health problems, both mental and physical, and may be a significant underlying factor of up to 96,000 premature deaths each year. For more information about omega-3's and the best sources of this fat, please review this previous article.

Having the proper balance between omega-3 and omega-6 fats is also very important for optimal health. So in addition to increasing your omega-3 (which most people are sorely deficient in), you also want to decrease your consumption of omega-6, found primarily in:

Corn oil
Soy oil
Canola oil
Safflower oil
Sunflower oil
The ideal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 is 1:1, but the typical American diet is more like 1:20 in favor of omega-6. The overabundance of these oils in processed foods of all kinds explains our excess omega-6 levels.

The other fats you want to avoid are the trans fats. Trans fats are formed when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil during food processing in order to make it solidify. This process, known as hydrogenation, makes fats less likely to spoil, so foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and also have a less greasy feel. The end result of the hydrogenation process is a completely unnatural fat that causes dysfunction and chaos in your body on a cellular level.

Your Body NEEDS Saturated Fat for Optimal Function
Saturated fats from animal and vegetable sources provide a number of important health benefits. In fact, your body cannot function without saturated fats! Saturated fats are needed for the proper function of your:

Cell membranes Heart Bones (to assimilate calcium)
Liver Lungs Hormones
Immune system Satiety (reducing hunger) Genetic regulation
Healthy Fat Tips to Live By
So please remember, you do need a certain amount of healthy fat, while at the same time you'll want to avoid the unhealthy varieties. The easiest way to accomplish this is to simply eliminate processed foods, which are high in all things detrimental to your health: sugar, carbs, and dangerous types of fats.

After that, these tips can help ensure you're eating the right fats for your health:

Use organic butter made from raw grass-fed milk instead of margarines and vegetable oil spreads. Butter is a healthy whole food that has received an unwarranted bad rap.
Use coconut oil for cooking. It is far superior to any other cooking oil and is loaded with health benefits. (Remember that olive oil should be used COLD, drizzled over salad or fish, for example, not to cook with.)
Following my nutrition plan will automatically reduce your modified fat intake, as it will teach you to focus on healthy whole foods instead of processed junk food.
To round out your healthy fat intake, be sure to eat raw fats, such as those from avocados, raw dairy products, and olive oil, and also take a high-quality source of animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil."
2544,"We’ve been told that saturated fat is unhealthy.

It is claimed to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks.

However… many recent studies suggest that the true picture is more complicated than that.

This article takes a detailed look at saturated fat and whether it is good or bad for your health.

What is Saturated Fat?

“Fats” are macronutrients.

That is, nutrients that we consume in large amounts and give us energy.

Each fat molecule is made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids… which can be either saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated.

What this “saturation” stuff has to do with, is the number of double bonds in the molecule.

Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond and polyunsaturated fatty acids have two or more double bonds.

This picture here shows the difference:

Saturated vs Unsaturated Fatty AcidsPhoto Source.

Another way to phrase this, is that saturated fatty acids have all their carbon (C) atoms fully “saturated” with hydrogen (H) atoms.

Foods that are high in saturated fat include fatty meats, lard, full-fat dairy products like butter and cream, coconuts, coconut oil, palm oil and dark chocolate.

Actually, “fats” contain a combination of different fatty acids. No fat is pure saturated fat, or pure mono- or polyunsaturated.

Even foods like beef also contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fats (1).

Fats that are mostly saturated (like butter) tend to be solid at room temperature, while fats that are mostly unsaturated (like olive oil) are liquid at room temperature.

Like other fats, saturated fat contains 9 calories per gram.

Bottom Line: Saturated “fats” are fats that contain a high proportion of saturated fatty acids, which contain no double bonds. Saturated fats are solid at room temperature.
Why do People Think That it is Harmful?

A Single Butter Curl

Back in the 20th century, there was a major epidemic of heart disease running rampant in America.

It used to be a rare disease, but very quickly it skyrocketed and became the number one cause of death… which it still is (2).

Researchers learned that eating saturated fat seemed to increase levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream.

This was an important finding at the time, because they also knew that having high cholesterol was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.

This led to the following assumption being made:

If saturated fat raises cholesterol (A causes B) and cholesterol causes heart disease (B causes C), then this must mean that saturated fat causes heart disease (A causes C).

However, at the time, this was not based on any experimental evidence in humans.

This hypothesis (called the “diet-heart hypothesis”) was based on assumptions, observational data and animal studies (3).

The diet-heart hypothesis then turned into public policy in 1977, before it was ever proven to be true (4).

Even though we now have plenty of experimental data in humans showing these initial assumptions to be wrong, people are still being told to avoid saturated fat in order to reduce heart disease risk.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats have been assumed to cause heart disease by raising cholesterol in the blood. However, no experimental evidence has ever directly linked saturated fat to heart disease.
Saturated Fat Can Raise LDL (The “Bad”) Cholesterol, But Also HDL (The “Good”) Cholesterol

It’s important to realize that the word “cholesterol” is often used inaccurately.

Older Male Doctor

HDL and LDL, the “good” and “bad” cholesterols, aren’t actually cholesterol… they are proteins that carry cholesterol around, known as lipoproteins.

LDL stands for Low Density Lipoprotein and HDL stands for High Density Lipoprotein. All “cholesterol” is identical.

At first, scientists only measured “Total” cholesterol, which includes cholesterol within both LDL and HDL. Later they learned that while LDL was linked to increased risk, HDL was linked to reduced risk (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

“Total” cholesterol is actually a highly flawed marker because it also includes HDL. So having a high HDL (protective) actually contributes to a high “Total” cholesterol.

Because saturated fat raised LDL levels, it seemed logical to assume that this would increase the risk of heart disease. But scientists mostly ignored the fact that saturated fat also raises HDL.

All that being said, new research has shown that LDL isn’t necessarily “bad” because there are different subtypes of LDL (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16):

Small, dense LDL: These are small lipoproteins that can penetrate the arterial wall easily, which drives heart disease.
Large LDL: These lipoproteins are large and fluffy and don’t easily penetrate the arteries.
The small, dense particles are also much more susceptible to becoming oxidized, which is a crucial step in the heart disease process (17, 18, 19).

People with mostly small LDL particles have three times greater risk of heart disease, compared to those with mostly large LDL particles (20).

So… if we want to reduce our risk of heart disease, we want to have mostly large LDL particles and as little of the small ones as possible.

Here’s an interesting bit of information that is often ignored by “mainstream” nutritionists… eating saturated fat changes the LDL particles from small, dense to Large (21, 22, 23).

What this implies is that even though saturated fat can mildly raise LDL, they are changing the LDL to a benign subtype that is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.

Even the effects of saturated fat on LDL aren’t as dramatic as you may think. Although they increase LDL in the short-term, plenty of long-term observational studies find no link between saturated fat consumption and LDL levels (24, 25, 26).

It also seems to depend on the “chain length” of the fatty acid. For example, palmitic acid (16 carbons) may raise LDL, while stearic acid (18 carbons) does not (27).

Now scientists have realized that it’s not just about the LDL concentration or the size of the particles, but the number of LDL particles (called LDL-p) floating in the bloodstream.

Low-carb diets, which tend to be high in saturated fat, can lower LDL-p, while low-fat diets can have an adverse effect and raise LDL-p (28, 29, 30, 31).

Bottom Line: Saturated fats raise HDL (the “good”) cholesterol and change LDL from small, dense (bad) to Large LDL, which is mostly benign. Overall, saturated fats do not harm the blood lipid profile like previously believed.
Does Saturated Fat Cause Heart Disease?

Old Man Taking Pills

The supposedly harmful effects of saturated fat are the cornerstone of modern dietary guidelines.

Because of that, this topic has received enormous amounts of funding.

However… despite decades of research and billions of dollars spent, scientists still haven’t been able to demonstrate a clear link.

Several recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies, found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease.

This includes a review of 21 studies with a total of 347,747 participants, published in 2010. Their conclusion: there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease (32).

Another review published in 2014 looked at data from 76 studies (both observational studies and controlled trials) with a total of 643,226 participants. They found no link between saturated fat and heart disease (33).

We also have a systematic review from the Cochrane collaboration, which combines data from numerous randomized controlled trials.

According to their review, published in 2011, reducing saturated fat has no effect on death or death from heart disease (34).

However, they found that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events (but not death) by 14%.

This does not imply that saturated fats are “bad,” just that certain types of unsaturated fats (mostly Omega-3s) are protective, while saturated fats are neutral.

So… the biggest and best studies on saturated fat and heart disease show that there is no direct link. It was a myth all along.

Unfortunately, the governments and “mainstream” health organizations seem reluctant to change their minds and continue to promote the old low-fat dogma.

For more, read this review of 5 recent studies on saturated fat and health.

Bottom Line: The link between saturated fat and heart disease has been studied intensely for decades, but the biggest and best studies show that there is no statistically significant association.
Does a Diet Low in Saturated Fat Have Any Health Benefits, or Help You Live Longer?

Frustrated Young Woman With Vegetables on a Plate

Several massive studies have been conducted on the low-fat diet.

This is the diet recommended by the USDA and mainstream health organizations all over the world.

The main purpose of this diet, is to reduce the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.

This diet also recommends increased consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains… along with reduced consumption of sugar.

The Women’s Health Initiative was the biggest nutrition study in history. It was a randomized controlled trial with 46,835 women, who were instructed to eat a low-fat diet.

After 7.5-8 years, there was only 0.4 kg (1 pound) difference in weight and there was zero difference in heart disease, cancer or death (35, 36, 37, 38).

Other massive studies have confirmed this… the low-fat diet provides no benefit for heart disease or the risk of death (39, 40).

Several studies that replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oils showed that more people in the vegetable oil groups ended up dying (41, 42).

It is interesting to see that since the low-fat guidelines came out, the prevalence of obesity has skyrocketed (43):

Low Fat Guidelines and Obesity Epidemic

This graph shows that the obesity epidemic started full-force at the same time the low-fat advice was peaking. The type 2 diabetes epidemic followed soon after.

Of course, this graph alone doesn’t prove anything (correlation does not equal causation), but it does make sense that replacing traditional foods like butter and meat with processed low-fat foods high in sugar had something to do with it.

It’s also interesting when looking at the literature, that in almost every single study comparing the “expert approved” low-fat diet to other diets (including paleo, vegan, low-carb and Mediterranean), it loses (44, 45, 46, 47).

Bottom Line: Studies on the low-fat diet do not show a reduced risk of heart disease or death and some studies show that replacing saturated fat with vegetable oils increases the risk.
People With Certain Medical Conditions May Want to Minimize Saturated Fat

Suspicious Doctor

The results of most studies are based on averages.

The studies clearly show that, on average, saturated fat does not raise the risk of heart disease.

However, within those averages, there is room for individual variability.

Perhaps most individuals see no effect… while others experience decreased risk and yet others experience an increased risk.

That being said, there are definitely some people who may want to minimize saturated fat in the diet.

This includes individuals with a genetic disorder called Familial Hypercholesterolemia, as well as people who have a gene variant called ApoE4 (48).

With time, the science of genetics will most surely discover more ways in which diet affects our individual risk for disease.

Bottom Line: Some people may want to minimize saturated fat intake, including people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia or a gene called ApoE4.
Saturated Fat is Excellent for Cooking and Foods That Are High in it Tend to be Healthy and Nutritious

Saturated fat has some important beneficial aspects that are rarely mentioned.

Chef Holding Bell Pepper and Meat

For example, saturated fats are excellent for cooking. Because they have no double bonds, they are highly resistant to heat-induced damage (49).

Polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, easily oxidize when they’re heated (50).

For this reason, coconut oil, lard and butter are all excellent choices for cooking, especially for high-heat cooking methods like frying.

Foods that are naturally high in saturated fat also tend to be healthy and nutritious, as long as you’re eating quality unprocessed foods.

These include naturally fed/raised meats, dairy products from grass-fed cows, dark chocolate and coconuts.

Bottom Line: Saturated fats are excellent cooking fats and foods that are high in saturated fat tend to be both healthy and nutritious.
The “Bad” Fats You Should Avoid Like The Plague

Bottles of Vegetable Oil

There are many different types of fat.

Some of them are good for us, others neutral, yet others are clearly harmful.

The evidence points to saturated and monounsaturated fats being perfectly safe and maybe even downright healthy.

However… the situation is a bit more complicated with polyunsaturated fats.

When it comes to those, we have both Omega-3s and Omega-6s.

We need to get these two types of fatty acids in a certain balance, but most people are eating way too many Omega-6 fatty acids these days (51).

It is a good idea to eat plenty of Omega-3s (such as from fatty fish), but most people would do best by reducing their Omega-6 consumption (52).

The best way to do that is to avoid seed- and vegetable oils like soybean and corn oils, as well as the processed foods that contain them.

Another class of fats, artificial trans fats, is also very harmful.

Trans fats are made by exposing polyunsaturated vegetable oils to a chemical process that involves high heat, hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst.

Studies show that trans fats lead to insulin resistance, inflammation, belly fat accumulation and drastically raise the risk of heart disease (53, 54, 55, 56).

So eat your saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and Omega-3s… but avoid trans fats and processed vegetable oils like the plague.

Bottom Line: The truly harmful fats are artificial trans fats and processed vegetable oils high in Omega-6 fatty acids.
Blaming New Health Problems on Old Foods Doesn’t Make Sense

The health authorities have spent an immense amount of resources studying the link between saturated fat and heart disease.

Despite thousands of scientists, decades of work and billions of dollars spent, this hypothesis still hasn’t been supported by any good evidence.

The saturated fat myth wasn’t proven in the past, isn’t proven today and never will be proven… because it’s just flat out wrong.

Not only is this myth NOT supported by scientific evidence, it is easily refuted with some plain common sense…

Humans and pre-humans have been eating saturated fat for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, but the heart disease epidemic started a hundred years ago.

Blaming new health problems on old foods just doesn’t make sense."
2545," Saturated fats have long been called ''bad fats'' for their effect on the heart. But a new analysis calls into question whether they're really that bad after all.

The findings, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, have sparked renewed debate about fats and heart health.

The new study should trigger a review of current diet guidelines for heart health, according to the researchers who did the analysis. Other experts, including one from the American Heart Association, disagree.

There is some common ground. All agree that dietary fat is just one factor that drives heart disease risk. Paying attention to the other factors is also important.

WebMD asked a study co-author, a cardiologist, a nutrition expert, and the American Heart Association to elaborate.

What did the analysis look at and find?

Researchers looked at 72 published studies on fats and heart disease. The studies involved more than 600,000 people from 18 countries. Some people already had heart disease, while others did not. The researchers reanalyzed the results, an approach called a meta-analysis.

They looked at whether different fats helped or hurt your heart. The different fats included:

Saturated fats (found in meats, whole-fat dairy products, and baked goods)
Polyunsaturated fats, such as omega-3 and omega-6 (found in fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils)
Monounsaturated fats (found in olive and canola oils)
Trans fats (found in fried foods and baked goods, and being phased out of the food supply)
The surprise? Saturated fats, long thought to raise heart disease risks, had no effect. Neither did monounsaturated fats, which are thought to help the heart, says study researcher Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, at the Harvard School of Public Health.

Which fats did have an effect? Trans fats, known to raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol, were linked with a higher risk of heart disease, as expected. Omega-3s from food helped. Omega-6s appeared to help.

What do the researchers say about the findings?

Nutritional guidelines on fats and heart health by such organizations as the American Heart Association may deserve another look, the study authors say.

The focus should move beyond just the fat content of food, Mozaffarian says. ""We can't judge the healthfulness of a food [only] by how many grams of saturated fat it has. We really should be moving toward a food-based analysis.

""It's not just the fat grams, and the type of food, but the way the food is processed,"" he says. For instance, the analysis found that a type of saturated fat linked with milk and dairy products reduced heart disease risk.

Based on the analysis, Mozaffarian and his colleagues say, the current heart health guidelines that promote eating more foods with omega-3s and omega-6s and less of those with saturated fats are not needed.

What do others say?

Other experts find fault with the study and its conclusions.

""Mainly I think the findings should be disregarded,"" says Walter Willett, MD, chair of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. While the analysis suggests that ''saturated fat is not quite as bad as its reputation, it depends on what you compare it to,"" he says.

""If you replace saturated fat with carbohydrates or refined starch or sugar, you are not changing your heart disease risk,"" he says. ''If you replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, you do get a reduction in heart disease risk.""

One analysis is not enough to change dietary advice, says James Blankenship, MD, director of cardiology at Geisinger Medical Center.

In the analysis, the researchers themselves cite a number of caveats and limitations, such as study participants self-reporting their fat intake.

In response to the study, the American Heart Association says its guidelines remain the same. For heart health, it recommends a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, nuts, and unsaturated fats.

Less than 6% of the diet should include saturated and trans fats, the association says.

Is there some common ground about how to protect heart health?

Yes.

Judging how heart-healthy a food is must take more than fat into account, Mozaffarian says. For instance, a lower-fat meat that is processed is not heart-healthy, he says.

Willett agrees. ""It's important to look at single nutrients, but also at whole food groups,"" he says. Blankenship offers these steps proven to benefit the heart:

Get regular exercise -- at least a half-hour a day.
Maintain a healthy body weight.
See your doctor and find out your heart disease risk. Know your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
""Don't spend so much time looking at food labels,"" Blankenship says. Instead, he says, go to the grocery store's produce department and load up.

If cholesterol and saturated fat don't play as large a role as we thought in heart disease, what's behind the heart disease problem?

Multiple factors, Blankenship says. They include obesity, genetics, sedentary lifestyles, diabetes, and high blood pressure. A poor diet drives risk, he says, ""but it's not the only thing.""

Mozaffarian reports receiving fees from Bunge, Pollock Institute, Quaker Oats, Life Sciences Research Organization, Foodminds, Nutrition Impact, Amarin, Astra Zeneca, Winston and Strawn LLP, and UpToDate, and serving on the scientific advisory board for Unilever North America.

The study was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council, Cambridge National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, and Gates Cambridge."
2546,"Poor old saturated fat. For over forty years now, it’s been spoken of only in hushed tones, dissed as nothing but artery clogging, obesity-causing poison. This “common sense fact” has become so widely accepted that a lot of people who want to improve their diet start by purchasing skim milk, ditching their egg yolks, and beginning a life free of steak, pork, and butter.

It’s time to bring bacon back to breakfast. After all, saturated fat is good for you.

We’ve Made a Huge Mistake

But we all make mistakes. This one started in 1970, with the first publication of “The Seven Countries Study .” The research looked at the incidences of saturated fat intake and heart disease among 12,763 men from (you guessed it) seven different countries, and showed a correlation between the two.

Unfortunately, the study was deeply flawed: It didn’t take into account important factors like smoking rates, sugar consumption, and exercise levels, and it left out an awful lot of data from other countries that contradicted the conclusions. The study’s authors actually had access to twenty-two countries’ data, and didn’t discuss any of the populations that followed diets with plenty of saturated fat and barely experienced any heart disease. Such communities include the Kenyan Masai, the Tokelau in Polynesia, and the Arctic Inuit.

Governments followed by making the supposed saturated fat-heart disease connection a matter of public health policy, an ideology which probably culminated with the abominable food pyramid of the 1990s — which recommended up to 11 servings of rice and pasta per day, and about as little fat as possible.

The result? In the past 30 years in the United States, the amount of calories from consumed fat has fallen from 40 percent to 30 percent, while obesity has doubled and heart disease has remained the country’s number one killer.

But the spread of obesity has no single cause; there are a lot of complicated factors that have led to America’s health crisis. To figure out whether saturated fat should be added back into our diets, let’s take a closer look at its effect on the body.

Why Saturated Fat Doesn't Cause Heart Disease

In a 2010 evaluation of 21 studies and 350,000 subjects, saturated fat was not associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease — and numerous other studies have reached similar conclusions        . Of course, these studies aren’t without controversy. For instance, Greatist expert and physician Dr. James Hardeman believes those 21 studies aren’t comprehensive enough; on average, their subjects were studied for around 14 years, which may not be long enough to see the effects of a diet high in saturated fat. However, they raise important questions about saturated fat’s effects on the arteries of the heart and brain.


PIN IT
But what about cholesterol? We actually have two kinds of cholesterol in our blood: the HDL (“good”) and LDL (“bad”). Total cholesterol levels are less important than the ratio of HDL to LDL, but a simpler (if kind of flawed) approach is that we should try to increase HDL and decrease LDL. Saturated fat is generally believed to increase the bad cholesterol.

But that’s only part of the story, because there are also two kinds of LDL cholesterol: big, floaty particles (type A) and small, dense ones (type B). When someone reduces their consumption of saturated fat and their LDL cholesterol “drops,” they’re only lowering their type A particles. But it’s the type B particles that are more closely linked in heart disease, and they’re generally controlled by carbohydrate consumption . So the best way to cut out harmful types of cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease could be to follow a diet that’s low in carbs, rather than fat        .

Why Saturated Fat Can Be Good For You

Saturated fat has been shown to have loads of positive effects on the body, including:

Liver Health: Saturated fat encourages the liver cells to dump their fat cells, which helps the liver to function more effectively  .
Immunity: Saturated fatty acids, especially the kinds found in butter and coconut, help white blood cells to recognize and destroy invading viruses and bacteria. Go get ‘em, boys!
Hormones: Eating saturated fat tends to increase free testosterone levels, which helps to repair tissue, preserve muscle, and improve sexual function  .
Now, fat is high in calories, so it can promote weight gain in that respect. Per gram, it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbohydrates. But provided an eye is kept on portion size, saturated fat in and of itself doesn’t have any negative impact on the body. In fact, increasing fat intake might help with weight loss: One study found that when three groups of obese people were fed diets of 90 percent fat, 90 percent protein, and 90 percent carbohydrates, respectively, the high-fat group lost the most weight . Plus, it tastes freaking delicious.

DROP THAT HOT DOG!

This doesn’t mean every source of saturated fat is healthy. Case in point: A study from the Harvard School of Public Health found that after analyzing the diets of 1.2 million people, there was no association between eating red meat and heart disease — but there was for those who ate a lot of processed meat . That is to say, if we’re going to get sick from eating meat or saturated fat, it’ll be by getting it from a crappy source.

Basically, we should spend a little more on food. The body loves saturated fat, but from sources like grass-fed meat and butter, whole eggs, and coconut fat — not hot dogs and pepperoni pizza (sorry). By a mile, the biggest enemy in our food is likely refined sugar . Even the American Heart Association, which is still anti-saturated fat, agrees that sugar is a far bigger contributor to heart disease.

But the tide is very slowly starting to turn. Prominent journals and scientists are beginning to speak out on saturated fat’s benefits, and, after government scientists reviewed 16,000 studies on diet and obesity, Sweden recently became the first Western country to advocate a high-fat diet to its citizens.

That’s because heart disease and obesity are caused by inactivity, trans fats, refined carbs, and overeating, to name a few — but not saturated fat. Toss the margarine and tuck into some buttered vegetables or a seared steak. We think you deserve it."
2547,"Saturated fat has been a controversial subject in recent years, with some research suggesting that it may not be as bad for health as once thought. But a new study published in The BMJ dashes any hope that butter is actually back.

Cutting down on saturated fatty acids—found in animal foods, like dairy and meat, as well as palm and coconut oil—may lower risk of coronary heart disease, according to researchers. And swapping these foods for unsaturated fats (from vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, avocados, and seafood, for example), whole grains, and plant-based proteins (think lentils and edamame) seems to boost heart health even further.

The new findings are significant because saturated fat has been a source of debate: Studies have shown that saturated fatty acids can affect cholesterol, but there's hasn't been any definitive research linking them to overall heart health. A large meta-analysis published this summer, for example, found that butter consumption does not appear to raise heart disease risk.

The current U.S. Dietary Guidelines have taken a conservative approach to saturated fats, saying they should make up no more than 10% of total calories. Qi Sun, MD, assistant professor of nutrition in the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and senior author of the new study, says his group’s findings back up this advice.

RELATED: 13 Healthy High-Fat Foods You Should Eat

The new study also bolsters government recommendations for “eating an overall healthful diet,"" Dr. Sun told Health—one that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, vegetable cooking oils rich in polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats (the two main types of unsaturated fats), nuts, legumes, fish, and low-fat dairy.

To determine saturated fat’s long-term effects on heart health, he and his colleagues followed more than 73,000 women and 42,000 men for an average of 26 years, collecting data on their diet and health every four years.

After controlling for factors such as age, ethnicity, and other potential influencers, the researchers found that participants who consumed the most calories from four commonly consumed saturated fatty acids—lauric acid, myristic acid, plametic acid, and stearic acid—were 18% more likely to develop coronary heart disease over the course of the study than those who consumed the least.

Some researchers have suggested putting individual limits on each of these fatty acids, said co-author Frank Hu, PhD, professor of nutrition and epidemiology, in a press release. But that’s not practical, he argues, since they share many of the same food sources: red meat, dairy fat, butter, lard, and palm oil.

RELATED: Good Fats, Bat Fats: How to Choose

Instead, it is healthier to focus on lowering total saturated fat intake, says Hu. In fact, the researchers estimated that replacing just 1% of those fats with the same number of calories from poly- or monounsaturated fats (think avocado and nuts), whole grains, or plant-based proteins could reduce heart disease risk by 4% to 8%.

The study specifically recommends swapping animal fats (butter and lard) with vegetable oils high in unsaturated fat; and points out that restaurant food, and snacks and bakery items—including crackers, chips, popcorn, cakes, and cookies—can be high in saturated fat.

The researchers also offer some insight as to why prior studies haven't always shown a clear link between less saturated fat intake and better heart health. Often, the authors say, people who cut back on saturated fat replace those calories with low-quality carbs, like processed food and refined flour. These are associated with health risks of their own, and likely cancel out any health benefits.

RELATED: The 22 Worst Foods for Trans Fat

This is the largest observational study to-date to examine the association between specific saturated fatty acids and the risk of coronary heart disease, say the authors, and its results are in line with previous research that has focused specifically on healthy swaps.

While the findings aren’t terribly surprising, they do serve one important purpose: As Hu put it, “this study dispels the notion that ‘butter is back.'"""
2548,"A workout so intense that it worries some professionals is set to become the fitness trend of 2014. High intensity training (HIT) used to be the preserve of the most dedicated fitness fanatics but is heading into the mainstream, with one of the UK's largest gym companies capitalising on its popularity.

Fitness First is launching Tabata classes containing a four-minute form of HIT in 50 of its London gyms this month before rolling out the classes nationwide to its 180,000 members in the new year.

The chain claims the Tabata method has been ""scientifically proven to be the most effective way to increase both aerobic and anaerobic fitness"". Its website cites tests using the system which it says increased VO2 max – the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise – by 13% in six weeks. It says a trial using 30-second ""bursts of intensity"" with two-minute rest periods was not as effective.

Japanese scientist Professor Izumi Tabata gave his name to the method while working with his country's Olympic speed-skating team. His routine consisted of a combination of 20 seconds of intense exercise, followed by 10 seconds of rest to a rotation lasting four minutes.

Fitness First's website states: ""Professor Tabata's latest research shows that if [his regime] is followed correctly, the body will continue to consume more calories for up to 12 hours after the exercise class. These are additional calories to those consumed by the body at rest – so over and above the so-called RMB or Resting Metabolic Rate.""

The dangers of HIT training, especially for people who are middle-aged, was highlighted this year when Andrew Marr said that the stroke which almost killed him occurred in the middle of an intense workout on his rowing machine at home.

Fitness First's online promotion does include an advisory note for anyone considering the Tabata class to consult a doctor before beginning the routines, especially if they have existing medical conditions. A spokesman said the 10-minute warm-up followed by a four-minute Tabata rotation ""will reap the same benefits as an hour on an exercise bike cycling at moderate rate"".

Cardiologist and fitness enthusiast Dr Aseem Malhotra questioned if HIT is the best form of exercise. ""Although I don't object in principle to high intensity training, there is no long-term data into its benefits. People exercise for all different reasons,"" he said. ""Some like to push their body to the limits, others do it competitively, but for the majority it's for improving overall health. No one can doubt the multitude of benefits of regular exercise, and as a regular gym enthusiast myself I know of the benefits as much as anyone. But, like anything, too much exercise can be a bad thing, with good data revealing that the greatest cardiovascular benefit for running was up to 20 miles a week at a moderate pace. If you ran more than this at a faster pace the benefits started to get lost.""

A study of up to 10,000 former Olympic athletes published in the British Medical Journal revealed that in disciplines with high-intensity activity, such as cycling, boxing and rowing, competitors did not live longer than those at low-intensity sports such as cricket and golf. ""In fact, those athletes who engaged in high intensity physical contact sports had a higher mortality than those in the lowest intensity,"" said Malhotra. ""For the majority of the population, improving longevity and general health can be done by brisk walking for 20 minutes three times a week – and doesn't involve spending money joining a gym.""

HIT's surge in popularity was highlighted by a recent survey of almost 30,000 people for the American College of Sports Medicine, which showed that, although once the workout of choice for twenty and thirtysomethings, older people and non-fitness enthusiasts planned to attempt the regime in 2014. Last year HIT did not appear in the top 20 of the ACSM's annual list predicting fitness trends, but this year it is number one.Professor Walt Thompson from the University of Georgia and lead author of the ACSM report said: ""We've never seen something introduced to the market and catch on so fast."""
2549,"It is hailed as the best way to get fit, with celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Katie Holmes purporting to be fans.

High intensity training - or HIIT as it is known -  is a form of strength training that involves the repetition of short bursts of activity or weight training.

But, if a person isn’t accustomed to this form of exercise, the workouts could be doing more harm than good, experts have warned.

They revealed exhausting high intensity training can increase a person’s risk of heart disease and cancer.

These work-outs also weaken the body’s ability to fight off free radicals – which are the harmful chemicals that alter DNA and can lead to a host of illnesses.

Scientists revealed exhausting high-intensity short-burst training does more harm than good when attempted by people who are new to going to the gym +2
Scientists revealed exhausting high-intensity short-burst training does more harm than good when attempted by people who are new to going to the gym

Study author Dr Robert Boushel, of the University of British Columbia, in Canada, said: ‘If you’re new to going to the gym, participating in high-intensity “sprint” classes may increase your performance but might not be healthy for you.’

High intensity workouts are said to be able to burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour."
2550,"Vanilla exercise is passé. Fitness fan-atics are putting some Shades of Grey into their workouts, opting for short, sharp, punishing regimes that promise to get you twice as fit in half the time of a regular gym session. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) sessions can last for just 20 minutes. Spend 30 seconds pushing your body and metabolism out of its comfort zone by working out as hard as you can — say, by sprinting — then recover with lighter exercise, such as jogging, for 20 seconds before powering up again. And again and again.

Studies have shown that within months, even weeks, the body’s systems can adapt positively to the increases in stress and as a result fitness improves enormously. Research suggests that these regimes can help to reduce blood sugar levels and offset Type 2 diabetes, as well as improving strength, endurance and muscle tone. So no more excuses for those previously claiming to be ‘too busy’ to work out.

And yet, despite the evidence, controversy is now clouding this intense exercise phenomenon. With the BBC presenter Andrew Marr’s revelation that he believes his recent stroke was linked to intense interval training on a rowing machine, there is a fear that HIIT can cause more harm than good, because what all variations of these workouts share (some focus on strength, others on cardio) is that they are punishing to the extreme. So you have to be reasonably fit to begin with in order to try them safely. This, say experts, is where some people are going wrong. ‘These types of sessions are not suitable for everyone,’ says Greg Whyte, professor of applied sport and exercise science at Liverpool John Moores University. ‘You need to have a good fitness background before you even take part. Pushing yourself to those limits is strongly inadvisable if you are in any way unfit or have underlying problems.’

People mistakenly think that because they last for just a few minutes, these workouts are an easy option. Don’t be fooled. Steve Barrett, a personal trainer who has worked with leading athletes, says, ‘They should leave you feeling as if you literally couldn’t do anything more.’ And that degree of effort, says Dr Dominic Micklewright, director of the sport, performance and fatigue research unit at the University of Essex, can mean ‘there is almost certainly an increased risk of injury among untrained people with this sort of approach’. Couple intense workouts with minimal calorie intake or fasting and you could find yourself suffering more for your fitness than you imagined; with blood sugar levels too low to sustain you through these workouts, headaches, muscle weakness and nausea or feeling faint could result.

None of this means that, as long as you are fit enough, the high-intensity approach should be avoided. Barrett uses it with some of his fitter clients and says it should be employed two to four times a week, in addition to run-of-the-mill activities such as steady running, cycling or swimming. And most experts agree that, if you build up to it, interval training of some sort is essential for fitness progression, but that a watered-down version of HIIT is more appropriate for the masses. Exercise scientists at McMaster University in Canada recently tried a ‘gentler’ version of a HIIT schedule, involving a minute of effort followed by a minute of easy recovery repeated ten times over 20 minutes, on a group including some previously unfit volunteers. All displayed remarkable improvements in overall health and fitness after several weeks. ‘With any exercise, the key thing is to feel like you’ve worked hard, but not to the point that you are in extreme physical discomfort or pain,’ says Barrett. ‘You do need to push yourself harder in order to progress, but it should be effort that is just within the realms of your ability. Always listen to your body.’"
2551,"Many people with chronic health problems resign themselves to lives of modest activity or no activity at all, thinking vigorous exercise is unsafe or that they lack the stamina for it. But recent studies are proving just the opposite.

They are showing that high-intensity exercise may be even better than regular aerobic activities for many patients with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, pulmonary disease, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease.

The studies strongly suggest that a more demanding but more efficient and often more enjoyable form of exercise known as high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, is not only safe for most patients but more effective at preventing or reversing the deficits associated with many chronic ailments.

Although once reserved for athletes seeking a competitive advantage and for healthy people wanting to burn more body fat, HIIT is now being studied as a treatment that is sometimes as effective as medication for many people with chronic health problems.

Researchers have found that repeatedly pushing the body close to its exercise limits for very brief periods, interspersed with periods of rest, is more effective than continuous moderate activity at improving cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and mechanical functions.

Instead of continuous movement for 20 or more minutes, as is typical for exercise walkers, joggers and cyclists, HIIT usually involves 30 to 60 seconds of exercise near the peak of a person’s ability, followed by a comparable recovery period of easy activity, with the sequence repeated for a total of about 20 minutes three times a week.

“We know that exercise is good for people at risk of chronic disease, but people tend not to exercise,” said Jonathan P. Little, a specialist in exercise physiology at the University of British Columbia at Okanagan. Yet he and other researchers report that study participants find interval training more enjoyable than continuous aerobic exercise, making it more likely that people will continue it on their own.

Various activities can be adapted to interval training, including cycling, swimming, walking and jogging, especially on a machine like a stationary bike or treadmill. But HIIT is possible indoors and out, for example by alternating sprints with more moderate exercise.

The intensity is tailored to an individual’s starting ability. “The high-intensity component is set at 80 to 90 percent of the person’s maximum aerobic capacity,” Dr. Little said. Researchers commonly use exercise bikes and treadmills to adjust the pace mechanically.

However, high-intensity exercise, even just half a minute at a time, is not appropriate for everyone. In a recent report in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal, Dr. Little; his wife, Mary E. Jung, also at the University of British Columbia; and Marcus W. Kilpatrick of the University of South Florida wrote that HIIT “is only appropriate for low-risk individuals, moderate-risk individuals who have been cleared for vigorous intensities by a medical professional, and high-risk individuals who are under direct medical supervision during exercise training.”

Among the physiological benefits of HIIT are the body’s increased ability to use oxygen and insulin, as well as arteries that are more elastic than continuous moderate exercise can achieve.

“We’ve seen, for example, that interval training is remarkably effective at lowering glucose levels in people with diabetes,” Dr. Little said in an interview. “Just one session improves a person’s glucose level.”

A 12-week controlled study in Denmark of high-intensity interval walking for patients with Type 2 diabetes showed it helped control blood glucose levels better than continuous moderate exercise, even though the same number of calories was expended by both groups. Interval training also was more effective at enhancing the patients’ physical fitness and reducing body fat relative to lean muscle tissue.

By making blood vessels better able to expand, HIIT can improve the cardiovascular system’s ability to respond to added exertion. Oxygen-carrying blood can flow more smoothly through arteries that are wide open, which also reduces the risk of a vessel-blocking clot.

The body’s ability to use oxygen efficiently improves markedly “after as little as two weeks of training” with HIIT, the researchers wrote. Peak oxygen uptake — the amount of oxygen an individual can use during intense exercise — is considered the best indicator of cardiovascular fitness and an independent predictor of illness and death in cardiac patients.

“Too many people think incorrectly that high-intensity exercise is only for athletes, that it’s a heart attack waiting to happen,” Dr. Little said. On the contrary, the research strongly suggests, it is more likely to reduce the risk of a heart attack.

In a 2012 report reviewing the effects of HIIT in patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure, researchers in Canada, France and Switzerland wrote that “HIIT appears safe and better tolerated by patients than moderate-intensity continuous exercise” and more effective at increasing patients’ peak oxygen uptake, blood vessel flexibility and pumping ability of the heart.

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are often unable to exercise long enough to gain needed health benefits. But they can do HIIT for long periods with less shortness of breath and leg discomfort, researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens have reported.

Stroke patients with persistent disabilities can also benefit from HIIT. As rehabilitation specialists at the University of Cincinnati wrote this month in BioPortfolio, stroke patients with residual weakness “enter a vicious cycle of limited activity and deconditioning.” But while regular aerobic exercise can improve their function and cardiovascular health, preliminary studies, including one in Trondheim, Norway, suggest that patients do even better with HIIT. The Norwegian team reported that the improvements persisted for months after the six-week high-intensity exercise program ended.

And Polish researchers demonstrated that HIIT could alleviate the rigidity and excessive muscle tone that makes it difficult for Parkinson’s disease patients to move their arms and legs. The researchers, from the University School of Physical Education in Krakow, Poland, showed in 11 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s symptoms that eight weeks of HIIT, three times a week, on a stationary bike had a global benefit, improving both lower and upper body function.

Reductions in rigidity and stiffness correlated with an increase in a substance called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which the researchers suggested could have stimulated the growth and function of nerves normally influenced by dopamine, the neurotransmitter that declines in Parkinson’s disease.

2552,"President Trump has told multiple people, including EPA head Scott Pruitt, that he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, according to a new Axios report based on information from three anonymous sources with direct knowledge of the conversations. Earlier Saturday, Trump announced on Twitter that he would make a decision on the accord next week. Over the past three days, European leaders and even Pope Francis have lobbied Trump to support the agreement, but while leaders from the six other nations in the G7 signed a statement reaffirming their commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions on Saturday, Trump abstained. “The entire discussion about climate was very difficult, if not to say very unsatisfying,” announced German chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly frustrated with Trump’s indecision during the talks.

Axios adds that it’s possible Trump will impulsively change his mind, as Trump has done after telling people he would do something in the past; Axios also points out that all of Trump’s options for withdrawing from the deal would require as much as a year to carry through on, allowing for some additional uncertainty.

Speaking of uncertainty, in a Face the Nation interview set to air on CBS Sunday, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.” Speaking with the New York Times, Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, also made it sound as if Trump was still making up his mind after “a lot of give-and-take between the different countries” at the G7 summit. But according to Axios’s sources, Trump has already made his decision to ditch the pact, and that would definitely be consistent with his numerous past statements as one of the world’s most notorious deniers of the consensus scientific conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of global climate change. He also said during his presidential campaign that he would cancel the deal and has infamously and repeatedly called global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese (and scientists) — but Trump says a lot of things and has, at least a few times, also hinted that he understood the threat of climate change.

President Obama helped negotiate the historic Paris Agreement in 2015, and it was officially ratified by the U.S. and 194 other signatories last year. Should Trump leave the pact, the U.S. would be the first country to exit, which would also be the second time that America has signed onto a global climate deal under a Democratic president only to walk away from the same agreement under a Republican predecessor, as President George W. Bush ultimately reneged on the Kyoto Protocol agreed to by President Bill Clinton in 1997.

America’s exit from the Paris Agreement wouldn’t invalidate the accord, which still has the support of most of the world, including China, and is likely to proceed without U.S. participation. But the failure of the U.S. to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, being the world’s second-highest producer of such pollution, will worsen and likely accelerate an already dangerous problem. If other countries follow the U.S. out of the agreement, which remains a risk, that danger only multiplies."
2553,"President Trump has privately told multiple people, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, that he plans to leave the Paris agreement on climate change, according to three sources with direct knowledge.

Publicly, Trump's position is that he has not made up his mind and when we asked the White House about these private comments, Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks said, ""I think his tweet was clear. He will make a decision this week.""

Why this matters: Pulling out of Paris is the biggest thing Trump could to do unravel Obama's climate policies. It also sends a stark and combative signal to the rest of the world that working with other nations on climate change isn't a priority to the Trump administration. And pulling out threatens to unravel the ambition of the entire deal, given how integral former President Obama was in making it come together in the first place.

Caveat: Although Trump made it clear during the campaign and in multiple conversations before his overseas trip that he favored withdrawal, he has been known to abruptly change his mind — and often floats notions to gauge the reaction of friends and aides. On the trip, he spent many hours with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, powerful advisers who back the deal.

Behind-the-scenes: The mood inside the EPA this week has been one of nervous optimism. In a senior staff meeting earlier this week, Pruitt told aides he wanted them to pump the brakes on publicly lobbying for withdrawal from Paris.

Instead, the EPA staff are quietly working with outside supporters to place op eds favoring withdrawal from Paris.
The White House has told Pruitt to lay off doing TV appearances until Trump announces his decision on Paris. (In past weeks, the EPA Administrator has gone on TV to say the U.S. needs to quit Paris, but Pruitt told aides he'll be keeping a lower profile. He doesn't want a Paris withdrawal to be seen as his victory. ""It needs to be the President's victory,"" one source said, paraphrasing what Pruitt has told aides.)
Pruitt's aides have told associates in recent days that they remain confident the President will withdraw from Paris but they've been worried about him being overseas and exposed to pressure from European leaders and the environmentalist views of his top aides like Ivanka and economic adviser Gary Cohn. Top EPA staff were relieved when Trump refused to join the other six nations of the G7 in reaffirming ""strong commitment"" to the Paris agreement.
One level deeper: If Trump follows through and announces publicly he plans to withdraw from the Paris deal, an administration official laid out three ways he could do that:

Trump could announce he is pulling the U.S. from the deal, which would trigger a withdrawal process that wouldn't conclude until November 2020 at the earliest. Under the deal's terms, any country can't send notice of its intent to withdraw until three years after the deal entered into force, which was Nov. 4, 2016. The actual process of withdrawal would then take one year. In this time, it's feasible Trump could change his mind, the administration source said.
Trump could declare that the Paris deal is actually a legal treaty that requires Senate approval. Such a vote would fail, and then Trump would have Senate backing to not abide by the deal, which he deems a treaty. A letter that 22 Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, sent to Trump this week urging him to withdraw from the deal, increases the odds of this happening, the source said. Trump could also call for a Senate vote in combination with either the first or third option.
Trump could withdraw the U.S. from the treaty that underpins the Paris deal, which is called the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This would be the most extreme option because it would take the U.S. out of all global climate diplomacy. This process would take just one year.
Will we always have Paris? All of these scenarios take more time and maneuvering than a simple announcement, which ensures the debate about what to do with the climate deal won't be over with any time soon."
2554,"Donald Trump’s intentions regarding US participation in the Paris climate deal remained unknown on Sunday, as one report cited “confidants” saying the president had made up his mind to pull out while a senior cabinet figure said he was “quite certain the president is wide open on this issue”.

Trump said in a tweet on Saturday: “I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!”

The message was published as Trump left Sicily after the G7 summit. Leaders of the other G7 nations – Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan – issued a communique confirming their support for the climate deal, which was reached with contributions from Barack Obama in 2015 and signed the following year.

A report from the Axios news outlet, however, cited “three sources with direct knowledge” as saying Trump had told confidants including the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, that he plannned to pull the US out of the deal.

In an interview broadcast on CBS’s Face the Nation, meanwhile, defense secretary James Mattis said the White House had “obviously got a discussion going on about our policy in this regard”.

He added: “And I was sitting in on some of the discussions in Brussels, by the way, where climate change came up, and the president was open, he was curious about why others were in the position they were in … and I’m quite certain the president is wide open on this issue as he takes in the pros and cons of that accord.”

Mattis said that as defense secretary, such negotiations were “not inside my portfolio”, but added: “Obviously we deal with the aspects of a warming climate in the Department of Defense, and to us, that’s just another one of the many factors we deal with which we call the physical environment.”

The White House did not immediately respond to media requests for comment. On Sunday morning, however, the president offered comment of his own, via Twitter, that might have been aimed at the anonymous sources cited in the Axios report.

“It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media,” the president wrote. “Whenever you see the words ‘sources say’ in the fake news media, and they don’t mention names it is very possible that those sources don’t exsist [sic] but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!”
"
2555,"Jonathan Swain and Amy Harder at Axios reported on Sunday morning that President Donald Trump has told ""confidants"" that he has made the decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, and will make an announcement soon, most likely this coming week.  This report will certainly produce a major backlash from the anti-fossil fuel lobby in the U.S. and globally, which correctly views the commitments made by former President Barack Obama under this executive agreement as the main driving force for increasingly restrictive regulations of the U.S. fossil fuel industries.

But this report, if true, should surprise no one after the President was the only G7 leader who refrained from endorsing the Paris Accords on Saturday, a move that came after one of his advisers had told the media that Mr. Trump's views related to Paris were ""evolving.""  This statement was taken by many Paris supporters as an indication that the President might be moving towards changing his mind and keeping the U.S. in the agreement after all.

Such hope by Paris supporters has always seemed like a pipe dream, though, since the Obama commitments within the Paris accord stand in direct opposition to the commitments made by candidate Trump during the 2016 campaign, as well as the energy policy-related actions taken by President Trump since assuming office.

During his campaign, Candidate Trump made pledges to pull the U.S. out of two Obama-era executive agreements - Paris and Iran - centerpieces of his daily stump speech.  At every campaign stop, every fundraising event, every one of the campaign rallies before audiences of thousands of people, Donald Trump overtly promised to end U.S. involvement in both of those agreements, which he regularly referred to as ""terrible deals"" made by ""stupid"" people.  Indeed, this was the overarching theme of his entire campaign - that he is a superior negotiator who would be able to negotiate better deals than these for the country.

Any expectation that he would now, after being pressured by his European peers, suddenly decide that Paris is a fine ""deal"" that the U.S. can now live under seems overly optimistic, to say the least.  It would comparable to Sherlock Holmes, after years of demonizing Dr. Moriarty as the worst villain on the face of the earth, suddenly deciding he's a really cool guy with whom he'd love to have a few beers.

Then there is the reality that, as President, Mr. Trump has already issued a series of executive orders and signed Congressional Review Act resolutions that either reverse outright or order the EPA and Department of Interior (DOI) to rescind or rewrite a raft of Obama-era regulations and executive decisions for which the commitments in the Paris Accords serve as the main underpinnings.

The Clean Power Plan, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) venting and flaring regulation, EPA's methane regulations and stricter ozone standard, higher gas mileage requirements for auto makers, the Council of Environmental Quality's (CEQ) ""social cost of carbon and methane"" construct, the presidential directive to all agencies to consider climate change implications in all permitting, planning and leasing decisions - all of these Obama-era actions and more were considered to be key elements of U.S. efforts to meet commitments Mr. Obama made under the Paris agreement.  All of these elements have either been eliminated or are in the process of being re-written under directives issued by President Trump."
2556,"President Donald Trump has reportedly told multiple people in private that he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.

Though Trump has publicly said he has not yet made up his mind, Axios reports he has privately told several people of his decision, including EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

The outlet spoke with three sources who confirmed the information, though Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute.

Trump tweeted Saturday morning to say he would announce his 'final decision' on whether or not the US will stay in the Paris agreement next week despite coming under intense pressure from world leaders at the G7 in Sicily.

'I will make my final decision on the Paris Accord next week!' he wrote.

The president earlier declined to comment about the accord, as he refused to give into intense international pressure.

Within the Environmental Protection Agency, staffers are quieting down on public lobbying and Pruitt will have fewer television appearances about the issue so that the withdrawal will be 'the President's victory', according to Axios.

There are also concerns within the EPA that Trump could be influenced by the pressures he received overseas, according to the outlet. Earlier Saturday, the other members of the G7 voted to abide by the Paris climate agreement, according to a person familiar with the talks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before the formal announcement.

The leaders attempted to convince Trump for three days - first in Brussels at meetings of NATO and the European Union, then in Sicily for G7, but the former reality television host left Italy without making clear where he stands.

Under the G7 agreement, the Trump administration will be given more time to consider whether it will remain committed to the 2015 Paris deal to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.

Backing out of the climate accord had been a central plank of Trump's campaign and aides have been exploring whether they can adjust the framework of the deal even if they do not opt out entirely."
2557,"President-elect Donald J. Trump has not been inaugurated yet, but he's already backtracking on some of his most high-profile campaign positions.

The latest walk-back concerns global climate change: specificallys the agreement that world leaders recently put in place to rein in emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.

In an interview on Tuesday with senior reporters and editors of the New York Times, Trump said he has ""an open mind"" on whether to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement. “I’m looking at it very closely,"" he said

During the campaign, Trump was quite clear on this. During an energy policy speech on May 26, Trump said: “We’re going to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.""

During U.N. climate talks that ended this week, China emerged as the new leader on the issue if the U.S. were to stop mobilizing international support for climate action, as it has under President Obama.

The Paris Climate Agreement entered into force on Nov. 4, 2016, and sets a goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels through 2100.

It also contains an even more stringent target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, through 2100 in order to limit climate impacts on small island countries and other vulnerable nations.

In Trump's discussion with the Times, Trump said he is also keeping his mind open about whether global warming is mainly due to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, or other causes.


Scientists, of course, settled this matter long ago, with the debate within the climate community now focused on just how severe the consequences of human-caused climate change will be, rather than whether the phenomenon exists in the first place.

Through his personnel decisions, Trump has given every indication that he plans to gut environmental regulations and boost fossil fuel production, including coal, which is the most carbon intensive fuel source.

Environmental groups are skeptical that Trump's statements on Tuesday represent much of a change.

""Actions speak louder than words,"" said 350.org executive director Mary Boeve in a statement. ""As long as Trump has a climate change denier like Myron Ebell running his transition team, you know this is all a bunch of empty rhetoric.""

""... Trump is going on about fantasies like ‘clean coal’ and flip-flopping around on whether there’s ‘some connectivity’ between humans and climate change. The President-elect needs to get up to speed, and fast.”

Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, pointed to Trump's shortlist for cabinet positions dealing with climate issues, such as oil tycoon Harold Hamm for Energy Secretary, as evidence there is not much of a shift taking place.

""We’re waiting for action, and Trump is kidding nobody on climate as he simultaneously stacks his transition team and cabinet with climate science deniers and the dirtiest hacks the fossil fuel industry can offer,"" Brune said.

""Prove it, President-elect. The world is watching.”"
2558,"A proposed secret communications back channel between Donald Trump's team and the Kremlin was reportedly intended to allow sensitive discussions about strategy in Syria, it was reported last night.

Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was revealed to have proposed setting up the secret line in a meeting with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower in December.

The back channel was intended to connect Michael Flynn, who was at the meeting and later became Mr Trump's first National Security Adviser, with Russian military leaders, the Associated Press reported. It came as the nascent Trump administration was developing its Syria policy before his inauguration. The communications would have used Russian diplomatic facilities and bypassed the US intelligence services.

Such a system was never established and after Rex Tillerson became Secretary of State the idea was reportedly dropped as Mr Trump's team decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels.

The discussion of a back channel involving Mr Kushner was first revealed by the Washington Post late on Friday. US officials reportedly learned about it by monitoring Russian communications. Mr Kislyak was said to have been ""taken aback"" by Mr Kushner's proposal.

It also emerged Mr Kushner had at least three interactions, including two phone calls, with Mr Kislyak, during and after the election, that had not been previously disclosed. The discussions reportedly focused on fighting terrorism and improving US-Russian economic relations

Mr Kushner's lawyer Jamie Gorelick said: ""Mr Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.""

She said Mr Kushner could not remember any calls with Mr Kislyak before the election. She added: ""Mr Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period.""

According to Reuters Mr Kushner also met Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank Vnesheconombank and a trained intelligence officer appointed by Vladimir Purin, at Trump Tower in December. The bank is under US sanctions.

The White House declined to answer questions about Mr Kushner's meeting with Mr Kislyak.

But H.R. McMaster, who replaced Mr Flynn as National Security Adviser  said so-called ""back-channeling"" was completely normal. Asked if it would concern him if someone in the Trump administration tried to set up a back channel with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin, he replied: ""No"".

He said: ""We have back-channel communications with any number of individual countries. What that allows you to do is communicate in a discreet manner.""

Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating any links between the Trump campaign and Russia, asked the campaign to produce all Russia-related documents, including phone records and emails, dating back to its official start in June 2015."
2559,"Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring, according to U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.

Ambassador Sergey Kislyak reported to his superiors in Moscow that Kushner, son-in-law and confidant to then-President-elect Trump, made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower, according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials. Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.

The meeting also was attended by Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser.

The White House disclosed the meeting only in March, playing down its significance. But people familiar with the matter say the FBI now considers the encounter, as well as another meeting Kushner had with a Russian banker, to be of investigative interest.

Kislyak reportedly was taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.

Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials said.

The White House declined to comment. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. The Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment.

Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U.S. analysts. But officials said that it’s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow, particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump.

Kushner’s apparent interest in establishing a secret channel with Moscow, rather than relying on U.S. government systems, has added to the intrigue surrounding the Trump administration’s relationship with Russia. The FBI closely monitors the communications of Russian officials in the United States, and it maintains a nearly constant surveillance of its diplomatic facilities. The National Security Agency monitors the communications of Russian officials overseas.

Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow, Kushner’s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary.

“How would he trust that the Russians wouldn’t leak it on their side?” said one former senior intelligence official. The FBI would know that a Trump transition official was going in and out of the embassy, which would cause “a great deal” of concern, he added. The entire idea, he said, “seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy.”

The discussion of a secret channel adds to a broader pattern of efforts by Trump’s closest advisers to obscure their contacts with Russian counterparts. Trump’s first national security adviser, Flynn, was forced to resign after a series of false statements about his conversations with Kislyak. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the Russia investigation after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose his own meetings with Kislyak when asked during congressional testimony about any contact with Russians.

Kushner’s interactions with Russians — including Kislyak and an executive for a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions — were not acknowledged by the White House until they were exposed in media reports.

It is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials. But new administrations are generally cautious in their handling of interactions with Moscow, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of waging an unprecedented campaign to interfere in last year’s presidential race and help elect Trump.

Obama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts, possibly because of concerns about leaks.

The State Department, the White House National Security Council and U.S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders, though doing so for a transition team would be unusual.

Trump’s advisers were similarly secretive about meetings with leaders from the United Arab Emirates. The Obama White House only learned that the crown prince of Abu Dhabi was flying to New York in December to see Kushner, Flynn and Stephen K. Bannon, another top Trump adviser, because U.S. border agents in the UAE spotted the Emirate leader’s name on a flight manifest.

Russia would also have had reasons of its own to reject such an overture from Kushner. Doing so would require Moscow to expose its most sophisticated communications capabilities — which are likely housed in highly secure locations at diplomatic compounds — to an American.
The Post was first alerted in mid-December to the meeting by an anonymous letter, which said, among other things, that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. This week, officials who reviewed the letter and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence said the portion about the secret channel was consistent with their understanding of events.

For instance, according to those officials and the letter, Kushner conveyed to the Russians that he was aware that it would be politically sensitive to meet publicly, but it was necessary for the Trump team to be able to continue their communication with Russian government officials.

In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel, Kushner, Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a “Russian contact” in a third country whose name was not identified, according to the anonymous letter.

The Post reported in April that Erik Prince, the founder of the private security firm Blackwater, now called Academi, and an informal adviser to the Trump transition team, met on Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean with a representative of Russian President Vladimir Putin."
2560,"At this point, it almost feels like the Washington Post is trolling everyone with the amount of fake news they put out.

During the meeting wherein the Washington Post asserted that Jared Kushner proposed a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, it was actually the Russians who proposed it, a source close to Kushner informed Fox News.

The source alleges that the permanent back channel “was never discussed”. What really happened was the proposal of a one-off call about Syria.

Fox News reports:

A December meeting between Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and one of the senior advisers in the Trump administration, and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at Trump Tower focused on Syria, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News Monday.

During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.

The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.

In addition, the source told Fox News the December meeting focused on Russia’s contention the Obama administration’s policy on Syria was deeply flawed.

. . .

Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.

The fake news from the Washington Post just keeps coming and yet they are never to be held accountable for some reason.

JARED KUSHNER WANTED SECRET COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL WITH RUSSIA, NEW REPORT ALLEGES

Details of the meeting follow a NBC report that Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, is currently under FBI scrutiny as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Kushner suggested the use of Russian diplomatic facilities as a way to shield pre-inauguration discussions with Kislyak from monitoring, according to The Post.

Kislyak allegedly then relayed the suggestion to his superiors in Moscow. That was based on intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U.S. officials, although neither the meeting nor the communications of the Americans involved were under U.S. surveillance, officials told the Post.

The source has told Fox News that Kushner is eager to tell Congress about the meeting and any others of interest."
2562,"President Trump's son-in-law and now top White House advisor Jared Kushner proposed a secret back channel between the Kremlin and the Trump transition team during a December meeting with a leading Russian diplomat.

Kushner spoke with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about creating that line of communication to facilitate sensitive discussions aimed at exploring the incoming administration's options with Russia as it was developing its Syria policy, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke with the Associated Press.

The intent was to connect Trump's then-chief national security advisor Michael T. Flynn with Russian military leaders, said the source, who wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Russia, a pivotal player in Syria, has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, often at the expense of civilians during a long civil war. The White House did not acknowledge the meeting or Kushner's attendance until March. At the time, a White House official dismissed it as a brief courtesy meeting.

Kushner's involvement in the proposed back channel was first reported by the Washington Post, which said he proposed using Russian diplomatic facilities for the discussions, apparently to make them more difficult to monitor.

The newspaper cited anonymous U.S. officials who were briefed on intelligence reports on intercepted Russian communications.

The Post wrote that Kislyak was reportedly taken aback by the suggestion of allowing an American to use Russian communications gear at its embassy or consulate — a proposal that would have carried security risks for Moscow as well as the Trump team.

According to the person familiar with the Kushner meeting, the Trump team eventually felt there was no need for a back channel once Rex Tillerson was confirmed as secretary of State, and decided to communicate with Moscow through more official channels. Tillerson was sworn in Feb. 1.

Flynn served briefly as Trump's national security advisor before being fired in February after officials said he misled Vice President Mike Pence about whether he and the ambassador had discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia in a phone call.

Sally Yates, the former acting U.S. attorney general, told Congress this month that the deception left Flynn vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians. Flynn remains under federal investigation in Virginia over his foreign business ties and was interviewed by the FBI in January about his contacts with Kislyak.

The disclosure of the back channel put White House advisors on the defensive Saturday, as Trump wrapped up his first foreign trip as president, and led lawyers for Kushner to say he is willing to talk with federal and congressional investigators about his foreign contacts and his work on the Trump campaign.

Meeting with reporters in Sicily, two Trump advisors refused to address the contents of Kushner's December meeting with the Russian diplomat. But they did not dismiss the idea that the administration would go outside normal U.S. government and diplomatic channels for communications with other countries.

Speaking generally, national security advisor H.R. McMaster said “we have back channel communications with a number of countries.” He added: “It allows you to communicate in a discreet manner.”

In response to repeated questions from reporters, Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn said, “We're not going to comment on Jared. We're just not going to comment.”

Kushner was a trusted Trump advisor last year, overseeing the campaign's digital strategy, and remains an influential confidant within the White House as does his wife, Ivanka Trump.

Federal investigators and several congressional committees are looking into any connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, including allegations that there may have been collaboration to help Trump and harm his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

On Saturday, the Associated Press confirmed that the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has requested information and documents from Trump's campaign."
2563,"President Trump unexpectedly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday after a finding by the Justice Department that he mishandled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails last year.

Trump said he acted based on the recommendations of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who found that Comey improperly moved to ""usurp"" the attorney general's authority and decided not to prosecute Clinton.

""I have received the attached letters from the attorney general and deputy attorney general of the United States recommending your dismissal as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" Trump said in a letter to Comey. ""I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.""

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump said. ""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.""

The Trump administration will immediately begin a search for Comey's successor. FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has been floated as a possible replacement, according to Fox News.

""The FBI is one of our nation's most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,"" Trump said in a White House statement.

In a memo explaining to Trump why he thought Comey should be fired, Rosenstein, who was sworn into office in late April, pointed to the FBI director's July press conference explaining why Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

""The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the director to make such an announcement. At most, the director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors,"" Rosenstein wrote.

Comey's involvement in the 2016 general election didn't end there. On Oct. 28, just days before voters went to the polls, Comey sent a letter to Congress saying new emails had surfaced related to the investigation into whether Clinton had mishandled classified information.

Just over a week later, Comey said they had found no new wrongdoing by Clinton, but the candidate's staff has argued the Oct. 28 letter significantly hurt her campaign.

Days after Trump's inauguration in January, Trump memorably shook Comey's hand while meeting at the White House."
2564,"Just hours after the FBI sent a letter Tuesday to the Senate Judiciary Committee clarifying his testimony in relation to the Hillary Clinton email scandal, FBI Director James Comey was fired.

""Today, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that he has been terminated and removed from office,"" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement. ""President Trump acted based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.""

Trump's letter terminating Comey quickly leaked online.

""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,"" Trump wrote. ""It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.""

Here are a few reasons, both stated and possible, Comey may have been canned:

He hurt the FBI's reputation

A memorandum prepared by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommending Comey's termination kicks off with the fact that ""over the past year ... the FBI's reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice.""

He mishandled the Clinton email investigation

Rosenstein writes that Comey should not have given a news conference last July recommending that Clinton, who used a private email server while secretary of state, not face criminal charges. The deputy attorney general writes that Comey should have turned his findings over to federal prosecutors. He also takes issue with Comey's decision to send a letter just days before the November election revealing newly discovered Clinton emails. ""When federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the longstanding policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information,"" the letter states.

He broke with tradition

Rosenstein cites several attorneys general and other authorities who decried Comey's actions as a ""departure from the department's widely respected, nonpartisan traditions."" Rosenstein writes that ""we should reject the departure and return to the traditions.""

Trump doesn't like him

Simply judging from his tweets, the president and Comey have had a rocky relationship. As Axios laid out, Trump first criticized the director online in July after that fateful, aforementioned news conference. Trump used the hashtag #RiggedSystem. By October, when he was bringing attention to a new cache of Clinton emails, Trump loved him—but in November, when Comey said he hadn't actually found material that justified charges, the pendulum had swung again.

""You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,"" Trump said at a rally. ""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it.""

Trump is embarrassed by him

The president recently accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of wiretapping his phones during the campaign. Comey has shut down this allegation, explaining that Obama could not order a wiretap of anyone's phone unchecked.

""I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI,"" Comey said in March. ""The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets.""

He knows something about Russia

Of course, the elephant in the room is the ongoing investigation into whether people associated with Trump's campaign had contact with Russia during the election. Comey confirmed the probe in March.

""We approach this work in an open-minded, independent way and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can, but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes,"" he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. ""I can promise you, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.""

Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, picked up on this after news of Comey's firing Tuesday, tweeting, ""Trump firing Comey shows how frightened the Admin is over Russia investigation."""
2565,"The White House says that President Trump fired James Comey on Tuesday because he received a brief letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions calling for the FBI director’s dismissal. That letter relies on a longer memo in which Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommends that Comey be dismissed over his mishandling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal during the campaign. A White House spokesman told Politico that Trump did not request the letters, and had no idea that they were coming.

As New York contributor Roger Parloff notes, this memo might have made sense if it was issued on day one of the Trump administration. “But for it to suddenly come out on May 9, 2017, after the nation has watched and listened to Trump warmly defend and commend Comey’s conduct in countless tweets and interviews, renders its content simply incredible.”

Plus, the president’s short letter to Comey says nothing about the Clinton probe, but references the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties, saying, “I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.”

Sure enough, several outlets reported early on Wednesday morning that Comey’s dismissal was actually about Trump’s anger over the FBI’s Russia probe and Comey’s media appearances. The president has reportedly been mulling the move for at least a week — and maybe much longer. It appears this moment from January 22, when Trump greeted Comey by blowing him a kiss and commenting “Oh, and there’s James — he’s become more famous than me,” was a sign that Comey’s days as director were numbered.

According to The Wall Street Journal, in recent months Trump became irritated that Comey was receiving more media attention, and wasn’t using his newfound fame to quash the rumors about Trump’s Russia ties:

The more James Comey showed up on television discussing the FBI’s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the more the White House bristled, according to aides to President Donald Trump.

Frustration was growing among top associates of the president that Mr. Comey, in a series of appearances before a Senate panel, wouldn’t publicly tamp down questions about possible collusion with Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. A person with knowledge of recent conversations said they wanted Mr. Comey to “say those three little words: ‘There’s no ties.’”
Politico reports that Trump was particularly angry about Comey confirming to the Senate in March that the FBI had been investigating his campaign since last summer, and the director’s refusal to back up his claim that President Obama wiretapped him. He’d even taken to shouting at his TV over the Russia investigation:

He had grown enraged by the Russia investigation, two advisers said, frustrated by his inability to control the mushrooming narrative around Russia. He repeatedly asked aides why the Russia investigation wouldn’t disappear and demanded they speak out for him. He would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe, one adviser said.
Only a handful of top advisers, including Sessions and Rosenstein, knew Trump was planning to fire Comey. According to CNN, the pair started fine-tuning their rationale for firing Comey after they learned Trump wanted him gone.

It appears those in the know seriously underestimated the ramifications of the president dismissing the official leading an investigation into his campaign. Sources told Politico that the White House thought Comey’s firing would be “win-win,” since he’d been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans. Trump called several senators to inform them of his decision on Monday evening, and was reportedly “taken aback” when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told him he was making a huge mistake.

Nevertheless, Trump’s security aide Keith Schiller was sent to personally deliver Comey’s dismissal letter to FBI headquarters. Apparently the White House was unaware that Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

Like Comey himself, many top White House officials only learned what had happened from media reports. Yet Trump was reportedly annoyed that his staff was caught off guard:

One source familiar with the President’s reaction to TV coverage of the Comey firing told CNN that Trump was upset because he perceived that nobody was defending him on the cable networks. So he dispatched top communications aides Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders to appear on television to defend the White House, the source said.
While Trump is known to put a lot of stock in how things play on cable news, in general the White House doesn’t seem all that concerned about the optics of the situation. Hours after the news broke, the White House announced that Trump will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday, and a Justice Department official suggested that there could be more firings.

“There is a lot of cleaning house that needs to be done,” the official said."
2566,"With an unanticipated coup de théâtre, Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey yesterday (May 9). Comey learned of his dismissal from cable news reports while at an event on talent acquisition and diversity at the FBI. It was so unexpected that the former FBI director apparently thought it was a joke.
According to the official version of what transpired, the Trump administration decided to fire Comey in large part because of his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. But the fact that Comey was in charge of investigating potential ties between the Trump administration and Russia seems too coincidental to overlook. Many pundits have also pointed out the parallels between Trump’s decision and president Richard Nixon’s notorious Saturday Night Massacre, when Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.
Trump’s administration has already weathered its fair share of scandals. The maelstrom of media coverage and the confusing and contradictory explanations offered by Trump aides can make it difficult to discern which stories are actually problematic and which are more smoke than fire.
So how big a deal is Comey’s firing? To gauge this we first need to know the real reasons motivating Trump and his attorney general. With the administration sticking to its story—for now—here is a ranking of possible scenarios:
Trump fired Comey because his mistakes made the FBI look bad

Ranking: Easy D
On May 8, Comey testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee. During this appearance, he said that HillaryClinton’s top aide Huma Habedin had forwarded “hundreds and thousands” of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, some of which were classified—so that Weiner could print them out. That claim turned out to be incorrect. According to the White House, it was also the last straw: Comey had mishandled the Clinton investigation since the very beginning, the administration used this last mistake as a reason to finally pull the plug on him.
If plain incompetence is indeed the real reason behind Comey’s firing, it would represent the least concerning scenario. As Quartz has already pointed out, the decision could have been managed more elegantly and the timing is bizarre as most of Comey’s alleged mistakes happened months ago. Then again, delayed firings are one of Trump’s specialities.
The silver lining? If Trump is truly committed to investigating Russia’s alleged meddling—and this is a huge hypothetical if—he may be more likely to appoint an independent special prosecutor to pick up Comey’s investigation.
Trump fired Comey because he wouldn’t investigate wiretapping at Trump Tower

Ranking: Sad!
Trump is a master conspiracy theorist, especially when it comes to the circumstances of his own election. Whether claiming Clinton benefited from millions of illegal votes or arguing with the National Parks Service over the crowd at his inauguration, Trump, by his own admission, believes the truth is not absolute.
One of Trump’s strongly held opinions is the unproven claim that president Obama tapped his phones during the campaign. Relatedly, it’s possible that when Comey refused to substantiate the conspiracy, the president grew increasingly frustrated and eventually decided to cook up an excuse to get rid of the FBI director. Comey’s bungled testimony regarding the Clinton emails represented the perfect opportunity.
A vindictive president who believes in alternative facts and doesn’t like being questioned is an unpredictable president. Partisanship is bad enough—presidents should not allow their personal biases to dictate policy and professional duties.
Trump fired Comey because of the Russia investigation

Ranking: Total disaster!
But what if Trump was truly attempting to use his executive powers to halt an investigation and potentially enable a cover-up? This is the worst case scenario.
Comey was reportedly expanding the investigation into Russia’s alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. In this last and most troubling scenario, Trump, eager to hinder the FBI’s search—or simply wishing to avoid a prolonged PR disaster—instructed his staff to find an excuse, no matter how old, to cut the head off the proverbial snake.
Attorney general Jeff Sessions, who had publicly recused himself from the Russia investigation, was involved in the decision of removing Comey and will be involved in choosing the next FBI director. If impeding the FBI’s investigation really was the objective, Trump will now be able to select a prosecutor friendly to the White House. Whoever is selected will also have their predecessor’s fate as a reminder of what happens to directors who dare challenge the president. In such a scenario, it is also unlikely the attorney general (who helped him get rid of Comey) would appoint a special prosecutor."
2567,"Donald Trump has said he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he decided James Comey’s fate – contradicting the White House rationale that he fired the FBI director for mishandling the Clinton email investigation.

Comey had been leading an investigation into possible collusion between Trump advisers and Russian officials when he was dismissed by the president. Defending that decision in an interview on NBC News on Thursday, Trump said: “And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should’ve won.’”

Trump also said there were three occasions on which Comey assured him he was not under investigation. The president said he called the director of the FBI to ask for an update on a possible criminal investigation into his ties with Russia.

In the NBC interview Trump also flatly contradicted his own vice-president and spokesman by saying he decided to fire James Comey before receiving a recommendation from the deputy attorney general.

Trump recalled three conversations with Comey about the FBI investigation into Russian interference in last year’s presidential election. First, he said, there was a dinner which was also about Comey’s future, raising the prospect that Trump could threaten his job.

“He wanted to stay on at the FBI,” Trump said, “and I said I’ll, you know, consider and see what happens … But we had a very nice dinner, and at that time he told me, ‘You are not under investigation.’’’

Acting FBI director refutes claims that staff lost faith in Comey
Then there were two phone calls, one made by Trump, another by Comey. The president admitted: “I actually asked him, yes. I said, ‘If it’s possible would you let me know, am I under investigation? He said: ‘You are not under investigation.’”

The revelations are likely to trigger a fresh storm of criticism. Perceptions that Trump fired Comey because of the Russian investigation have been central to the controversy surrounding the dismissal. Meanwhile, Trump asking whether he was under investigation would not be illegal, but highly irregular. On Thursday, Trump’s words earned immediate comparisons with then attorney general Loretta Lynch’s controversial meeting with Bill Clinton last June, during the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice, told MSNBC: “It’s completely inappropriate for [Trump] to ask that question … It would also be a violation of DoJ rules for James Comey to answer it.”

Asked at Thursday’s White House press briefing if it was inappropriate for Trump to have asked Comey if he was under investigation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said: “No, I don’t believe it is.”

She added: “I don’t see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who’ve been commenting on it over the last hour.” Sanders did not identify which “legal scholars” that she was referring to.

When the president fired Comey on Tuesday, the White House released a memo from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein that criticised Comey for mishandling last year’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Press secretary Sean Spicer claimed it was this memo that prompted Trump to remove Comey, a position backed by vice-president Mike Pence on Wednesday.

Pence said in an interview with CNN that Trump had “made a decision to accept the recommendation of the deputy attorney general and the attorney general to remove Director Comey.”

But in the NBC interview, Trump said of Comey: “He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil. You know that, I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the FBI a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.”

He explained: “I was going to fire Comey. My decision. I was going to fire Comey. There’s no good time to do it, by the way. I was going to fire regardless of recommendation.”

The revelation came amid a flurry of reports suggesting that Trump had grown increasingly irate with Comey in recent weeks because of his high profile, his failure to stop leaks, his pursuit of the Russia investigation and his lack of support for the president’s claim that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama.

In the end, he fired Comey late on Tuesday afternoon, a move that seemed to take many White House staff by surprise. The official reason given was the FBI director’s mishandling of the investigation into Clinton’s emails.

The acting head of the FBI, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Comey enjoyed broad support among its staff – directly contradicting the White House assertion that he had lost the confidence of the FBI rank and file.

Confronted at a Senate intelligence committee hearing with the claim of Comey’s unpopularity, Andrew McCabe said: “That is not accurate.”

“I can tell you I worked very, very closely [with Comey] from the time we started at the Washington field office,” he said. “I hold Director Comey in the highest regard for his considerable abilities and his integrity. It is the greatest honour of my professional life to have worked with him. He enjoyed broad support in the FBI and he still does to this day … the vast majority of FBI staff enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey.”

In contrast, Sanders told reporters on Thursday that she had been in contact with “countless” FBI agents via text and email who expressed their support for the decision. She did not identify them or explain why a White House press staffer would be in contact with FBI agents.

Earlier on Thursday, Sanders told CBS News Trump was “very likely” to visit FBI headquarters “in the next few days”. But later the MSNBC network reported that the visit would not be happening after agency officials told the White House that Trump would not be greeted warmly.

Making his first public appearance since Comey’s dismissal, McCabe promised to tell the Senate committee if he came under pressure to shut down the investigation into possible links between Trump’s associates and Russia during last year’s election. He said he had met Trump this week but the Russian investigation did not come up.

Asked by Senator Marco Rubio if Comey’s abrupt dismissal would impede the work of the FBI, McCabe was adamant.

“You cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing and upholding the constitution,” he said. Later he said the Russian investigation would be pursued “vigorously and completely”.

To reports of Comey having asked for more resources for the investigation, McCabe said he was not aware of any such request and insisted the Russian investigation had the resources it needed.

Opening the hearing on global threats that heard evidence from the heads of the main US intelligence agencies, the committee’s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, said it would not be solely focused on the Trump-Russia enquiry. However, Democratic senators repeatedly returned to the issue.

“It is impossible to ignore that one of the leaders of the intelligence community is not here with us today,” said the top Democrat on the committee, Mark Warner. “The president’s firing of FBI director Comey … was a shocking development.

“The timing of Director Comey’s dismissal to me and many committee members on both sides of the aisle is especially troubling. He was leading an active counterintelligence investigation into any links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or its representatives, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts to interfere in our election.
“For many people, including myself, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the president’s decision to remove Director Comey was related to this investigation. And that is unacceptable.”

It emerged on Wednesday evening that the committee had issued a subpoena for the president’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, requesting “documents relevant to the committee’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election”.

Comey – who found out he had been fired when the news flashed up on a screen behind him when he was addressing staff in Los Angeles – sent a farewell letter to FBI staff on Wednesday.

“It is very hard to leave a group of people who are committed only to doing the right thing,” he wrote. “My hope is that you will continue to live our values and the mission of protecting the American people and upholding the constitution.”"
2568,"As genetically modified (GM) foods are starting to intrude in our diet concerns have been expressed regarding GM food safety. These concerns as well as the limitations of the procedures followed in the evaluation of their safety are presented. Animal toxicity studies with certain GM foods have shown that they may toxically affect several organs and systems. The review of these studies should not be conducted separately for each GM food, but according to the effects exerted on certain organs it may help us create a better picture of the possible health effects on human beings. The results of most studies with GM foods indicate that they may cause some common toxic effects such as hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or reproductive effects and may alter the hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters. However, many years of research with animals and clinical trials are required for this assessment. The use of recombinant GH or its expression in animals should be re-examined since it has been shown that it increases IGF-1 which may promote cancer."
2569,"You don't have to look hard to find genetically modified food on supermarket shelves: More than 85 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States comes from seeds whose DNA has been rejiggered (to increase yields), and those two crops play starring roles in countless processed foods, from soda to salad dressing to bread. Advocates say genetically modified (GM) foods allow farmers to produce more with fewer chemicals—which means a cleaner environment and cheaper groceries for us all. But the question remains: What impact do GM foods have on our health?

The answer is, no one really knows. GM foods have been on the market only since 1994, and research on their long-term effects on humans is scarce. To date most of the studies have been done on animals; worryingly, though, some of those studies link GM foods to altered metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver malfunction, and reduced fertility. In one experiment, multiple generations of hamsters were fed a diet of GM soy; by the third generation, they were losing the ability to produce offspring, producing about half as many pups as the non-GM soy group.

In addition, allergy sufferers worry that, as genes are transferred between plants, allergenic proteins (from, say, peanuts or wheat) will pop up in unexpected places (like soy or sugar). Richard Goodman, PhD, a professor of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a former scientist for Monsanto, says that seed companies run sophisticated tests to prevent that kind of mistake from happening. But inserting new genes into a seed's delicately constructed genome is always a gamble because scientists can't predict all the consequences. There is, for example, the possibility of creating brand-new allergens.

Despite the potential health implications, more GM foods appear each year. In 2011 the USDA approved the planting of genetically enhanced sugar beets (sucrose) and alfalfa (hay for livestock). The FDA is expected to okay a fast-growing salmon in the near future. And possibly on the horizon: pigs designed to produce omega-3s.

Yet because GM foods are not required to be labeled as such, it's impossible for consumers to tell them apart from regular foods. Gary Hirshberg, chairman and cofounder of Stonyfield, the organic yogurt company, thinks that's not right. Last October he partnered with Just Label It, a national coalition of nearly 450 organizations that's currently petitioning the FDA to give consumers a choice. More than 600,000 people have already signed. (To add your name, go to justlabelit.org.)

""The status quo is innocent until proven guilty,"" says Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian who studies GM foods, ""as it was for trans fats, DDT, and countless other harmful chemicals. A labeling requirement would motivate seed companies to prove to consumers that their products are safe, to protect their sales."" Nearly 50 other countries—including China, Brazil, and most European nations—have mandated that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) be marked, and in an MSNBC online poll, 96 percent of more than 45,000 respondents said that they should be labeled. At press time, 18 states had introduced legislation to promote GMO labeling.

Hirshberg, for one, remains impatient. ""I'm 57,"" he says. ""I don't want to wait another 30 years to see what the science says. At this point, I want to decide for myself."" "
2570,"Over the past few years, a number of countries have completely banned GMOs and the pesticides that go along with them, and they are doing so for a reason. The latest country to consider a complete ban is Russia after top government scientists recommended at least a 10 year ban.

The truth is, we don’t know enough about GMOs to deem them safe for human consumption. Believe it or not the very first commercial sale of them was only twenty years ago. There is no possible way that our health authorities can test all possible combinations on a large enough population, over a long enough period of time to be able to say with absolute certainty that they are harmless.

There are a multitude of credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed, and more are emerging every year.  There are also a number of scientists all around the world that oppose them.

By slipping it into our food without our knowledge, without any indication that there are genetically modified organisms in our food, we are now unwittingly part of a massive experiment.The FDA has said that genetically modified organisms are not much different from regular food, so they’ll be treated in the same way. The problem is this, geneticists follow the inheritance of genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to take this organism, and move it horizontally into a totally unrelated species. Now David Suzuki doesn’t normally mate with a carrot and exchange genes, what biotechnology allows us to do is to switch genes from one to the other without regard to the biological constraints. It’s very very bad science, we assume that the principals governing the inheritance of genes vertically, applies when you move genes laterally or horizontally. There’s absolutely no reason to make that conclusion – Geneticist David Suzuki

If anybody ever tells you that we know with one hundred percent certainty that GMOs are totally safe to eat, they haven’t done their research. There is no reason GM foods should be approved safe for consumption, we just don’t know enough about them. We could easily feed the planet through organic, GMO free methods, there is absolutely no reason we need GM foods around.

Below I’ve presented just a bit of information to get you started on your research if you’re interested.

1. Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood

Research from Canada (the first of its kind) has successfully identified the presence of pesticides -associated with genetically modified foods in maternal, fetal and non-pregnant women’s blood. They also found the presence of Monsanto’s Bt toxin. The study was published in the Journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2011.(1) You can read the FULL study here.

“Given the potential toxicity of these environmental pollutants and the fragility of the fetus, more studies are needed, particularly those using the placental transfer approach. Thus, our present results will provide baseline data for future studies exploring a new area of research relating to nutrition, toxicology and reproduction in women. Today, obstetric-gynecological disorders that are associated with environmental chemicals are not known.  Thus, knowing the actual concentration of genetically modified foods in humans constitutes a cornerstone in the advancement of research in this area.” (1)

The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.)  This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.

2. DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

In a new study published in the peer reviewed Public Library of Science (PLOS), researchersemphasize that there is sufficient evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments carry complete genes that can enter into the human circulation system through an unknown mechanism.(2)

In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA.  The study was based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies. PLOS is an open access, well respected peer-reviewed scientific journal that covers primary research from disciplines within science and medicine. It’s great to see this study published in it, confirming what many have been suspected for years.

“Our bloodstream is considered to be an environment well separated from the outside world and the digestive tract. According to the standard paradigm large macromolecules consumed with food cannot pass directly to the circulatory system. During digestion proteins and DNA are thought to be degraded into small constituents, amino acids and nucleic acids, respectively, and then absorbed by a complex active process and distributed to various parts of the body through the circulation system. Here, based on the analysis of over 1000 human samples from four independent studies, we report evidence that meal-derived DNA fragments which are large enough to carry complete genes can avoid degradation and through an unknown mechanism enter the human circulation system. In one of the blood samples the relative concentration of plant DNA is higher than the human DNA. The plant DNA concentration shows a surprisingly precise log-normal distribution in the plasma samples while non-plasma (cord blood) control sample was found to be free of plant DNA.” (2)

This still doesn’t mean that GMOs can enter into our cells, but given the fact GMOs have been linked to cancer (later in this article) it is safe to assume it is indeed a possibility. The bottom line is that we don’t know, and this study demonstrates another cause for concern.

3. New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

This study was recently released by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT), and uses data from the US department of Agriculture, US Environmental Protection Agency, medical journal reviews as well as other independent research. (3)(4) The authors relate GM foods to five conditions that may either trigger or exacerbate gluten-related disorders, including the autoimmune disorder, Celiac Disease:

Intestinal permeability
Imbalanced gut bacteria
Immune activation and allergic response
Impaired digestion
Damage to the intestinal wall
The Institute for Responsible technology is a world leader in educating policy makers and the public about GMO foods and crops. The institute reports and investigates on the impact GM foods can have on health, environment, agriculture and more.

4. Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

In November 2012, The Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology published a paper titled ‘Long term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize’ by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his team of researchers at France’s Caen University. (5)

It was a very significant study, which obviously looks bad for the big bio tech companies like Monsanto, being the first and only long term study under controlled conditions examining the possible effects of a diet of GMO maize treated with Monsanto roundup herbicide.

This study has since been retracted, which is odd, because the journal it was published in is a very well known, reputable peer reviewed scientific journal. In order for a study to be published here it has to go through a rigorous review process.

It’s also important to note that hundreds of scientists from around the world have condemned the retraction of the study. This study was done by experts, and a correlation between GMOs and these tumors can’t be denied, something happened.

The multiple criticisms of the study have also been answered by the team of researchers that conducted the study. You can read them and find out more about the study here.

GM Crop Production is Lowering US Yields and Increasing Pesticide Use

5. Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

A study is published in the US National Library of Medicine (4) and will soon be published in the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology. Several recent studies showed glyphosate’s potential to be an endocrine disruptor. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system in mammals. These disruptors can cause developmental disorders, birth defects and cancer tumors. (6)

Glyphosate exerted proliferative effects only in human hormone-dependent breast cancer. We found that glyphosate exhibited a weaker estrogenic activity than estradiol. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the additive estrogenic effects of glyphosate and genisein which implied that the use of contaminated soybean products as dietary supplements may pose a risk of breast cancer because of their potential additive estrogenicity. (6)

Researchers also determined that Monsanto’s roundup is considered an “xenoestrogen,” which is a foreign estrogen that mimics real estrogen in our bodies. This can cause a number of problems that include an increased risk of various cancers, early onset of puberty, thyroid issues, infertility and more.

6. Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

A group of scientists put together a comprehensive review of existing data that shows how European regulators have known that Monsanto’s glyphosate causes a number of birth malformations since at least 2002. Regulators misled the public about glyphosate’s safety, and in Germany the Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety told the European Commission that there was no evidence to suggest that glyphosate causes birth defects. (7)

Our examination of the evidence leads us to the conclusion that the current approval of glyphosate and Roundup is deeply flawed and unreliable. In this report, we examine the industry studies and regulatory documents that led to the approval of glyphosate. We show that industry and regulators knew as long ago as the 1980s and 1990s that glyphosate causes malformation – but that this information was not made public. We demonstrate how EU regulators reasoned their way from clear evidence of glyphosate’s teratogenicity in industry’s own studies to a conclusion that minimized these findings in the EU Commission’s final review report (7)

Here is a summary of the report:

Multiple peer-reviewed scientific literature documenting serious health hazards posed by glyphosate
Industry (including Monsanto) has known since the 1980?s that glyphosate causes malformations in experimental animals at high doses
Industry has known since 1993 that these effects could also occur at lower and mid doses
The German government has known since at least 1998 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission’s expert scientific review panel knew in 1999 that glyphosate causes malformations
The EU Commission has known since 2002 that glyphosate causes malformations. This was the year DG SANCO division published its final review report, laying out the basis for the current approval of glyphosate
Another study published by the American Chemical Society, from the university of Buenos Aires, Argentina also showed that Glyphosate can cause abnormalities.(8)

The direct effect of glyphosate on early mechanisms of morphogenesis in vertebrate embryos opens concerns about the clinical findings from human offspring in populations exposed to glyphosate in agricultural fields (8)

7. Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

When you ingest Glyphosate, you are in essence altering the chemistry of your body. It’s completely unnatural and the body doesn’t resonate with it. P450 (CYP) is the gene pathway disrupted when the body takes in Glyphosate. P450 creates enzymes that assist with the formation of molecules in cells, as well as breaking them down. CYP enzymes are abundant and have many important functions. They are responsible for detoxifying xenobiotics from the body, things like the various chemicals found in pesticides, drugs and carcinogens. Glyphosate inhibits the CYP enzymes. The CYP pathway is critical for normal, natural functioning of multiple biological systems within our bodies. Because humans that’ve been exposed to glyphosate have a drop in amino acid tryptophan levels, they do not have the necessary active signalling of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with weight gain, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. (9)

8. Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

A new study out of Germany concludes that Glyphosate residue could reach humans and animals through feed and can be excreted in urine. It outlines how presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations. (10)

To this day, Monsanto continues to advertise its Roundup products as environmentally friendly and claims that neither animals nor humans are affected by this toxin. Environmentalists, veterinarians, medical doctors and scientists however, have raised increasing alarms about the danger of glyphosate in the animal and human food chain as well as the environment. The fact that glyphosate has been found in animals and humans is of great concern. In search for the causes of serious diseases amongst entire herds of animals in northern Germany, especially cattle, glyphosate has repeatedly been detected in the urine, feces, milk and feed of the animals. Even more alarming, glyphosate was detected in the urine of the farmers.  (10)

9. Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

A study by scientist Judy Carman, PhD that was recently published in the peer reviewed journal Organic Systems outlines the effects of a diet mixed with GMO feed for pigs, and how it is a cause for concern when it comes to health. (11) Scientists randomized and fed isowean pigs either a mixed GM soy and GM corn (maize) diet for approximately 23 weeks (nothing out of the ordinary for most pigs in the United States), which is unfortunately the normal lifespan of a commercial pig from weaning to slaughter. Equal numbers of male and female pigs were present in each group. The GM diet was associated with gastric and uterine differences in pigs. GM pigs had uteri that were 25% heavier than non-GM fed pigs. GM-fed pigs had a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation with a rate of 32% compared to 125 of non-GM fed pigs.

The study concluded that pigs fed a GMO diet exhibited a heavier uteri and a higher rate of severe stomach inflammation than pigs who weren’t fed a GMO diet. Because the use of GMO feed for livestock and humans is so widespread, this is definitely another cause for concern when it comes to GMO consumption. Humans have a similar gastrointestinal tract to pigs, and these GM crops are consumed widely by people, especially in the United States.

10. GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety. (12)(13)(14)

Deficiencies have been revealed numerous times with regards to testing GM foods.

The first guidelines were originally designed to regulate the introduction of GM microbes and plants into the environment with no attention being paid to food safety concerns. However, they have been widely cited as adding authoritative scientific support to food safety assessment. Additionally, the Statement of Policy released by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, presumptively recognizing the GM foods as GRAS (generally recognized as safe), was prepared while there were critical guidelines prepared by the International Life Sciences Institute Europe and FAO/WHO recommend that safety evaluation should be based on the concept of substantial equivalence, considering parameters such as molecular characterization, phenotypic characteristics, key nutrients, toxicants and allergens. Since 2003, official standards for food safety assessment have been published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission of FAO/WHO. Published reviews with around 25 peer-reviewed studies have found that despite the guidelines, the risk assessment of GM foods has not followed a defined prototype.(12) (15)

“The risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) crops for human nutrition and health has not been systematic. Evaluations for each GM crop or trait have been conducted using different feeding periods, animal models and parameters. The most common results is that GM and conventional sources include similar nutritional performance and growth in animals. However, adverse microscopic and molecular effects of some GM foods in different organs or tissues have been reported. While there are currently no standardized methods to evaluate the safety of GM foods, attempts towards harmonization are on the way. More scientific effort is necessary in order to build confidence in the evaluation and acceptance of GM foods.” (12) (15)

So, if anybody ever tells you that GMOs are completely safe for consumption, it’s not true. We just don’t know enough about them to make such a definitive statement. A lot of evidence actually points to the contrary.

2571,"Activists often cite the alleged potential health risks of genetically modified foods. One recent example of this—”10 Scientific Studies Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health“, posted on Collective-Evolution.com—outlines many familiar concerns and points in each case to “credible scientific studies that clearly demonstrate why GMOs should not be consumed”.

Are these concerns credible? What do the studies cited actually claim?

1) Multiple Toxins From GMOs Detected In Maternal and Fetal Blood.

The blog post sites a 2010 study that alleges to show this danger. The authors identified the Bt protein Cry1Ab in maternal and fetal blood, a protein found in some GMOs, but also commonly used as a pesticide in organic farming. The paper is flawed. The researchers’ measurements were based on an experiment/assay designed to detect Bt’s Cry1Ab in plants, not in humans. As this post in Biofortified.org explains, the pregnant women in the study would have had to eat several kilos of corn in order to get the Bt measurements that were detected in their blood.

Additionally, there’s the “so what” factor. Humans lack the receptors for the protein, so it has no impact on us. Did you know that chocolate is toxic to dogs? Are you concerned that it might be toxic to you? Probably not (if you are concerned, then you’ve missed out on the greatest source of joy known to human taste buds…). Some chemical compounds behave differently among species, and both Bt‘s Cry1Ab and chocolate are examples of this.

2) DNA From Genetically Modified Crops Can Be Transferred Into Humans Who Eat Them

That’s not what the cited 2013 study concluded. The authors found that whole genes from our food can be detected in our plasma. That does not mean that they’ve integrated into our DNA; it means that they’ve been found floating in the space between cells. And that’s any food, not just GMOs. DNA from GMOs behave no differently than DNA from organic or conventional foods

If you aren’t concerned about the DNA from blueberries “transferring” into you, then you should not be concerned about DNA from GMOs either. The paper’s deepest flaw is that a negative control was not included in the sequencing experiments. Several recent papers (see here and here) have outlined the importance of including a negative control in experiments where there is very little DNA to account for possible contaminants from the environment and reagents. (For a lay introduction to the concept of contaminants in sequencing, see here).

3) New Study Links GMOs To Gluten Disorders That Affect 18 Million Americans

The article quotes for an alleged “study” by the Institute for Responsible Technology (IRT). But there is no study on the link of GMOs to gluten allergies. There’s a link to a post on a webpage, but there isn’t a peer-reviewed article. IRT is a one-man band run by activist Jeffrey Smith. It is an NGO that advocates for the elimination of GMOs from our food supply. It’s not a university, college or research institution. It doesn’t do studies.

I’ve written about gluten allergies and GMOs. The Celiac Disease foundation has spoken out against the IRT’s report. GMO wheat has not been commercialized, so any association of gluten allergies with the consumption of GMO wheat is on its face absurd. As for charts that track an increase in GMO consumption in general and gluten allergies, it’s a case of association with no causation (i.e. the incidence of gluten allergies have increased over the past decade and the amount of GMOs we eat have increased too. But, so have the number of plasma screens manufactured).

4) Study Links Genetically Modified Corn to Rat Tumors

This claim is the infamous Seralini paper, which was retracted, and recently republished, in a different journal without being peer reviewed. The paper identified tumors in rats that were fed GMOs and/or the herbicide glyphosate longterm. But the strain of rat used was predisposed to tumors. The paper did not perform statistical analyses and used too few rats, so it was not possible to determine if the tumors were due to the food, the chemical or to the fact that the strain of rats would get tumors regardless of what they were fed. Finally, the findings from Seralini’s paper are contrary to other long-term feeding studies. An overview of the criticisms regarding this paper can be found here.

5) Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cells Growth via Estrogen Receptors

This claim relates to glyphosate, an herbicide used in tandem with herbicide resistant genetically modified crops. The cited paper examines the impact of glyphosate on breast cancer cell growth. In approximately 80 percent of instances of breast cancer, the diseased cells are hormone sensitive, meaning they need estrogen in order to proliferate and spread. These researchers took two breast cancer cell lines: one was estrogen sensitive and one was not, and they examined the impact of increasing amounts of glyphosate on cell growth. They found that glyphosate has similar impact on breast cancer growth as estrogen, although the relationship was not as strong, and it did not have an impact on the proliferation of the non-hormone sensitive breast cancer cell line.

The paper had numerous technical problems, including the absence of data on controls, a potentially critical omission. Additionally, there actually seems to be a protective effect at higher concentrations of glyphosate: instead of reaching a saturation point where the addition of glyphosate no longer has an effect on cell growth, there is no significant difference in cellular growth between the cells that received the highest doses of glyphosate and the controls  (which is why the data from the controls is an important factor).

This experiment was done with cells in a petri dish—what’s called an in vitro tissue-culture experiment. Such research is of limited real-world value. The cells are often finicky and need plenty of TLC in order to grow well; different cell lines can also behave very differently. The authors of the paper note some of these issues, along with the fact that their data doesn’t mesh with previous studies that have examined the impact of glyphosate on cellular proliferation (this previous paper suggests that glyphosate actually protects against cell proliferation in vitro in eight different cancer cell lines and that glyphosate might be developed into an anti-cancer drug!).

Monsanto wrote a response to the paper noting that many studies examined the potential carcinogenicity of glyphosate and none has found that the compound causes cancer. Some news reports misinterpreted the study, writing that researchers concluded that glyphosate causes cancer when that is not the researchers’ findings: they suggest glyphosate may cause breast cancer to proliferate. Monsanto pointed out that even this finding is contrary to the body of evidence that exists on the topic. The authors admit to this fact and discuss the appropriate next steps to examine this issue in mice/rats models for breast cancer. I think that that’s a great next step. I’d also look at a few more breast-cancer cell lines.

This is the most compelling research paper that I’ve read about that suggests a potential health risk surrounding glyphosate. But the study must be reproduced and its issues ironed out. However, as I mentioned, the paper isn’t really about GMOs as a class: keep in mind that only a fraction of GMOs are glyphosate resistant (i.e. Round-up Ready crops) and the use of glyphosate is not limited to GMOs.

Additionally, the paper does several experiments with a compound in soybean whose impact on breast cancer cell growth is very similar to that of glyphosate’s—meaning that there are “natural” compounds in our food that seem to have the same impact on breast-cancer proliferation that this paper’s findings suggest for glyphosate. There does not seem to be a scientific consensus on the topic of soy intake in breast cancer patients, although several publications have examined this issue without finding a positive correlation (examples here, here, and here).

6) Glyphosate Linked To Birth Defects

No peer reviewed, published scientific study makes such claims. The source of this health concern is a publication by Earth Open Source, an anti-GMO NGO co-founded by an individual who also owns a GMO-testing and certification company, and whose business would clearly benefit through the promotion of anti-GMO sentiments (see “About the Authors” in this document).

7) Study Links Glyphosate To Autism, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s

The paper that led to this health claim does not constitute research. It’s a hypothesis and no research was done to support the hypothesis. The paper was reviewed by science journalist Keith Kloor at Discover Magazine who aptly compared it to a Glenn Beck chalkboard drawing.

The claims were printed in a pay-for-play journal (also known as predatory journal), meaning that for a fee, one can get nearly anything published. There have been several exposés on pay-for-play journals, and many scientists believe that the phenomenon is eroding the quality of science (here’s an overview from Nature.com; here’s an exposé of pay for play journals)

8) Chronically Ill Humans Have Higher Glyphosate Levels Than Healthy Humans

This claim is based on a paper published in the Journal of Environmental and Analytical Toxicology, owned by the Omics publishing group- a notorious predatory publishing company.

The authors examined glyphosate levels in humans and different animals. There’s no indication of what the animals were fed, how much, how they were kept or myriad other variables. Any of these could invalidate the study. The researchers do not say anything about the age, sex, weight, height, or genetic background of the humans, or how much they ate, if they washed their food, how long they had been eating organic/conventional diets and, most mind-blowing of all, there’s absolutely no definition for what constitutes being “chronically ill”. Any single issue that I’ve listed here would be considered a fatal flaw that would exclude the paper from publication in a more prestigious journal.

9) Studies Link GMO Animal Feed to Severe Stomach Inflammation and Enlarged Uteri in Pigs

In the study on which this claim is based, the researchers gave pigs GMO feed and non-GMO feed and identified the differences between the two groups. The paper has been thoroughly challenged by many journalists and scientists:

Journalist Mark Lynas highlighted the degree to which the data is cherry-picked. The difference in “inflammation” between the GM-fed and non-GM-fed pigs is apparent only when you break down the degree of inflammation into subcategories, but there’s no difference if you view it as a single category. Overall, there’s a high rate of inflammation for both groups, which is not explained in the paper. At the same time, there are several parameters where GM-feed could be argued as having a protective effect (there are 50 percent fewer heart-abnormalities in pigs fed GM-grain), but this isn’t discussed.
As explained by geneticist Anastasia Bodnar, the authors do not analyze the compositional differences in the feed between the two groups. Previous studies have determined that the environment (i.e., water, soil, geography) of a crop has a greater impact on proteins and metabolites than whether or not the crop is a GMO. As such, the differences seen in the pigs may not be due pesticides or presence/absence of the transgenic protein; rather, they are most likely due to differences in composition of the feed
Geneticist Val Giddings notes that the animals had abnormally high rates of pneumonia, which points to the possibility that something wonky was going on.
In conclusion, even if the paper’s findings are real, there’s no knowing whether that’s due to something associated with transgenes or not, because the researchers do not account for natural variation in the feed.

10) GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence in the sense that the testing methods recommended are not adequate to ensure safety.

Let’s set aside the fact that this isn’t a “Scientific Study Proving GMOs Can Be Harmful To Human Health,” which is the claim set out in the title. There are three papers associated with this bullet point. The first one is a review and I agree with a few of the points it makes. It highlights the need for standardized tests and statistics in animal feeding studies for GMOs, and anyone who followed the Seralini debacle would probably agree. It summarizes papers that have performed feeding studies and their results. However, the review does not remove flawed papers from their overview and nor does it distinguish between feeding studies for GMO crops that have been commercialized vs. crops that have never been submitted for regulatory approval. The paper does not conclude, “GMO risk assessment is based on very little scientific evidence”.

The second paper is also a review piece. The first author is affiliated with “Friends of the Earth,” an anti-GMO NGO. It does not constitute novel research and has a clear editorial slant.

The third paper does not even qualify as a review. It’s a commentary published in 2002 in Nature Biotechnology, which is a high caliber journal. It outlined possible unintended consequences that could happen with a GMO—none of which have ever been documented or identified since then, to the best of my knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the title of the article, none of these studies proves or even persuasively suggests that GMOs can be harmful to human health. The majority are either obviously flawed or are not scientific studies.

The current scientific consensus regarding GMOs remains unchanged: they are safe and do not pose a health risk to humans. However, a scientific consensus is subject to change if there is sufficient reproducible evidence that may impact it, but none of the studies reviewed here constitute such evidence."
2572,"It’s been several months since the intelligence community concluded Russia tampered in the election, including stealing Democratic Party emails and giving them to WikiLeaks.

Yet an unfounded conspiracy theory persists: that WikiLeaks actually got the emails from a Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot and killed in July 2016.

Seth Rich, who worked on voter access projects for the DNC, was 27 when he was killed early in the morning near his Washington home. Ten months later, the case remains unsolved, though Washington police have said they believe it was likely a botched robbery.

WikiLeaks published tens of thousands of internal DNC emails several days after Rich died, leading conspiracy theorists to speculate that the two events were related. WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information about Rich’s murder.

The story is back in the news because on May 15, a private investigator looking into Rich’s case said he had evidence to prove the theorists right.

But the investigator, a man named Rod Wheeler, backtracked on his claims the next day, and the Rich family has sent him a cease-and-desist letter, saying their son was not WikiLeaks’ source.

Even so, some right-wing pundits continue to peddle this conspiracy, most prominently on Fox News. Among them are host Sean Hannity and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

""We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee, who apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments,"" Gingrich said on Fox May 21. ""Nobody’s investigating that, and what does that tell you about what was going on? Because it turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""

Contrary to Gingrich’s statement, the thin case that Rich was the DNC leaker is in no way substantial enough to outweigh ample evidence that Russia was the culprit. Two days after Gingrich made this claim, Fox News retracted its report promoting this conspiracy theory.

Scant evidence that Seth Rich leaked the emails
The latest iteration of this story started when Wheeler spoke to a reporter with Washington local news station WWTG-TV on May 15.

Wheeler worked for the Washington police in the 1990s and is an occasional Fox News contributor. Texas businessman Ed Butowsky, another Fox News contributor, is financing Wheeler’s investigation.

Wheeler told WWTG-TV he believes the local police and the FBI are engaged in a cover-up because of information found on Rich’s laptop and the relationship between the Washington mayor’s office and the DNC.

""But you have sources at the FBI saying there is information that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?"" asked the WTTG-TV reporter.

""Absolutely,"" Wheeler replied. ""Yeah, and that’s confirmed.""

The next day, a national Fox News report said an unnamed federal investigator corroborated Wheeler’s findings. And according to the federal investigator, an FBI analysis of Rich’s laptop found that Rich made contact with a WikiLeaks director and sent him 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from DNC leaders.

Here’s the problem: Hours after Fox published its report, Wheeler recanted. He told CNN that he hadn’t seen the evidence himself, and his knowledge of Rich’s alleged email contact with WikiLeaks came from the national Fox News reporter, not his own investigative work.

""Let me just really quickly say this,"" Wheeler said on Hannity’s show May 16. ""I don't know for sure, I don't know as a matter of fact if the emails went out to the WikiLeaks or anybody else, but it sure appears that way.""

Fox retracted its own May 16 article, saying ""the article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting.""

So this allegation that Rich was the real DNC leaker — and related insinuation that Rich was murdered because of it — rests nearly entirely on claims from a single unnamed federal investigator with unspecified connections to the case.

The theory also doesn’t make much logical sense. No evidence has emerged that shows Rich was so disgruntled with the DNC that he felt the need to expose its leaders to WikiLeaks. Further, the leaked emails were overall rather mild. They were embarrassing and prompted Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz of Florida to step down from her role as DNC chair, but they didn’t expose any conspiracies or illegal activity.

All of this together makes for a pretty flimsy case, especially when compared to the broad consensus that Russian actors were the true culprit.

Lots of evidence Russia stole, then leaked, the emails
The intelligence community and private cybersecurity professionals have widely concluded that the DNC hack and WikiLeaks dump are covered in Russian fingerprints.

The technical methods behind the hack were similar to those used by two Russian intelligence groups, dubbed APT28 and APT29, also known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear. And experts have said that dumping large quantities of stolen political information is a signature move of Russian influence operations.

There’s also the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and the Russian government have a well-documented relationship. Assange has hosted a television show on RT, a state-owned network, for example.

Various intelligence agencies reiterated Russia’s culpability in official reports in October, December and January. And intelligence community leaders and experts in Russia and cybersecurity have said they agreed with this conclusion in testimony before Congress in the months since.

""The final piece of Russia's modern Active Measures surfaced in the summer of 2016 as hacked materials were strategically leaked,"" said Clint Watts, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former FBI special agent, in a March 30 Senate hearing. ""The disclosures of WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and DC Leaks demonstrated how hacks would power the influence system Russia had built so successfully in the previous two years.""

There’s evidence that Russia engaged in cyber operations against Republicans, too, though it wasn’t as robust as the DNC hack.

""The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets,"" said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in a May hearing. ""Russia also collected on certain Republican Party-affiliated targets, but did not release any Republican-related data.""

Our ruling
Gingrich said DNC staffer Seth Rich ""apparently was assassinated at 4 in the morning, having given WikiLeaks something like 53,000 emails and 17,000 attachments. ... It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians.""

There is no trustworthy evidence supporting the theory that Rich was WikiLeaks’ source for thousands of DNC emails. The police believe his death was the result of a botched robbery, not a political assassination.

The intelligence community and cybersecurity experts have reached a broad conclusion that all the available evidence points to Russia as the actual perpetrators — based on technical indicators and an understanding of how Russian influence operations work.

Gingrich and others are talking about an unfounded conspiracy theory as if it's a matter of fact. It is far from it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire."
2573,"On 16 May 2017, Fox News published an explosive report linking the death of murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich to tens of thousands of e-mails allegedly found on his laptop computer. Fox reported that the e-mails were internal Democratic National Committee messages Rich transferred to Gavin McFayden, a now-deceased investigative journalist, who then sent them to the document-dumping web site WikiLeaks.

The Fox report claimed that there was a conspiracy between the local police department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the D.C. mayor’s office to cover up the investigation:

An FBI forensic report of Rich’s computer — generated within 96 hours after Rich’s murder — showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.
Rich, a 27-year-old DNC staffer, was shot twice in the back at 4:20 in the morning on 10 July 2016 amid the run-up to the presidential election. Although none of his possessions were taken from him, Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police consider it a botched robbery attempt, because there had been a spate of muggings in Rich’s Bloomingdale neighborhood at the time.

Almost two weeks later, on 22 July 2016, WikiLeaks dumped a load of hacked e-mails that would embarrass the DNC and create a media frenzy in the months before the election. The timing of the incidents, as well as Rich’s employment at the DNC, led to conspiracy theories tying his death to the leak. Adding to the confusion, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer. Since his death, Rich’s family has consistently denied rumors linking him to WikiLeaks.

The Fox News story about Rich came one day after a report by the Washington Post accused President Donald Trump of spilling classified information to Russian envoys during their visit to the Oval Office on 10 May 2017. Brad Bauman, a spokesperson for Rich’s family, told us he believed the Fox story was motivated by a desire to deflect attention away from the Post report:

I think there’s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda.
The Fox story uses two sources: Rod Wheeler, a Fox News contributor characterized as a private investigator in the article, and an unnamed “federal investigator.” On 15 May 2017, Wheeler speculated to local news outlet Fox5 that there was critical information on a computer that belonged to him, which was either in the possession of the FBI or MPD:

The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They haven’t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer which I believe is either at the police department or at the FBI. I’ve been told both.
Wheeler claimed to have a source at the FBI that “confirmed” Rich was linked to WikiLeaks, and a source inside the police department who told him MPD was told to “stand down” from the investigation. In a follow-up interview on Fox News, Wheeler implied that a conspiracy reaching to the highest levels of the city’s government was at work:

I want to find out who caused that man’s death so we can put them behind bars. But if there’s somebody in politics, if there’s somebody in government, whether it’s the mayor’s office or anywhere else in this city that’s involved, you better believe they’re going to be dragged in and questioned.
We were able to confirm the FBI is not investigating Rich’s murder — it is an MPD investigation.

We reached out to Wheeler by e-mail and have yet to receive a response, but since the Fox story was published, he has been quoted in several news articles recanting his original story. He told BuzzFeed News the following day, “That story on Fox 5 last night was inaccurate. I don’t even know where the computers are.”

On 19 May 2017, the Rich family attorney sent Wheeler a cease and desist letter saying he had violated a contract forbidding him to publicly disclose information about the case and threatening to sue if he continues to do so.

We contacted the office of Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to ask if there was a lurid connection between the mayor, the DNC, and Rich’s death, and got a flat denial from spokesman Kevin Harris:

All claims made by Mr. Wheeler are false and take fake news to a whole new level. The family deserves better and everyday MPD continues to work diligently to solve this case.
We also asked the police department about Wheeler’s claims that the department was stepping back from the investigation. A spokesperson for the department denied it and said that the investigation remains active:

The assertions put forward by Mr. Wheeler are unfounded. The Metropolitan Police Department’s (MPD) Homicide Branch is actively investigating Mr. Rich’s murder  and we continue to work with the family to bring closure to this case as we do with all homicide investigations. If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at 202-727-9099 or text us at 50411.  The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.
Bauman said in a statement that Wheeler was not authorized to speak on behalf of the family, and added the family only learned of the new round of accusations through news reports:

Even if tomorrow, an e-mail was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions, as e-mails can be altered and we’ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth’s murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family, unless explicitly authorized by the family.
McFayden, an investigative journalist who was an early defender of WikiLeaks, died in October 2016 after a battle with lung cancer.

Although the Fox report claims Wheeler is a private investigator, a search for Wheeler’s name on the public lookup tool for licenses in Washington D.C. yields no results. We also checked for a license under his name in Maryland, where his firm Capitol Investigations is based. This search also yielded no results. When we asked MPD whether he was indeed a homicide detective with the department, they only confirmed he once worked there starting in 1990. He was dismissed by the department in 1995, but a spokesman did not explain why.

We sent an e-mail to Wheeler through his firm and have not yet received a response.

NBC News identified the “third party” who hired Wheeler to investigate Rich’s murder as Ed Butowsky, a Dallas-based financial adviser, who is also a Fox News contributor."
2574,"“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.”
- Rod Wheeler, former DC homicide investigator

Wheeler made his comments on the possible Rich-Wikileaks connection in a story first reported Monday night by Fox 5 DC.

In an appearance on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Tuesday night, Wheeler said a ""federal investigator that was involved on the inside of the case"" saw Rich's computer and the case file.

Wheeler told host Sean Hannity the investigator ""came across [as] very credible. When you look at that, with the totality of everything else that I found in this case, it’s very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think, 'Well, perhaps there were some email communication between Seth and Wikileaks.'""

But a spokesman for Rich's family on Tuesday said Wheeler was not authorized to speak for the family and called assertions Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks ""unsubstantiated."" Brad Bauman said even if purported emails were to surface, it would not necessarily mean Rich had helped WikiLeaks.

""Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so,"" Bauman said. ""We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers.""

Although Bauman said Wheeler was paid by a third party, the family is named as clients of Wheeler's Capitol Investigations on a contract signed by Rich's father, Joel Rich.

The family has been sensitive to speculation that Rich could have leaked emails damaging to the DNC since he was murdered during the height of the presidential campaign in a case that remains unsolved. Wheeler and the federal investigator insist that there is evidence to back their claims.

An FBI forensic report of Rich's computer -- generated within 96 hours after Rich's murder -- showed he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time, the federal source told Fox News.

“I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.

The revelation is consistent with the findings of Wheeler, whose private investigation firm was hired by a third party on behalf of Rich’s family to probe the case.

“My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” Wheeler said. “I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters.”

The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.

On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson.

WikiLeaks leader Julian Assange has stopped short of identifying Rich as the source of the emails, but has taken a keen interest in the case, and has not denied working with Rich.

“WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich,” the organization announced.

Assange has not returned a series of recent emails from Fox News about Rich. MacFadyen, who was considered a mentor by Assange, died of lung cancer on Oct. 22 at age 76.

Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department has no suspects and no substantial leads as to who the killer or killers may be, sources close to the investigation said. Metropolitan Police, including the police chief, have refused to discuss the case, despite requests from Fox News dating back 10 months.

The department released a statement on the case saying it remains an active investigation and that detectives are working with Rich's family.

""If there are any individuals who feel they have information, we urge them to call us at (202) 727-9099 or text us at 50411,"" read the statement. ""The department is offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information on this case that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.""

The FBI’s national office declined to comment, but sources said the bureau provided cyber expertise to examine Rich’s computer.

D.C. police have announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Rich’s killer. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman has offered a separate $130,000 reward."
2575,"The life of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer, ended nearly a year ago when he was shot to death near his house in Washington, DC. Then came the tragic and bizarre afterlife: Since July, Rich has been the focus of intense right-wing conspiracy theories that have only escalated as the Trump administration’s scandals have deepened.

As the police have repeatedly stated, there is no evidence that Rich’s death was anything other than the consequence of a botched robbery. But some people, especially on the right, believe Rich was murdered by the Clintons for knowing too much about something. The most recent theories claim that Rich, not the Russians, was responsible for leaking the emails, published in WikiLeaks, that revealed Democratic party leaders had talked disparagingly about Bernie Sanders.

Thanks to an erroneous Fox News story last week, which was finally retracted on Tuesday, Rich recently became the focus of an intense media blitz from conservative outlets — many of which were eager for something to talk about besides the scandals swirling around Donald Trump.

Fox News’s Sean Hannity was one of the most enthusiastic rumormongers, devoting segments on three separate occasions last week to Rich. Even after Fox News retracted its story, Hannity promised he would continue to investigate. “I retracted nothing,” he said defiantly on his radio show Tuesday.

Rich’s family has been begging right-wing news outlets to stop spreading unfounded rumors about him, but by now the situation seems to have gotten out of control.

In death, Rich has become a martyr to the right, buoyed by a host of characters each with their own ulterior motives: There is WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who wants to downplay the connections between WikiLeaks and the Russians; there are the Clinton haters, who want to spread the idea that the Clintons are murderers; there are the Trump supporters, who want to minimize the idea that Russian hackers helped deliver the election to their candidate; and there are the talking heads on Fox News, who last week needed something other than negative Trump stories to make conversation about.

We might not know who killed Seth Rich, but we do know who turned his legacy into a textbook study of where fake news comes from, how it spreads, and the victims it creates.

Seth Rich was murdered in a senseless act of violence
Seth Rich worked in Democratic politics for most of his career. He grew up and went to college in Omaha, Nebraska, where as a student he volunteered on two Democratic Senate campaigns. After graduating, he moved to Washington, DC, for a job at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a progressive opinion research and consulting firm. He was later hired by the Democratic National Committee, where he worked on a project to help people find where to vote.

On Sunday, July 10, Rich was shot to death about a block from where he lived in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of DC. Gunshot detection microphones place the time of the shooting at around 4:20 am. Rich had last been seen at around 1:30 am leaving Lou’s City Bar in Columbia Heights, about a 40-minute walk from where he lived.

It is unclear exactly what happened during those three intervening hours. The Washington Post reported that, according to his parents, cellphone records show that Rich called his girlfriend at 2:05 am and talked to her for more than two hours. He hung up just minutes before he was shot.

The police found Rich on the sidewalk with multiple gunshot wounds, at least two in the back. He still had his watch, his cellphone, and his wallet. There were signs of a struggle: bruises on his hands, knees, and face, and a torn wristwatch strap. According to the police report, he was still “conscious and breathing.” Family members say they were told that Rich was “very talkative,” though it is not publicly known if he was able to describe his assailant or assailants. Rich died a few hours later in the hospital.

The police suspected Rich had been the victim of an attempted robbery. Bloomingdale is a gentrifying part of Washington that still suffers from violent crime. In 2016, there were 24 reported robberies with a gun that occurred within a quarter-mile of the street corner where Rich was shot.

The first conspiracy theories grew out of the “Clinton body count” rumor
Almost immediately after news of Rich’s death, conspiracy theories began circulating on social media. A few factors helped make Rich a target of speculation:

The murderers left behind Rich’s valuables. (Though, by that same paranoid logic, wouldn’t a professional hitman have taken Rich’s wallet and phone in order to make it look like a regular mugging?)
Rich worked at the DNC, where in December there had been a minor scandal involving a software glitch that allowed the Bernie Sanders campaign to access private voter data collected by the Clinton campaign.
Hillary Clinton had just clinched the nomination after a surprisingly bruising primary, and there were still sore feelings in the air.
There’s a long-running conspiracy theory that the Clintons have assassinated dozens of their political enemies.
If those facts don’t seem to add up to a coherent story, well, you’re thinking too hard. Conspiracy theories don’t operate logically. They start from an assumption — for instance, “the Clintons are shady” — and spiral outward in search of corroboration.

On Reddit, for instance, one user wrote a 1,400-word post listing things that he found “suspicious.” Here were some of the stray facts the redditor claimed were evidence of a hit job by the DNC or the Clintons:

Rich’s former employer, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, once did some consulting work for British Petroleum. (“Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public's disdain for oil industry/fracking?”)
Rich once worked on Ben Nelson’s campaign for senator. (“[Nelson] contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009.”)
The political conventions were coming up. (“The TIMING of this tragedy seems too 'coincidental’”)
It’s unclear what any of these facts have to do with the Clintons, but somehow the Reddit user concluded: “given his position & timing in politics, I believe Seth Rich was murdered by corrupt politicians for knowing too much information on election fraud.”

Others on Twitter and the trolling website 4chan also speculated that Rich might have crossed the Clintons in some way. Rich’s death seemed to fit in with the “Clinton body count” theory, which dates to the 1990s and claims that the Clintons are so vindictive that they hire hitmen to murder people they don’t like.

People who believe the Clintons are murderers often point to deputy White House counsel Vince Foster, who suffered from clinical depression and died of a gunshot wound to the mouth in 1993. Several investigations all ruled Foster’s death a suicide, but some conservatives insisted there must have been foul play. They claimed that Foster, who was looking into the Clintons’ taxes, may have uncovered evidence of corruption in connection to the Whitewater controversy, a guilt-by-association scandal involving friends of the Clintons’.

The “Clinton body count” theory has endured over the years simply because people don’t live forever. Any time someone dies who was connected to the Clintons — and since Bill Clinton was the president of the United States, literally thousands of people were in his orbit — this theory is dredged up again by the tinfoil hat crowd. And then it slowly fades.

At first it seemed the speculation about Seth Rich would die down quickly as well. But then 12 days later, on July 22, WikiLeaks published thousands of private emails from the DNC, and Rich became a politically useful distraction.

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks supercharged the Seth Rich rumors
A month before Rich was murdered, the DNC admitted that Russian hackers had broken into its computer network, gaining access to all of the DNC’s emails. The thought of Russian interference in American politics was infuriating to Rich, according to one person “who was very close” to him, the Washington Post reported: “It was crazy. Especially for Seth. He said, ‘Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’ That made him so angry.”

When WikiLeaks released its dump of DNC emails on July 22, the obvious explanation was that it had obtained those emails from the Russian hackers. This connection was later confirmed by top US intelligence agencies, who concluded “with high confidence” that DNC servers were hacked by top Russian government hackers, who had then given the emails to WikiLeaks. “Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity,” the US intelligence report explained, as well as for its connection to the Russian propaganda outlet Russia Today.

But WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied its ties to Russia, and ever since last summer it has used Seth Rich as a way to distract from claims that it abetted Russian interference in the US election. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had his own reasons to fear a Clinton presidency — as secretary of state, Clinton wanted to indict Assange for his involvement in releasing the millions of US diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning.

On Dutch television in August 2016, Assange hinted that Rich, not Russia, may have been the source for the WikiLeaks emails. ""Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, and often very significant risks,” he said. “As a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.""


“Was he one of your sources then?” the anchor asked.

“We don’t comment on who our sources are,” Assange replied.

“Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?” the anchor replied.

Pressed repeatedly for clarification, Assange concluded that “others, others have suggested that. We’re investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it’s a concerning situation; there’s not a conclusion yet.”

As part of its “investigation,” WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 prize in August for information about Rich’s murder.

This is the point where Seth Rich became a prop in a game of international espionage.

Trump supporters and the alt-right amplified the theory that Rich was some kind of Democratic whistleblower or leaker, even though the facts didn’t really fit this pattern. He didn’t have access to the DNC emails, and he had never shown any prowess at hacking — being a data analyst involves a very different set of skills. Besides, the DNC wasn’t the only organization that was hacked: Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s personal emails, for instance, were stolen separately, as were the emails at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Nevertheless, many on the right were inspired by the WikiLeaks insinuations and started to concoct their own conspiracy theories about Rich’s murder. In August, former House speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich told a conservative talk show host that Rich’s death was suspicious. “First of all, of course it’s worth talking about,” he said. “And if Assange says he is the source, Assange may know. That’s not complicated.”

That same month, Trump adviser Roger Stone claimed, without evidence, that Rich was murdered “on his way to meet with the FBI to discuss election fraud.”

To Trump supporters, the claim that Rich had been murdered by the Clintons had twofold appeal: It reinforced the rumor that the Clintons were shady operatives, and it distracted from the mounting evidence that Russia had interfered with the US election — possibly in collusion with the Trump campaign.

In the presidential debate on September 26, Trump famously suggested that it could have been a lone hacker who was responsible for the stolen DNC emails. ""It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,"" he said.

Thanks to a weird miscommunication, the conspiracy theory comes back in May
After the election, the conspiracy theories about Seth Rich faded from public consciousness, as the focus turned instead to the FBI’s investigation of connections between Trump staffers and Russian agents. Suspicions still bubbled in right-wing corners of Reddit and on alt-right websites like Gateway Pundit, and Assange continued to claim that it wasn’t the Russians who provided the hacked emails — but most of America had moved on.

But Rich returned to the news last week, when the local TV station FOX 5 DC aired an interview with private investigator Rod Wheeler, who claimed that sources in the FBI told him there was evidence of a connection between Rich and WikiLeaks:

FOX 5 DC: You have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...

WHEELER: For sure...

FOX 5 DC: ...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?

WHEELER: Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.
Conservative media outlets jumped on the story, which aired the night of Monday, May 15. By Tuesday morning, conservative outlets like Breitbart, the Blaze, and the Daily Caller all had their own pieces relaying Wheeler’s claims.

On Tuesday, Fox News added its own revelation: It claimed that an unnamed “federal investigator” had confirmed that Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. “I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,” the source said, according to Fox News. Fox News additionally claimed this source had evidence that Rich had given thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.

This was a two-source story: The report also said that Wheeler had independently corroborated what the anonymous “federal investigator” had told Fox News.

But here’s where it gets confusing. By Tuesday afternoon, Wheeler told CNN that he had misspoken. It turns out he didn’t have any evidence of his own.

What had happened, apparently, was that earlier in the week, Fox News had contacted Wheeler for its own story on Rich. That was when Wheeler learned that Fox News had a source alleging there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks. When Wheeler went on local TV on Monday night to talk about Rich, he believed he was giving viewers a “preview” of the Fox News story set to run on Tuesday.

That, at least, is how Wheeler explained the situation to CNN last Tuesday. Somehow, through miscommunication or sloppy reporting, the Fox News report used Wheeler to back up its claims about the Rich-WikiLeaks connection. This was incorrect, Wheeler said. He had no independent knowledge.

""I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,"" he told CNN.

Yesterday, after leaving it up for a week, Fox News finally retracted its Seth Rich story, which was down to one anonymous source. “The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,” an editor’s note explained. “Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.”

Conservative media has a field day
It’s unlikely that any of this would have been a big deal had there not been a stunning series of damaging reports about Donald Trump last week.

Among other things, it was revealed that Trump had shared state secrets with the Russians, that he had pressured FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into ties between Trump affiliates and Russia, and that the Russia probe had reached a current high-level White House official, who many suspect is Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

One way the conservative media minimized all the bad news was to focus on other stories. The latest Seth Rich allegations became a welcome distraction from the constant revelations coming out of the Washington Post and the New York Times.

For instance, while most outlets were covering the revelation that Trump had volunteered classified information to Russians, the alt-right website Breitbart devoted its front page to the Seth Rich conspiracy. Breitbart even slammed the mainstream media for ignoring the rumors about Rich: “Silence from Establishment Media over Seth Rich WikiLeaks Report” was the title of one story.

Fox News in particular devoted outsize attention to the Rich story, repeatedly rehashing the conspiracy theory. On his 10 pm show, Fox pundit Sean Hannity devoted segments to Rich on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday last week. “I'm not backing off asking questions even though there is an effort that nobody talk about Seth Rich,” he said on Friday night.

On Tuesday, even after Fox News retracted the story that ignited the latest round of speculation, Hannity remained convinced that the Seth Rich conspiracy theory had legs. “I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com,” he said on his radio show. “I retracted nothing.”

Later that evening, on his television show, Hannity said that for now, he would stop talking about Rich “out of respect for the family's wishes.” On Twitter, though, he was defiant, claiming that “liberal fascism” was trying to silence his voice.

“Ok TO BE CLEAR, I am closer to the TRUTH than ever,” he tweeted. “Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder.”

“Please retweet,” he added.

Rich was an unlucky victim of the conservative media
The recent attention has reignited the old Seth Rich conspiracy theories, bringing forth even more unsubstantiated claims.

On Fox News’s Sunday morning talk show, Newt Gingrich repeated his belief that Rich, not Russia, was responsible for the DNC hack. “It turns out, it wasn’t the Russians,” he said. “It was this young guy who, I suspect, was disgusted by the corruption of the Democratic National Committee.”

On Monday, Assange issued a cryptic tweet using the hashtag “#SethRich” which fanned the flames even further: “WikiLeaks has never disclosed a source. Sources sometimes talk to other parties but identities never emerge from WikiLeaks. #SethRich.”

And on Tuesday, New Zealand file-sharing entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who is wanted by the US government for copyright infringement and racketeering, claimed that Rich had personally contacted him in 2014, and that the two had talked about “a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.”

“I know that Seth Rich was involved in the DNC leak,” Dotcom wrote in a statement.

Rich’s family has repeatedly asked news outlets to stop publicizing these rumors. “Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel,” Mary and Joel Rich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday evening.

“Imagine that instead, every call that comes in is a reporter asking what you think of a series of lies or conspiracies about the death,” they wrote. “That nightmare is what our family goes through every day.”

The Riches also pushed back on some of the rumors themselves, stating that the FBI had found no evidence of communication between their son and WikiLeaks, and that Seth had no access to any of the DNC emails that were leaked:

Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.
But to conspiracy theorists, the facts have never mattered. Fake news always has ulterior motives, and everybody who amplified the Seth Rich conspiracy theories had their own stake in keeping the lies alive."
2576,"In January, a group of Cornell University undergraduates travelled to the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam, a region of the world considered to be one of the most vulnerable to climate change. There they met with farmers, climate experts, government officials and their peers and learned about the ominous changes taking place in the Mekong that, ultimately, will impact us all.

The trip was part of course intended to help millennials better appreciate the interconnected and interdependent world they live in and to fully grasp what is ahead for Vietnam and for them – a grand challenge, on a grand scale. About the time these students turn 50, sea-level rise will have displaced an estimated million residents of the Mekong Delta.


By 2100 much of the region will likely be underwater, affecting millions more. To say nothing about the impacts on major American cities, including Miami Beach, Boston and New York that, like the Mekong, have considerable real estate at risk from rising sea levels.


Changes caused by rising sea levels are already flooding into the Mekong Delta, especially in the rural areas where Vietnam grows much of its food. Our group of Cornell students learned that rains now fall during what was once the dry season, interfering with seed set and reducing rice yields.

Increasing salt-water intrusion is forcing farmers to abandon rice altogether and switch to more salt-tolerant options such as shrimp production and crops such as coconut and watermelons. More groundwater is being used to dilute salty water for irrigation and drinking, which in turn results in land subsidence and exacerbated saltwater intrusion.

From this two-week journey to a country 8,000 miles from home and at the forefront of our greatest global challenge, the students gathered stories to tell and share with the world – because what is happening in Vietnam will be repeated globally.

One of the first things the students learned was that climate change is accepted as fact in Vietnam; it is not politicized, and is discussed freely. Messages to take home, “The Vietnamese people do not avoid talking about the changing climate; it’s happening in their own backyard,” said Conor McCabe, an animal science major, class of ‘18. “Climate change is definitely an uncomfortable topic since it has so many ramifications for society and the livelihoods of everyday people. Taking part in that difficult discussion, rather than shying away, is what I plan to do from now on,” said Becky Cardinali, an economics major, class of ’19.

These millennials also learned that despite the history of the Vietnam War and the role the U.S. now plays in exacerbating climate change, the Vietnamese people were extraordinarily welcoming: “I felt so embarrassed that I had contributed to the climate change that was destroying their livelihoods. How did they repay me?  By inviting me into their homes for tea. They did not hate us, in fact they were extremely welcoming, hopeful and forward looking,” said Marc Alessi an up-and-coming meteorologist, class of ‘18.

One of the more salient moments during their visit occurred when students heard a Vietnamese government official explain that the evidence for climate change and its cause is well established, and for them, it is not a hoax. As the students observed, climate change is not a hoax for the rest of the world, nor is it a distant, future threat: “My time in the Mekong Delta served as a reminder that, for many, climate change is immediate,” said Gail Fletcher, majoring in history and government, class of ’17.

In 2016 the United States and Vietnam, along with nearly every other country on the planet, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change committing them all to a goal of keeping temperature rise to below 20C, maybe 1.5. Eerily, the Peace Accords that ended the longest war in American history were also signed in Paris. A war that cost the lives of 58,000 U.S. troops, many the same age as today’s Cornell students.

“Setting all other issues aside, the Paris Agreement must be backed by all signatories. The bond that can heal troubled relationships between countries can be a shared concern for the future of this planet.

Otherwise, as Earth continues to warm and food becomes more scarce, driving up prices, tensions among countries are only going to rise and result in more conflict, more wars. Regardless of your personal, religious or cultural beliefs, the Earth is going to keep on warming. And it is already happening in real life and is impacting real people. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 2017: time to wake up,” added Jeff Fralick, environmental science and sustainability major, class of ’18.

Climate change is not a hoax to these millennials, members of one of the largest voter-eligible blocks in the U.S. — nearly 1 in 3. It is deadly serious and an issue that just might arouse this sleeping giant. It is their future and yours."
2577,"The basic science behind climate change is actually quite simple.

The story began nearly 150 years ago when Irish physicist John Tyndall discovered ‘carbonic acid’ – today known as carbon dioxide – was one of a number of “perfectly colourless and invisible gases and vapours” to absorb radiant heat.

He also realised just how important this was to life on Earth as without such gases it would be “held fast in the iron grip of frost”.

About 40 years later, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first suggested that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would cause the global temperature to go up, particularly in the Arctic. But the idea remained mostly an academic question until, as he predicted, the mercury started to rise.

This is one of the certainties in climate science – the world has got warmer.

How do we know that the world has really warmed up?

Last year, the hottest on record for the third year in a row, was about 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level, according to Nasa and the Met Office, boosted slightly by the natural El Nino effect. Svalbard in the Arctic has seen average winter temperatures rise by up to a staggering 11C compared to the average between 1961 and 1990.

In addition to thermometer records going back to the 1880s, there is a large amount of natural evidence in the form of glaciers retreating and sea ice melting to record lows, sea levels rising by 20cm, islands disappearing, animals and plants shifting their ranges and spring coming several weeks earlier.

Ironically, the famously impassable Northwest Passage – which claimed the lives of numerous explorers trying to find a new trade route to China – is now so free of ice that people can take a cruise through it on a ship powered by the fossil fuels that help cause global warming.

It is also certain that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased and that human activity is responsible for this. Helpfully, atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from fossil fuels has a different isotope signature to the gas produced naturally.

As Nasa puts it: “There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response.”

How do we know that warming has anything to do with humans?

All this does not scientifically prove beyond all doubt that our greenhouse gases, which also include water vapour, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane, are causing global warming.

But the correlation between the two and the evidence of causation first supplied by Tyndall make a compelling argument. It is as near to certain as it is possible to get without conducting a planet-scale experiment.

Outside of conspiracy theorists, cranks and some of the ruling US politicians, no one disputes the above is true. Even the UK’s leading ‘sceptic’ think tank, Nigel Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), agrees.

What will happen in the future?

Some commentators, including the GWPF, adopt a so-called ‘lukewarmist’ position, arguing that climate change will not be too bad so there is no need to stop using fossil fuels. They point to beneficial effects such as 'global greening' in which plant growth is boosted by the extra carbon in the air.

Others have claimed humanity is plunging headlong towards catastrophe and possibly even a future in which a tiny band of survivors cluster around the last remaining habitable territory near the poles.

Both groups are at odds with the science.

As Professor Tim Palmer, an Oxford University physicist who has worked on reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained in a recent talk at the Royal Society, the ‘scientific consensus’ on climate change is that it could be anything between those two extremes.

According to computer models, developed using mathematics, the laws of physics and the best available knowledge, the world could be on course for between about 1.5C and more than 5C of warming as a result of the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. So far it has risen from about 280 parts per million – a level that had remained fairly constant from the end of the last Ice Age to the 1800s – to more than 400ppm today.

“When we talk about scientific consensus, I would say it’s basically about this [temperature] distribution, it’s not individual predictions,” Professor Palmer told the Royal Society.

But, according to the models, there is a much higher probability of going beyond 2C of warming, than staying below this point, often regarded as when climate change becomes particularly ‘dangerous’.

And, as Professor Palmer also pointed out, there is also “a non-negligible probability of 5C or more, which would be utterly catastrophic”.

Models are often the source of derision from climate ‘sceptics’ or ‘deniers’, but they have actually proved remarkably successful when measured against actual observations. Even Arrhenius’ prediction that the Arctic would warm more quickly has proved to be true."
2578,"With Hurricane Matthew wreaking havoc, the Left is predictably seizing the storm as a means of promoting their radical global warming agenda.

1. The Climategate scandal proved that key data involving man-made climate change was manipulated. In 2009, the public discovered emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit exposing how scientists who have been enormously influential in promoting the concept of man-made climate change actually attempted to cook the books to obtain results that served their narrative that the planet was heating at a dangerous trend due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.

One of these scientists included Dr. James Hansen, a former NASA climatologist who is known by some as the ""father"" or ""grandfather"" of the climate change myth, as it was his ""Model Zero"" that first introduced the concept of global warming. Hansen, Philip Jones, Michael Mann, et al. were all involved in trying ""to lower past temperatures and to 'adjust' recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming,"" according to the leaked emails. The emails also revealed how this cabal of scientists would discuss various ways to stonewall the public from seeing the ""background data on which their findings and temperature records were based,"" even going as far as deleting significant amounts of data. They would engage in efforts to smear ""any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work.""

2. The Climategate scandal was given new life in 2011, with the release of new emails. The new round of leaked emails at the time provided more teeth to the revelations of 2009. Here are a couple of egregious emails from Jones found, via Forbes:

“I’ve been told that IPCC is above national FOI [Freedom of Information] Acts. One way to cover yourself and all those working in AR5 would be to delete all emails at the end of the process,” writes Phil Jones, a scientist working with the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a newly released email.

“Any work we have done in the past is done on the back of the research grants we get – and has to be well hidden,” Jones writes in another newly released email. “I’ve discussed this with the main funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy about not releasing the original station data.”

An email written by Mann showed that he tried to get ""an investigative journalist to investigate and expose"" a climate skeptic scientist named Steven McIntyre.

3. NASA may have also been involved in manipulating data to serve the narrative of man-made climate change. The Washington Times reported in 2009: ""Under pressure in 2007, NASA recalculated its data and found that 1934, not 1998, was the hottest year in its records for the contiguous 48 states. NASA later changed that data again, and now 1998 and 2006 are tied for first, with 1934 slightly cooler.""

Since this occurred at around the same time as the Climategate scandal, Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to get NASA to release their relevant data sets on this issue and was able to expose emails from NASA that revealed a disturbing fact: the agency admitted ""that its own climate findings were inferior to those maintained by both the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit,"" reported Fox News in 2010 – meaning NASA climate change data sets were less accurate than the organization embattled with manipulating data sets.

A 2015 Washington Times editorial also highlighted another example of NASA cooking the books:

Paul Homewood, a skeptical researcher, found that in Paraguay, temperature readings for the 20th century at all nine weather stations supervised by NASA had been “adjusted” to transform a cooling trend into a warming trend. His analysis of readings in the Arctic found that rapid warming between 1920 and 1950 — before human activity could have increased the production of greenhouse gases — were adjusted downward so that the 1980s and ‘90s temperatures would stand out as warmer.

4. NASA also declared 2014 to be the hottest year on record – despite the fact that they were only 38 percent sure about it. The latter fact was left out of their press release at the time, as well as the fact that 2014 was supposedly hotter than the previous hottest year, 2010, by 0.02C – well within the margin of error of 0.1C that scientists tend to adhere by. The Washington Post attempted to spin in favor of NASA by arguing that NASA simply said that 2014 was the most likely hottest year on record – but their press release unequivocally stated that ""2014 was the warmest year on record"" and leaving out the aforementioned key facts makes such a declaration seem misleading, as it's clearly not a guarantee that 2014 was even likely the hottest year on record.

5. There is no evidence that the Earth has been warming in recent years. As The Daily Caller highlights, a recent peer-reviewed study concluded that when accounting for El Ninos and La Ninas – which are the ""the fluctuations in temperature between the ocean and atmosphere in the east-central Equatorial Pacific"" that ""occur on average every two to seven years,"" according to NOAA – there has been a flat-line temperature trend since 1997. In fact, the study found that the El Ninos and La Ninas disproved the existence of the Tropical Hot Spot, which the Environmental Protection Agency claimed as evidence of carbon dioxide supposedly warming the atmosphere.

6. The left likes to claim that 97 percent of scientists support the concept of man-made climate change. It's likely closer to 43 percent. The 97 percent myth stems from a variety of flawed studies, as the Daily Wire explained here. On the other hand, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency conducted a survey in 2015 that found that only 43 percent of scientists believe in man-made climate change, which is far from a consensus.

7. The amount of Arctic sea ice has become quite high. Data from the Danish Meteorological Institute shows that the ""average [ice] extent over the month [of September] is one of the highest in the last decade,"" according to Paul Homewood. This runs directly counter to the predictions of the climate change models.

8. Money from the federal government and leftist organizations fuel a lot of misinformation from man-made global warming alarmists.  Climate change alarmism is an extremely lucrative industry. All in all, there have been over $32.5 billion of federal government grants that have funded climate change research from 1989-2009, far more than any research funded by the oil industry. National Review reports:

Last summer, a minority staff report from the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works gave details on a “Billionaire’s Club” — a shadowy network of charitable foundations that distribute billions to advance climate alarmism. Shadowy nonprofits such as the Energy Foundation and Tides Foundation distributed billions to far-left green groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which in turn send staff to the EPA who then direct federal grants back to the same green groups. It is incestuous. It is opaque. Major media ignored the report.

Mann, one of the scientists mentioned earlier for his role in the Climategate scandal, received nearly $6 million in grants from the federal government. The sources of funding for scientists like Hansen are unknown, the federal government has been resisting Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to reveal them.

9. It is patently absurd to link Hurricane Matthew to climate change. Not just because of the aforementioned reasons, but because as Marco Morano points out at Climate Depot, ""The data show for the last 10 years we have had an unusual drought of landfalling major hurricanes (Category 3 and higher) on the continental U.S.""

""That’s right, no major hurricanes have made landfall for over a decade,"" Morano continued. ""This is the longest such drought on record."""
2579,"One of the main lines of evidence used by the Obama administration to justify its global warming regulations doesn’t exist in the real world, according to a new report by climate researchers.

Researchers analyzed temperature observations from satellites, weather balloons, weather stations and buoys and found the so-called “tropical hotspot” relied upon by the EPA to declare carbon dioxide a pollutant “simply does not exist in the real world.”

They found that once El Ninos are taken into account, “there is no ‘record setting’ warming to be concerned about.”

“These analysis results would appear to leave very, very little doubt but that EPA’s claim of a Tropical Hot Spot (THS), caused by rising atmospheric CO2 levels, simply does not exist in the real world,” reads the report by economist James Wallace, climatologist John Christy and meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo.

“Also critically important, even on an all-other-things-equal basis, this analysis failed to find that the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations have had a statistically significant impact on any of the 13 critically important temperature time series analyzed,” they wrote.

When EPA released its CO2 endangerment finding in 2009, it used three lines of evidence to bolster its argument that greenhouse gases threatened human health through global warming.
The crux of EPA’s argument rested on the existence of a “tropical hotspot” where global warming would be most apparent. That is, there should be enhanced warming in the tropical troposphere — the “fingerprint” of global warming.

EPA’s endangerment finding is the legal basis for agency global warming regulations, including the Clean Power Plan (CPP) now being fought over in federal court. CPP aims to cut power plant carbon dioxide emissions 32 percent by 2030 and could cost $41 billion a year, according to independent estimates.

D’Aleo and his colleagues looked at the data and controlled for El Ninos and La Ninas. What they found was that once natural oceanic warming and cooling events are accounted for, there’s no warming trend.

“El Nino is not by any means new,” D’Aleo told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The El Ninos and La Ninas do not occur at a regular frequency but tend to cluster as we showed in our paper.”

Tropospheric temperatures are mainly measured by satellites and weather balloons, which collect data from the lowest few miles of the atmosphere. Satellites already show only slight warming since 1979, but they are sensitive to El Ninos and La Ninas.

Removing El Ninos and La Ninas from tropospheric temperatures creates “temperature time series each having a flat trend.” Basically, D’Aleo and his colleagues found oceanic warming events are responsible for virtually all the warming since 1977 when El Ninos became more frequent and stronger.

On the flip side, the recent “hiatus” in global warming can be explained by more frequent La Ninas, according to D’Aleo.

“It is an accepted fact that El Ninos bring global warmth and La Ninas cooling,” D’Aleo said. “It is thus not at all surprising that the period from 1947 to 1977 brought cooling, 1977 to 1997 warming and we had a flat trend from 1997 to current.”

With El Ninos and La Ninas adjusted out of the data, only volcanoes are left — base on EPA assumptions — to impact the climate, and D’Aleo’s report acknowledges “it was still possible that the volcanic activity was hiding CO2’s impact.”

Volcanic aerosols can have a cooling effect on global average temperature; the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo caused a dip in satellite temperature data that lasted for a couple years.

“The temperature data measurements that were analyzed were taken by many different entities using balloons, satellites, buoys and various land based techniques,” reads the report. “Needless to say, if regardless of data source, the results are the same, the analysis findings should be considered highly credible.”

Climate scientists have been debating for years over the existence of the “tropical hotspot.”

Christy, who co-runs the premier satellite temperature dataset at the University of Alabama in Huntsville with climatologist Roy Spencer, has presented evidence that climate models overpredicted warming in the tropical troposphere.

Ross McKitrick, an environmental economist at the University of Guelph in Canada, also ran the numbers and found climate models overestimated warming in the tropical troposphere.

McKitrick provided evidence of a phase shift in 1977 from dominant El Ninas to El Ninos — just like D’Aleo, Christy and Williams found.

“Over the 55-years from 1958 to 2012, climate models not only significantly over-predict observed warming in the tropical troposphere, but they represent it in a fundamentally different way than is observed,” McKitrick wrote in a 2014 study."
2580,"Climate change is the biggest scam in the history of the world – a $1.5 trillion-a-year conspiracy against the taxpayer, every cent, penny and centime of which ends in the pockets of the wrong kind of people, none of which goes towards a cause remotely worth funding, all of it a complete and utter waste.

Nowhere is this truer in the field of the environment which, I sincerely believe – and I’ve been doing a lot of research into this – must count among the biggest wastes of tax money in the history of the world.

Last year Climate Change Business Journal – calculated that the total annual spend on the climate change industry is $1.5 trillion a year.

All those carbon traders, climate researchers, renewables and biofuels experts, environment correspondents, professors of climate science at the University of East Anglia and the Potsdam Institute, sustainability officers on local councils, and so on, add up the cost of their grants and salaries – and $1.5 trillion per year is the ballpark figure you reach.

So what does $1.5 trillion look like in a global economic context?

Well, it’s roughly the amount we spend every year on the online shopping industry.

$1.5 trillion on the global warming industry; $1.5 trillion on the online shopping industry.

But there’s a key difference between these two industries.

One exists to provide buyers and sellers what they want – to their mutual benefit; the other is a sham.

Buying stuff on the internet: it’s really useful, isn’t it? It has had a dramatically transforming effect on our quality of life, the way you can order a book at 11 o’clock on a Sunday night and have it appear on your doorstep the very next day.

But how did this marvellous industry spring up? Was it because of all the special incentives and tax breaks granted by wise governments? Nope of course not. They weren’t necessary. The online shopping industry sprung up and grew and grew because it was what people wanted, where they chose – of their own volition – to spend their money.

Now compare and contrast the global warming industry – which I call a Potemkin industry – because that’s what it is: a fraud; a sham; a conspiracy against the taxpayer.

Do you want to have a guess how much that industry would be worth if it weren’t for all the money funnelled into it via government grants and taxpayer levies and subsidies and regulatory capture?

Pretty close to zero, I’d say. Take wind farms – my hobby horse. The cost of intermittent, unreliable wind energy is roughly twice the market rate for onshore wind; three times the market rate for onshore. Nobody’s going to pay that kind of money in the open market. The only way it’s going to happen if people are mandated by the government to do so: which is what of course has happened across Europe and in the US.

Warren Buffett has said it: “wind farms don’t make sense without the tax credit.”

They’re inefficient; they kill birds and bats; they spoil views; they’re environmentally unfriendly – rare earth minerals from China; they’re hazardous; they’re expensive; they’re ugly (well I think they are….)

And in few countries is the damage these monstrosities have done more obvious than in Germany, home of the hateful Energiewende.

Energiewende means Energy Transition. It has been a disaster, as Rupert Darwall noted in a recent Telegraph article.

In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jürgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year; €20bn is being spent on a new north-south high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.

They cause real people real misery.

In 2013, 345,000 German households could not pay their electricity bills because Energiewende had made them so expensive.

That’s the financial damage they’ve caused. What about the environmental damage? Here we are in Germany, the Greenest nation on earth. Aren’t Greens supposed to care about animals? Well they don’t about bats, clearly.

Bats are special. The reason they’re so heavily protected by so many laws is that they are a K-selected species. That is, they reproduce very slowly, live a long time and are easy to wipe out. Having evolved with few predators – flying at night helps – bats did very well with this strategy until the modern world.

But now we have all those eco-friendly wind turbines. Or as I call them bird-slicing, bat-chomping eco-crucifixes. A recent study in Germany by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research showed that bats killed by German turbines may have come from places 1000 or more miles away. This would suggest that German turbines – which one study claims kill more than 200,000 bats a year – may be depressing populations across the entire northeastern portion of Europe.

Why would anyone put up such things. One reason and one reason only: follow the money.

Where does the money come from? Us!

Who made the decision to spend that money? Not us.

Oh definitely not us. Had it been us we might have done a bit of basic due diligence.

Like, OK, so these wind turbines are necessary you say to save the planet from the threat of catastrophic and unprecedented man-made global warming?

Correct.

So has the planet ever been as warm in human history as it is today?

Well, only in the Minoan warming period and the Roman warming period and the Medieval warming period.

Just those. Right. And presumably back then all that CO2 heavy industry was burning was a real problem? No just kidding…Out of interest how much has the planet warmed in the last few years?

About 0.8 degrees C since 1850.

Right so since the end of the Little Ice Age (so called because it was characterised by unpleasant cold) and years like the infamous Year Without A Summer (1816), the planet has heated by less than the temperature increase you’d get on a spring day between say breakfast and mid-morning coffee time?

Ah yes but the computer models…

Indeed the computer models. Those amazing models which have been predicting catastrophic, runaway warming, when there has been no significant warming since 1998 – so for eighteen years there has been no global warming?

Ah yes but the temperatures of February 2016….

Look I could go on like this forever. I’ve been listening to these increasingly desperate excuses for decades. Perhaps some of you here believe them – if so, there’s a bridge I’d like to sell you…

But it really doesn’t matter whether you believe in global warming or not because here’s the reality:

All that money we’re being to spend on the global warming industry – that $1.5 trillion I mentioned earlier siphoned straight out of taxpayers’ pockets – it isn’t going to make the blindest bit of difference.

No, I exaggerate. It will make a teeny weeny bit of difference. Bjorn Lomborg has done the calculations. You’re going to love this, if you haven’t heard this before. These figures are just amazing.

So recently you’ll recall there was a big UN climate conference in Paris COP 21 and all the leaders of the world flew in to save the planet from global warming. But before they turned up, each delegate nation made a voluntary agreement as to how much it was going to cut its carbon emissions. Not compulsory, note. So these countries are free at any stage to abandon their carbon reduction targets – as funnily enough South Korea did last week. This is how much – best case scenario – that various countries are prepared to do to combat climate change.

So Lomborg added up all the countries INDCs – that stands for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions – and worked out, using the climate alarmists’ own models, what effect all this would have on global temperature.

Do you want to know how much? (Oh this is the optimistic scenario by the way, not the pessimistic one).

If all the countries do their bit then the total reduction in global warming – by the year 2100 will be 0.170 degrees Centigrade.

As a climate sceptic friend of mine pointed out at the time, you’d experience a bigger temperature increase than that just walking down from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel tower.

So there’s your deal folks: you – and taxpayers like you – are paying $1.5 trillion a year to reduce the world’s temperatures by the end of this century by 0.170.

It’s so perfectly ridiculous it’s almost funny.

And I suppose on a personal level I shouldn’t complain. I call climate change “the gift that goes on giving” because day in day out I get an endless stream of stories to write about the corruption, incompetence, skullduggery of the climate alarmism industry.

But, putting my career aside for the moment, is this really a world we’d like to live in? Can it be right that people who have worked hard for their money should have it taken from them and then wasted in so spectacular fashion?

And it’s not just the waste that’s so bad it’s worse than that.

If it were simply a form of taxpayer-funded welfare scheme for otherwise unemployable environmental sciences graduates that would be one thing.

But this is causing real, lasting harm in any number of ways.

The corrupting effects on science – and the scientific method – which at times are almost redolent of Lysenkoism of the Stalin era.

The brainwashing of schoolchildren such as you might have found with the Young Pioneers.

The economic damage caused by the misallocation of resources, as so frequently happens in Communist countries

The pollution caused by diesel (introduced, on EU recommendation, because it’s supposedly more CO2-friendly) which calls to mind Chernobyl or the poisoning of the Aral Sea.

The human suffering of those 345,000 German households I mentioned who can’t pay their electricity bills.

Does this authoritarianism and corruption and incompetence remind you of anything?

Well it has often been said – and there is much anecdotal evidence to support this – that after the Berlin Wall came down the left had a bit of a problem. Capitalism had won the economic argument. Where could the left go next?

But the solution was there waiting them – the green movement. In the guise of saving the world’s environment they could advance all their usual obsessions – control, regulation, state intervention, puritanism, compulsory immiseration – though this time with a smiling, fluffy face. Watermelons they call them: green on the outside, red on the inside.

So the Berlin Wall came down but it never really went away.

And sometimes I look at the world and what has been happening with the rise and rise of green lunacy and I ask myself: did the right side really win the Cold War or is it just an illusion?"
2581,"Yet more bad news for Obamacare this week: Molina Healthcare lost $110 million on the exchanges last year, and the CEO told investors, “There are simply too many unknowns with the marketplace program to commit to our participation beyond 2017.”

At first glance, it’s hard to see why this piece of news is worth worrying about. UnitedHealth recently projected several times those losses, and it's a bigger player on the exchanges. Why spend so much time looking at one modest-size insurer?

Because Molina is one of the companies that has been repeatedly pointed to, by virtually every health-care-policy wonk in the business, as one of the “bright spots” on the exchanges. Molina is a company that specializes in covering poor people. Before Obamacare, they were a sizable player in the “Medicaid managed care” model, and it seemed like the expertise they’d thusly acquired was allowing them to design the sort of plans that actually made money on the exchanges. Which is to say bare bones plans, not fancy but adequate. Apparently, that’s no longer a money-maker, at least for Molina.

This isn’t necessarily the pattern we’ve seen with other insurers. Molina seems to have made money until it was forced to pay into a fund designed to transfer money from insurers that ended up with an unusually healthy patient pool, to those who got stuck with the sicker patients. Those losses were partially offset by lower medical costs than they expected, which is certainly good news. But it’s not great news. Lower-than-expected costs can be from the system working well, or they can simply come from the fact that you happened to get a healthier insurance pool. If the government makes you give the latter gains back, and more, then you’re still not going to be profitable. And insurers that aren’t profitable over the long term aren’t going to stick around.
Nor can you fix the problem by adjusting the transfer fund. Those losses are occurring somewhere in the market; someone has to pay for the care. If you got rid of Obamacare’s risk transfer provisions, those insurers would lose more money, and exit the market, and the patients would end up with some other insurer. Who would then lose a bunch of money on them. Unless the insurance market is profitable in aggregate, the exchanges are not going to stabilize.

Molina’s losses suggest that instead of stabilizing, the exchanges are getting worse. There is no way to fix Obamacare without fixing the pool so that younger, healthier people buy insurance.

Democrats had six years to come up with a way to do that (or perhaps I should say, a way to do that that could actually get through Congress without hordes of angry voters burning their representatives in effigy). They failed. Now Republicans are taking their shot, and so far at least, they don’t seem any more on target than Democrats were.

The life expectancy of the individual market for health insurance is not looking good."
2582,"Congressional Republicans, evidently hoping that by repeating an untruth they’ll convince American voters, and perhaps themselves, that it’s a truth, on Wednesday said the Affordable Care Act has “failed.”

The undistilled version of this view came from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who emerged Wednesday from a meeting with Vice President-elect Mike Pence to assert: “This law has failed. Americans are struggling. The law is failing while we speak. … Things are only getting worse under Obamacare. … The healthcare system has been ruined — dismantled — under Obamacare.”

Every one of those statements is demonstrably untrue. How do we know this? We know because every measure of healthcare spending, access and cost has improved since the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Timothy McBride of Washington University in St. Louis has done the heavy lifting of pulling together the relevant charts and graphs, and posting them online in a series of 12 tweets compiled on Storify. We’ve culled some of the most important, and present them here.

We should add, first, that Ryan also pledged, once the GOP repeals the law, to “make sure that there is a stable transition to a truly patient-centered system. We want every American to have access to quality, affordable health coverage”

This is nothing but fatuous gobbledygook. The GOP has had six years to come up with an alternative plan, and never has done so. Its current strategy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act now, and then cook up a replacement sometime in the next two, three, even four years. (They can’t even agree on a time frame.) What exactly is a “patient-centered system,” anyway?

Here are the charts, courtesy of professor McBride.

First, the overall uninsured rate has come sharply down since the advent of Obamacare:
The uninsured rate for non-elderly adults fell from nearly 16% in 2010 to less than 10%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's now at a historic low.
The decline in uninsured rates was especially pronounced among lower-income Americans, according to the Council of Economic Advisors and other sources:

Uninsured rates fell by more than 10 percentage points among the poorest Americans eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act — those earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line.
Although Republicans claim that even if the Affordable Care Act brought down the uninsured rate, its enrollees had trouble seeing a doctor, that isn’t true. Numerous studies debunk claims that doctors shun Affordable Care Act enrollees. This sample by the Council of Economic Advisors shows that the decline in the uninsured rate is closely associated with a reduction in people who were prevented from seeking and finding medical care because of its cost:

Hospitals are major beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act, as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Council of Economic Advisors report. Hospitals’ uncompensated care costs fell sharply in Medicaid expansion states, as patients treated as indigent in the past are now covered by Medicaid. Their uncompensated care costs fell from an average 4% of operating costs before the Affordable Care Act to less than 2% afterward, a decline worth tens of billions of dollars nationwide.

Overall national health spending has come down even faster than was predicted, as a share of gross domestic product:


The average growth in per-enrollee spending by private health plans in key categories has slowed materially since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, from annual growth averaging 5% in 2000-2010, to 1.5% in 2010-2015. Spending growth on hospital services, physician services and prescription drugs all slowed. Medicare, which has instituted numerous cost-control initiatives under the Affordable Care Act, has seen an overall decline in spending per enrollee.

Finally, even though employer-based insurance hasn’t yet been directly affected by the Affordable Care Act, there seems to be a spillover effect from the overall reduction in healthcare spending growth. Premiums rose by an average 5.6% a year in the 10 years prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, but only 3.1% since, according to Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual survey of employer health benefits.


Republicans have promised to give Americans a health insurance system better than the Affordable Care Act’s and at lower cost. This is almost surely a chimera; no plan that the GOP has considered would expand coverage beyond the Affordable Care Act. To the extent that the plans would reduce costs, they would do so by relieving the federal government of responsibility for paying for coverage and placing it even more heavily on the shoulders of individuals and families. That’s not lowering costs; it’s just shifting them to those least able to pay. The fact that the GOP will have to face is that bringing healthcare to more Americans costs money. Taking it away from millions of Americans will cost money, too.

No one claimed, either before the passage of the Affordable Care Act or afterward, that it was perfect or that it would solve America’s healthcare crisis in one swipe. What became evident in the three years since the individual insurance exchanges opened for business (on Jan. 1, 2014) is that the subsidies for premiums needed to be increased and improved. Because they’re inadequate, especially as households cross the threshold of 400% of the federal poverty line at which subsidies are eliminated — at about $97,200 for a family of four — middle-class families in the individual insurance market feel overburdened. They blame Obamacare for this injustice. The real culprits are Republicans who have refused to consider any approach to the Affordable Care Act except repeal. Now the GOP is “it” on healthcare, and it’s discovering that crafting a solution from scratch may be almost impossible.

What became evident during the most recent open-enrollment period for Obamacare exchanges is that “Obamacare is more popular than ever,” as Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observes. Enrollment grew to 12 million, up by about 1 million from 2015, even in the face of higher premiums. In any case, more than 85% of all enrollees are entitled to subsidies, which limits and in some cases cancels out the higher prices.

Yet the GOP pledges to overturn all that. The question the party never has found an answer to is: If this is what a failure looks like, how would it define a success?"
2583,"Did Obamacare work?

It’s worth reflecting upon after President Trump and House Republicans failed on Friday to repeal and replace the “disaster” of Obamacare.

Ever since the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, it has been so contentious that it can be difficult to see beyond the partisan debate. But by looking at the many ways the law has changed health care, it’s possible to hazard some judgments.

The answer may vary with your own experience, but it ultimately depends on what you value. For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to bring health insurance to more Americans, the rational answer should be: Yes, Obamacare succeeded. More than 20 million Americans gained health coverage through the law.

Continue reading the main story
For those who believe the primary goal of the law should have been to make health insurance affordable to all who want it, the rational answer is: No, Obamacare did not achieve uniform affordability. Health care in the United States remains the most expensive in the world, and coverage remains out of the financial reach of many Americans.

For those who believe the primary goal of the law was to make Americans healthier, the answer has to be: It is too soon to tell.

One thing is clear, though — the Affordable Care Act has shifted the nation’s baseline expectations for how health care should work. Its successes have pushed Republican politicians, like Mr. Trump, into making expansive promises to provide insurance to all Americans. Its failures have become focal points, too, leading to calls for lower insurance deductibles and for more choices in doctors and hospitals.

Since Republicans took power, public opinion has suddenly tipped in its favor. For lots of people, “Obamacare” has become synonymous with the health care system itself, with its many miracles and dysfunctions.

There are layers beneath each judgment, of course. The law was broad and complex, with many goals and provisions. This assessment touches on its largest achievements and its biggest disappointments. For many important questions, there is not yet strong evidence either way.

Successes:

Twenty million more people have health insurance.

Providing health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacare’s principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded. The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.

Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an “individual mandate” to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.

The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn’t get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.

It has made many Americans more financially secure.

Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law’s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.
It has reduced inequality.

In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration’s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.

It made health insurance more comprehensive.

Before Obamacare, many products could be called “health insurance.” Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can’t cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law’s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients’ access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.

It lowered the federal deficit.

Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law’s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)

Failures:

Health insurance remains very expensive.

Obamacare’s marketplaces and Medicaid expansion make health coverage a good deal for those near the poverty line, but those earning not much more still often struggle to pay health plan premiums, and face deductibles that are much higher than those seen in a typical employer health plan. In the law’s first three years, premiums were lower than expected and grew slowly. But prices shot up this year, causing financial shocks for buyers who don’t receive government help in paying their premiums. Several analysts believe the increases resulted from recent policy changes and too-low early pricing and may represent a one-time market correction. Insurers have also said that they have found the pool of Obamacare enrollees to be sicker and less predictable in their health care needs than expected. Some people who earn enough to qualify for meager or no subsidies find health care unaffordable.

The health care system remains complex and confusing.

President Barack Obama has described the health law’s markets as being like a Kayak or an Amazon for health insurance. They’re not. Health insurance is easier to shop for now, but it remains a complicated and opaque product, and selecting the right health plan is often frustrating or impossible for Americans unsure of their health needs — or unable to decode jargon like “out-of-pocket maximum” or “in-network provider.” After picking their insurance, patients can still struggle to use it, and can get stuck with surprise bills or long negotiations with their insurance companies.

In many parts of the country, only one insurer even offers health plans, limiting the choices available to consumers.

If you like your plan, you can’t always keep your plan. ...

The Obamacare marketplaces are set up to encourage customers to frequently switch their health plans to avoid steep price increases. The markets have also been turbulent, with insurers going out of business, exiting markets or shifting around their offerings each year. That has led to a large fraction of renewing customers who change health plans every year, unable to pick a plan they like and stick with it.

… Or your doctor.

Many Obamacare health plans, trying to keep prices competitive, have sharply limited the number of doctors or hospitals they will cover. Obamacare’s authors did not expect so-called narrow network plans to become so widespread. These have made it hard for some customers to find any plan that includes their favored providers, and means that switching plans often means switching doctors, too. The narrower networks, despite their inconveniences, have helped keep insurance prices lower.

Too Soon to Tell:

We don’t know if the law made America healthier.

Health insurance is not the same thing as health, and we still have very limited data about whether the law’s coverage expansion has lengthened lives or improved their quality in meaningful ways. There is some encouraging but very early evidence that low-income people in two states that expanded Medicaid reported improving overall health compared with their low-income neighbors in a state that did not. And there is research that more low-income Americans have visited a doctor and have received some basic preventive health services, including prescription contraceptives and treatments for diabetes.

But it will probably take many more years before it is clear whether the law has been beneficial to public health, or how large that effect may be. Even though the law allowed 20 million more people to get coverage, that’s a small fraction of the nation’s population, and it often takes years for health care services to result in measurable benefits.

It’s unclear what the law has done to national health spending.

A crucial goal for Mr. Obama was “bending the cost curve” and slowing the accelerating cost of health care in the United States. Growth in health spending has indeed slowed in the years since Obamacare’s passage, but it is hard to untangle the effects of the health law from other forces affecting health spending, including the Great Recession, rising insurance deductibles and a slowdown in the development of new medical technologies. The health law’s most ardent champions, including Mr. Obama, credit it for this change. But many economists are uncertain whether the slowdown is a result of the law or a mere coincidence.

It may have improved the quality of care in hospitals.

The health law contained many provisions intended to make medical care safer and more evidence-based. The health system is still often a dangerous place for patients, but fewer are contracting infections in the hospital, for example, or leaving the hospital only to be readmitted in a few weeks. Some trends were underway before the health law passed, so it is difficult to tease out how much change was caused by Obamacare or would have happened anyway."
2584,"Millions may lose coverage next year if Congress does not repeal Obamacare. That’s not what this week’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis says, but it is reality. CBO’s estimating models seem impervious to reality. In the real world, the Obamacare exchanges are in crisis, millions of uninsured people willingly pay or avoid IRS penalties, and consumers struggle with rising premiums and cost-sharing requirements. But for CBO, Obamacare is a sea of tranquility. The agency assumes that only 26 million people under the age of 65 will be uninsured this year and next if Obamacare is left in place. To hit that mark, 2 million fewer people would have to be uninsured this year than last. That seems unlikely. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 27.9 million people under age 65 lacked coverage as of September 30 last year, the most recent date for which government survey data are available. That represents little improvement over its estimate of 28.4 million as of December 2015, meaning that the number of non-elderly uninsured declined by only half a million through the first nine months of last year. Since then, the Obamacare individual exchanges have begun to implode. Fewer people signed up during the open-enrollment period this year than last, due in part to premium hikes that averaged 25 percent. Other insurance companies didn’t bother raising prices; they fled the exchanges. By January, 1,000 counties were down to their last insurer. Five entire states have just a single company selling through the exchanges. A rational observer might worry that the exchanges were on the brink of doom. Not CBO. Its analysts believe that Obamacare is on the cusp of a miracle. The number of nonelderly uninsured not only will drop this year but hold steady in 2018, according to CBO, even though millions could find themselves without an insurer in their exchanges. That improbably happy outcome would change, the agency says, if Congress were to enact its repeal bill. In that case, CBO warns, the number of uninsured will abruptly increase by 4 million. That includes 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. CBO believes they will drop out of a program for which they pay virtually nothing and that fully pays virtually all their medical expenses. Ditto for 1 million people in the exchanges and an additional million with job-based coverage. CBO believes that these 4 million people so detest being insured that they will drop out of the system immediately after Congress repeals the tax on the uninsured. That number will rise to 14 million next year, according to CBO. That includes 5 million who will abandon Medicaid, 2 million who will drop their employer-sponsored coverage, and 6 million who will leave the exchanges. These 14 million people will not, despite what you’ve read, “lose coverage.” For the most part, CBO says, they “will choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying penalties” [emphasis added]. The GOP bill not only retains existing subsidies and Medicaid expansion through 2019, it provides additional money to states to stabilize their failing Obamacare exchanges. But that spending, according to CBO, won’t halt the stampede to the Obamacare exits induced by repeal of the individual mandate. CBO’s illusions about the effectiveness of the mandate don’t square with reality. The evidence suggests that the mandate has done little to reduce the number of uninsured. The IRS reports that in 2015, 6.5 million paid the penalty, 12.7 million obtained an exemption, while 4.3 million simply ignored it. That’s 23.5 million people who have chosen to be uninsured despite the government’s threat of tax penalties. CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. Let’s do the math. NHIS estimates that 44.3 million non-elderly were uninsured in 2013, the year before Obamacare was fully implemented. If CBO is to be believed, the number of uninsured will increase by 14 million next year, joining another 23.5 million uninsured people who either paid the tax in the past or found a way to avoid it. That would mean that 85 percent of the uninsured (37.5 million out of 44.3 million) apparently would want nothing to do with Obamacare’s government-defined and subsidized benefits were Congress to repeal the individual mandate. If CBO is correct, the government will have spent $462 billion between 2014 and 2018 on subsidies and Medicaid expansions, only to end up reducing the number of nonelderly uninsured from 44.3 million to 41 million. It is also possible that CBO is wrong about the individual mandate. That seems intuitively obvious to people whose heads aren’t buried in CBO’s faulty models. Some future progressive government may well decide to attack the problem of homelessness by supplementing the mortgage-interest deduction with a tax on the homeless. But does anyone believe that if a Republican Congress repealed that tax, homeowners would shred their mortgages and head to the grates? CBO’s estimates of the effects of the GOP bill are deeply flawed. They begin with rosy assumptions about the current law. In the face of considerable contrary evidence, they assume that insurers will continue to sell in the exchanges next year and that there will be no appreciable disruption in coverage. They appear to believe that higher coverage rates that have occurred since 2014 are more attributable to tax penalties than to subsidies, despite feckless IRS enforcement. And they assume that even if Congress keeps the tax credits and Medicaid expansion in place next year and spends additional money to stabilize insurance markets, 14 million more people will join the ranks of the uninsured. Congress should set policy based on reality, not on CBO’s speculations. Obamacare exchanges are falling apart, Medicaid spending is growing at an excessive pace, and taxing the uninsured is both ineffective and politically unsustainable. The House and Senate should act now to stabilize those markets, repeal the law (including the individual mandate), and replace it with a system that puts doctors and patients in control of health-care decision-making.

2585,"Come November, the grim trudge across the increasingly barren Obamacare landscape begins anew. Illinois consumers likely face staggering price hikes for individual insurance policies. Some types of plans could cost an average of 43 percent to 55 percent more. Ditto across the country: A first tranche of states approved 2017 rates with similarly cardiac-arrest-inducing premium increases.

Many Illinois consumers will find fewer choices because major carriers fled this market. UnitedHealthcare bolted. So did Aetna. Land of Lincoln Health collapsed mid-year, leaving policy holders to scramble for coverage that could cost them plenty. In many places across Illinois and the nation, people will find drastically fewer choices of plans than they did last year.

States struggling with Obamacare are undermining the law
The Affordable Care Act has been criticized since it was passed in 2010. Its success depended on states supporting their marketplaces and enrolling healthy consumers. Sept. 7, 2016.
Those insurers fled because they didn't want to lose more money on a government-run market that is so far out of whack — a market they think likely will never be profitable for them. That isn't surprising, as we enumerate below.

But by diagnosing Obamacare, all of us can see the mistakes that any repair or replacement can avoid. So let's look at the failings and how they can drive solutions:

Obamacare failed because it flunked Economics 101 and Human Nature 101. It straitjacketed insurers into providing overly expensive, soup-to-nuts policies. It wasn't flexible enough so that people could buy as much coverage as they wanted and could afford — not what the government dictated. Many healthy people primarily want catastrophic coverage. Obamacare couldn't lure them in, couldn't persuade them to buy on the chance they'd get sick.

Obamacare failed because the penalties for going uncovered are too low when stacked against its skyrocketing premium costs. Next year, the penalty for staying uninsured is $695 per adult, or perhaps 2.5 percent of a family's taxable household income. That's far less than many Americans would pay for coverage.

Obamacare failed because insurance is based on risk pools — that is, the lucky subsidize the unlucky. The unlucky who have big health problems (and big medical bills) reap much greater benefits than those who remain healthy and out of the doctors' office. But Obamacare's rules hamstring insurers. They can't exclude people for pre-existing conditions, and can't charge older customers more than three times as much as the young. Those are good goals, but they skew the market in ways Obamacare didn't figure out how to offset. Result: Young and healthy consumers pay far more in premiums than their claims (probably) would justify in order to subsidize the unexpectedly large influx of older, sicker customers who require expensive care. Too many unlucky people, too few lucky people: That will collapse any insurance scheme.

Obamacare failed because it allowed Americans to sign up after they got sick and needed help paying all those medical bills. Insurance should be structured so that, although you don't know if you'll need it, you pay for it anyway, just in case; your alternative is financial doom. But if you can game the system and, for example, buy auto coverage after you crash into your garage, then you have no incentive to buy insurance beforehand.

Obamacare failed because it hasn't tamed U.S. medical costs. Health care is about supply and demand: People who get coverage use it, especially if the law mandates free preventive care. Iron law of economics: Nothing is free; someone pays. To pretend otherwise was folly. Those forces combined to spike the costs of care, and thus insurance costs.

Obamacare failed because too many carriers simply can't cover expenses, let alone turn a profit, in this rigidly controlled system. Take Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, the state's dominant Obamacare insurer. Last year, for every dollar the carrier collected, it spent $1.32 buying care and providing services for customers, according to BCBS President Maurice Smith. No wonder BCBS is proposing rate increases from 23 percent to 45 percent for its individual plans.

A question looms: Is Obamacare plunging in a so-called insurance death spiral? Is the market so unstable that plans are doomed to get more and more expensive, driving more Americans and more insurers out of the market until ... Obamacare thuds to the pavement?

More Americans have health insurance, for now
We won't predict that, but neither do we see a mathematical alternative. What's clear is that the solutions to Obamacare are implicit in its failures. A repaired or replaced system has to be more flexible, letting insurers offer a wider range of plans so that consumers, not lawmakers or bureaucrats, dictate what's best for them. That system should protect those who carry continuous coverage, not coddle those who duck in and out of plans when their health needs change.

A new system also should scrap the job-killing Obamacare mandates that discourage companies from hiring and discourage workers from adding hours. Instead of gearing subsidies to incomes, let Americans not covered via an employer reap tax credits to help finance their insurance purchases on the open market. And tell us again: Why can't insurers sell policies across state lines? Imagine the pricing competition that would unleash.

We can deny the current system's failings, or we can parlay our evolving knowledge into something much better.

Put another way: The next president and Congress either reckon with Obamacare's failures or ... wait for the thud."
2586,"Remember how much Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare?

The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has voted more than 50 times to repeal the law. Conservatives have twice brought challenges to the Supreme Court — a court with powerful voices that often lean in their direction — only to be largely rebuffed both times. The last government shutdown was driven by Republicans who insisted on defunding Obamacare (not to be confused with what may be the next government shutdown, driven by Republicans insisting on defunding Planned Parenthood).

Some suggest that the calls for repealing Obamacare are fading. Sarah Kliff argued that the “near-complete absence of Obama’s health overhaul” in last week’s Republican presidential debate was “remarkable.”

Maybe, but don’t count on it. In GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s white paper on how he would get to 4 percent growth through supply-side tax cuts, his team of economists stresses that repealing the Affordable Care Act will be an “important means of enhancing economic growth.” Front-runner Donald Trump said just last week that he was going to replace Obamacare with “DonaldCare,” which would be both “absolutely great” and “really spectacular.” Repealing health-care reform remains a prominent talking point for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz, both GOP presidential candidates.

Well, since we don’t know what’s in it, I can’t comment on DonaldCare.

But I can tell you this about Obamacare: When it comes to meeting one of its most important goals — providing coverage to the uninsured — it is working extremely well. It’s posting historical gains on this front and, in so doing, both insulating itself from repeal and creating a daunting political challenge for its opponents.

The facts of the case are thoroughly drawn out in this new analysis by my colleagues Matt Broaddus and Edwin Park (B&P) from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:

— As the figure above shows, newly released census data show that the share of those without health coverage fell from 13.3 percent to 10.4 last year.

— That’s the largest single-year drop on record based on data going back to 1987.

hi2
Source: B&P (see text)
— In this type of work, the strength of your findings are much bolstered when you see them across multiple sources. As B&P point out, the census findings are “consistent with the historic coverage gains measured in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey and several private surveys…at 9.2 percent, the CDC’s estimated uninsured rate for the first quarter of 2015 was the lowest since the CDC began collecting these data in 1997 and more than 40 percent below the peak in 2010.”

— The ACA takes a two-pronged attack on covering the uninsured, subsidizing private coverage through the exchanges and expanding Medicaid in the 25 states (as well as D.C.) that accepted that part of the deal. Both private and public coverage are making significant gains.

— Speaking of anti-Obamacare ideology and its effect on people, B&P provide this revealing calculation: “If the uninsured rate had fallen in non-expansion states at the same rate as in expansion states, an additional 2.6 million uninsured Americans would have gained coverage last year.”

— Coverage last year grew most quickly among households with income below $50,000; their uninsured rate fell from about 20 percent to about 15 percent — in one year! Households above $50,000 had lower uninsured rates to start with, so we would expect smaller changes, but they, too, went from 9 percent to 7.4 percent.

Such truths are more than inconvenient for sworn enemies of the law. They can bob and weave in their primaries, but once they reach the general election, their Democratic opponent will slam them on these points. And unless they’re willing to massively flip — pretty unimaginable, given the heat generated by the issue for conservatives — people represented in the numbers and charts above will rightfully fear that their health security is at stake.

I cannot overemphasize the importance of these facts, and, yes, I know better than most that our political discourse too often exists in a fact-free zone. But the success of the ACA strikes at the heart of the dysfunction strategy employed extremely effectively by anti-government conservatives. This is the self-fulfilling-prophecy strategy that campaigns on: “Washington is broken! Send me there and I’ll make sure it stays that way!”

Remember, when government messes up, when it shuts down, when it fails to address the things that matter to most people — economic opportunity, wage stagnation, affordable college — and, instead, squabbles about Planned Parenthood, the winners are those who can say: “See? We told you. Government’s broken!” Never mind that those making that case are the ones doing the breaking.

But with Obamacare, they’ve been failing, and the more we elevate that case, the closer we get to the road back to Factville."
